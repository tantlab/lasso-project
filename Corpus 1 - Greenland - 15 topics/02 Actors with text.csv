au,https://phd.tech.au.dk/programmes/environmental-science/ https://dce.au.dk/en/ ,"Environmental science provides an integrated interdisciplinary approach to research in the functioning and management of complex environmental systems that requires the involvement of both quantitative and qualitative science domains. Environmental Science research takes departure in both natural and social science disciplines, and includes both disciplinary and interdisciplinary approaches. Environmental Science has a particular emphasis on tackling the major challenges that face society like pollution and pollution control mechanisms, management of soil, water, air and biodiversity, protection of ecosystem service delivery, climate change, and energy systems. These challenges are creating a growing need for scientists with rigorous interdisciplinary scientific training and Environmental Science offers a curriculum that is designed to prepare students for future leadership within this discipline. As already stated environmental science is highly interdisciplinary and ranges from physics, chemistry, microbiology, geography, mathematics, and computer science, to social science, economics and policy. Central in environmental science studies are anthropogenic but also natural emissions to the environment starting a complex chain of processes involving transport, chemical and physical transformations and impact of the directly emitted species or their products on climate, nature, well-being and health. The studies related to social science includes investigations of what controls our decisions and behaviour and how these affects environmental pressures. Another branch of studies concern improving our understanding of governing physical, chemical and biological processes controlling the fate of pollutants emitted to the environment. Studies include development of new analytical methods, application of state-of-the-art analytical instruments to for carrying out field investigations as well as development and application of mathematical models in the aim of improving our understanding of governing processes in the environment, but also in evaluating the efficiencies of various abatement strategies and policy tools in environmental management.
Examples of areas of research are:
Environmental Science hosts several environmental analytical laboratories providing state-of-the-art facilities for measurements in all environmental media and matrices. Such measurements include routine analysis of simple parameters, accredited analysis within (inter)national monitoring programs and high end measurements of pollutants at trace levels with e.g. GC-MS, LC-MS and GC-HRMS. The microbiology laboratories provide additional facilities for the environmental research of microorganisms, pollutants and their interactions. Environmental Sciences has a large expertise in long-term monitoring and intensive campaigns and studies of long time series of chemical and physical parameters in the atmosphere relevant for describing the fate of pollutants, particles and green house gases. Computer facilities include access to power full computer resources both in-house and at the University for developing and applying mathematical models. Environmental Science has access to modern GIS environment for geographical analysis of emission and land use data, generation of various input data for mathematical models etc.
Environmental Science is national focal point for the Danish EPA and the European Environment Agency (EEA) on atmospheric emissions of green house gases and air pollutants under a contract under the Danish National Centre for Environment and Energy. Environmental Science is national focal point for the Danish EPA and the European Environment Agency (EEA) on air quality in Denmark and maintains, operate and report in this context the monitoring results obtained within the NOVANA (det Nye Overvågningsprogram for Vandmiljø og Natur) programme on air pollution loads and levels in relation to the EU air quality guidelines, as well as within the AMAP (Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme) programme on pollutant loads to Greenland. Environmental Science is partner of the Nordic Centre of Excellence in climate adaption research NORDSTAR, and of the network ECOGLOBE which is a network for interdisciplinary phd studies in climate change, land use changes etc.
Students from Environmental Science obtain skills and knowledge which is crucial in Environmental Management in municipalities, Agencies under the Ministry of Environment, European Environment Agency, EU etc, but also provide the perfect basis for working in Environmental Consultancy or other parts of the private sector (e.g. biotech companies). Other students continue in Environmental Research at AU or at other universities in Denmark or abroad.
The Environmental Science is currently located at Frederiksborgvej 399, 4000 Roskilde at the Risø Campus. The department operates the Danish Air Quality Monitoring Programme under NOVANA. In this context the employees at the department perform routine measurements at monitoring sites in both rural and urban areas. The latter includes measurements at street and urban background stations in the four largest cities in the country (Copenhagen, Aarhus, Odense and Aalborg). In addition the department operates Air Quality Monitoring in the Arctic, which includes performing measurements at station North in Greenland.
The Environmental Science has a close cooperation with researchers at most of the other Danish universities and in addition a number of other research organisations and institutes. An example is the cooperation with Danish physicians in environmental and occupational medicine on assessing health effects of environmental exposures. Another example is the cooperation with Danish Environmental Economic Council on valuation of impact of environmental pressures.
The Environmental Science takes part in a variety of international societies and networks: COST actions, ACCENT research network, PEER (Partnership for European Environmental Research) cooperation (the PEER partnership include seven major environmental research institutes in Europe) network, Landscape Europe, Arctic Centre of Research and Arctic Science partnership, International Union for Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC), European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme (EMEP), European Geophysical Union (EGU). Environmental Science is a leading partner in the Baltic Nest Institute Denmark, dealing with development and decision support for the Baltic Sea environment. Environmental Science takes part in various national and international scientific board committees like e.g. the Scientific Committee of the European Environment Agency (EEA).
The Environmental Science has currently about 35 PhD and Post Doc students. The goal is to increase this number and to form a vibrant study environment for current and future students.

Environmental health entails grasping the effects of environment and human-made vulnerabilities/ hazards and insulation of human health and environmental systems from these hazards. This involves examining and evaluating the effects of chemicals made by humans on human health or wildlife and how the ecological systems impact the spread of illnesses. It can include everything from managing the use of pesticides to the quality of drywall used in construction.
It is a healthcare area that is gaining increasing attention around the world as there are more studies proving that the impact of environmental health extends beyond the individual and can determine the cost of public health care and the health of the local economy. In short, environmental health is the study of how environmental factors can harm human health and how we can identify and control such effects.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO),
“Environmental health addresses all the physical, chemical, and biological factors external to a person, and all the related factors impacting behaviours. It encompasses the assessment and control of those environmental factors that can potentially affect health.
It is targeted towards preventing disease and creating health-supportive environments. This definition excludes behaviour not related to environment, as well as behaviour related to the social and cultural environment, and genetics.”
When researchers and monitors assess the environmental health of a person or community, they are looking at how external elements are impacting the mental, emotional and physical health of the individual and at large. They can come in to do assessments that are focused on decreasing epidemics or childhood morbidity, as well as to improve the overall preventative healthcare measures in the area.
Environmental health regulations can extend to cover housing, transportation, food and water management as well. There is not one aspect of life that is not covered by environmental health as it recognizes the interrelation of all areas of economy and community on a person’s health state.

Kinds of Environmental Hazards
Humans stumble across numerous environmental hazards every single day. To better understand environmental health, let’s classify them into four categories:
1. Biological hazards
Biological hazards emanate from environmental relations between organisms. Some examples of biological hazards include bacteria, viruses, fungi, spores, pathogenic micro-organisms, tuberculosis, malaria and so on.
When these diseases and pathogens are transmitted between two or more organisms, we call it an infectious disease. The real reason humans suffer from these pathogens and diseases is that they are being infested by other organisms, which is a natural process, but at the same time hazardous.
2. Physical hazards
These are physical processes that happen naturally in the environment, for example, natural disasters like volcanoes, earthquakes, droughts, landslides, blizzards, and tornadoes. Physical hazards are considered secret events, but not all.
For instance, a few like UV radiation are openly happening each day. Ultraviolet radiation is categorized as hazardous since too much exposure to it destroys the DNA and triggers health complications in humans, such as cataracts and skin cancer.
3. Chemical hazards
They occur in ecological systems in two ways; human-made or natural. Examples of naturally occurring chemical hazards include mercury and lead, which are considered heavy metals. Human-made chemical hazards encompass lots of synthetic chemicals humans produce, such as pesticides, plastics, and disinfectants.
A few organisms even generate natural chemicals, which are hazardous to the environment, for instance, elements contained in peanuts and dairy that trigger allergic reactions to humans.
4. Cultural hazards
They are sometimes referred to as social hazards. They originate from your locality, behavioral choices, occupation, and social-economic status. Examples of cultural hazards include cigarette smoking, which is detrimental to human health. Cigarette smoking is considered a behavior choice.
If you reside in a neighborhood full of criminal activities, it is classified as a hazard-based on your locality. In equal measure, your diet choice, workout habits, and main means of transportation all impact your overall health and the health of the ecological system around you.
Critical Issues Related to Environmental Health
Healthier environments could prevent almost one-quarter of the global burden of disease. The COVID-19 pandemic reminds us of the delicate relationship between people and our planet.Adequate water, clean air, sound agricultural practices, a stable climate, sanitation and hygiene, healthy and safe workplaces, safe use of chemicals, protection from radiation, health-supportive cities and built environments, and a preserved nature are all prerequisites for good health. Environmental health addresses all human health-related issues, which include:-
1. Handling Issues of Disease Control
Disease mitigation and control is one main aspect affecting environmental health. This can be paraphrased as assisting in building up or improve waste management systems to prevent the possibility of waste polluting drinking water sources or triggering the spread of illnesses.
In parts of the globe that industrialization is revolutionizing the local community’s living standards, education programs might be initiated that display acts of public health hygiene. The materials and techniques related to the progress of industry are also linked to the growth of infectious diseases if individuals that live there are not in sync with the requirements of proper hygiene and handling of waste items.
2. Food Management
Food management is a well-known issue that affects environmental health. Food management regulations will concern everything from how a seed is harvested and prepared to what types of fertilizer and pesticides are used to nurture the crops to maturity.
The authorities will also examine processing, packaging and storage facilities for food products to ensure that all food items are safe for human consumption, and there is less risk for contamination or food spoilage.
In other scenarios, environmental health might also tackle the transportation requirement of food because the road or rail network in some countries may not be good enough to enable the prompt reach of food supplies to the population.
3. Water Quality Issues
Guaranteeing that portable or enough drinking water will be readily obtainable to the local community is yet another main aspect of environmental health. Environmental health campaigners will look to find ways of developing water reserves that can be wholly cushioned from the possibility of contamination. These environmental advocates not only look towards drinking and cooking water but making sure there is the availability of enough water for crop irrigation.
Another aspect of water control is to make sure that proper drainage systems are in place. Ensuring appropriate drainage is in place is due to health concerns that may be instigated by stagnant water and how it can contribute to the existence of diseases carried along by mosquitoes that commonly breed in stagnant water.
4. Housing and Transportation
Environmental health also looks at the quality and condition of transportation and housing. In recent times, an example of how environmental health helped to change and shape building policies is the focus on removing lead and asbestos from buildings.
Transportation can become a concern for environmental health if the local community isn’t connected to any form of public transportation or there is no sufficient infrastructure to enable them access opportunities and services that are in proximity to them.
5. Air Pollution
Air pollution kills an estimated 7 million people worldwide every year. WHO data shows that 9 out of 10 people breathe air that exceeds WHO guideline limits containing high levels of pollutants, with low- and middle-income countries suffering from the highest exposures.
From smog hanging over cities to smoke inside the home, air pollution poses a major threat to health and climate. The combined effects of ambient (outdoor) and household air pollution cause about seven million premature deaths every year, largely as a result of increased mortality from stroke, heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer and acute respiratory infections.
6. Climate Change
Climate change is impacting human lives and health in a variety of ways. It threatens the essential ingredients of good health – clean air, safe drinking water, nutritious food supply, and safe shelter – and has the potential to undermine decades of progress in global health.
Between 2030 and 2050, climate change is expected to cause approximately 250 000 additional deaths per year from malnutrition, malaria, diarrhea and heat stress alone. The direct damage costs to health is estimated to be between USD 2-4 billion per year by 2030.
Areas with weak health infrastructure, mostly in developing countries, will be the least able to cope without assistance to prepare and respond.
7. Chemicals Safety
Chemical Safety is achieved by undertaking all activities involving chemicals in such a way as to ensure the safety of human health and the environment. It covers all chemicals, natural and manufactured, and the full range of exposure situations from the natural presence of chemicals in the environment to their extraction or synthesis, industrial production, transport use and disposal.
Chemical safety has many scientific and technical components. Among these are toxicology, ecotoxicology and the process of chemical risk assessment, which requires detailed knowledge of exposure and of biological effects.
8. Children’s Environmental Health
In 2012, 1.7 million deaths in children under five were attributable to the environment. These included 570 000 deaths from respiratory infections, 361 000 deaths from diarrhea, 270 000 deaths from neonatal conditions, 200 000 deaths from malaria and 200 000 deaths from unintentional injuries as per WHO. Reducing environmental risks could prevent 1 in 4 child deaths.
Environmental risks have an impact on the health and development of children, from conception through childhood and adolescence and also into adulthood. The environment determines a child’s future: early life exposures impact adult health as fetal programming and early growth may be altered by environmental risk factors.
Children are particularly vulnerable to certain environmental risks, including air pollution, inadequate water, sanitation and hygiene; hazardous chemicals and waste, radiation; climate change, as well as emerging threats like e-waste. These are major contributors to childhood deaths, illnesses and disability.
Apart from the list above, environmental health also address issues related to:
- Solid Waste Management which includes recycling facilities, landfills and composting.
- Management of medical waste such as mitigation of dangerous materials from finding way to the ecological system.
- Hazardous Materials Management.
- Ultraviolet radiation, radiation and emergencies related to radiation
- Occupational Health and promoting the improvement of working conditions and other aspects of environmental hygiene.
The Paris Agreement on climate change is, therefore, potentially the strongest health agreement of this century. WHO supports countries in assessing the health gains that would result from the implementation of the existing Nationally Determined Contributions to the Paris Agreement and the potential for larger gains from more ambitious climate action.
Climate Change and its Grave Impacts on the Immediate Environment
Environmental health also deals with aspects of climate change and how it impacts the environment. Climate change could cause:
Rising Temperatures
If climate change is not mitigated, temperatures could go way up, resulting in more heatwaves and fires, severe droughts and rains are likely to be intense when they finally come, and this could cause severe floods.
Rising Sea Levels
Many take seas and oceans for granted. They slow down climate change and absorb greenhouse gasses and heat, which could be detrimental to human health. This becomes more pronounced each day, and marine life could be impacted, and all kinds of life on the planet will be impacted in the near future.
Global Initiatives in Environmental Health
The World Health Organization spearheads the largest global environmental health initiative in existence. Their focus is primarily on the prevention of epidemics and to improve infant and child morbidity rates in developing countries through increasing the healthfulness of the environment of the community. They oversee projects that involve everything from vaccination programs to water processing plant construction.
Where there is a community, there is a need to examine the state of environmental health for that community and the individuals it supports. The impact of individual health is what determines the health of the country’s economy in all aspects.
Statistics are stark; according to the World Health Organization (WHO), approximately 12.6 million people died in 2012 due to working or living in an unhealthy environment. This figure represents 1 in 4 total worldwide deaths according to recent surveys by the same organization. Environmental health risk factors, for instance, water, air, climate change, ultraviolet rays, climate exposures, soil, and pollution, play a role in over 100 injuries and diseases.
By centering on minimizing environmental and social risk factors, close to a quarter of the world’s disease burden can be mitigated. Some classic examples of measures that will ensure environmental health is on par include excellent hygiene measures, boosting safe water storage, efficient and reliable administration of toxic compounds at home and workplace.
On top of that, affirmative action by sectors like agriculture, transport, and energy is needed promptly, in collaboration with the health sector, to deal with causes of social and environmental ill health that are out of reach of the health sector. .

The Arctic's unique nature is still relatively undisturbed. It is very rich in resources such as hydrocarbons and fish stocks. However, it is under intensifying pressure from pollution, climate change and unsustainable development. It is vitally important that increasing economic development such as hydrocarbon exploitation and new shipping routes takes fully into account the preservation of this unique and highly vulnerable environment. Some four million people live in the Arctic region including nearly half a million EU citizens.
Three EU Member States - Denmark (Greenland), Finland and Sweden — have territories in the Arctic. Two other Arctic states - Iceland and Norway - are members of the European Economic Area. Canada, Russia and the United States are strategic partners of the EU. European Arctic areas are a priority in the Northern Dimension policy. Beyond areas of national jurisdiction, the Arctic Ocean contains parts pertaining to the high seas and the seabed managed by the International Seabed Authority.
The EU is a party to the Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-west Atlantic (OSPAR) which covers about one-third of the Arctic Ocean up to the North Pole. Many other multilateral environmental agreements apply to the Arctic to some extent (where Arctic States are parties). The European Union's application to become a Permanent Observer on the Arctic Council was received affirmatively by the Kiruna ministerial (May 2013) but the final decision on implementation is still pending. The EU is a member of the Barents Euro-Arctic Council (BEAC).
The Arctic is a key driver of the world ocean and climate system and plays a vitally important part in many other environmental issues. The impact of climate change on the Arctic is already evident. Continuation of these trends would have profound consequences both for the Arctic and the global environment.
Key issues include:
Long range transport of pollution - the Arctic is a global sink for contaminants discharged from industry, energy production, agriculture and other human activities. Persistent organic pollutants and mercury are of special concern. Contaminants are concentrated in the thick fat tissues that Arctic animals need for insulation and energy reserve, and which are consumed by humans.
Biodiversity - some ecosystems and species are clearly put at risk; maybe most clearly the hundreds of endemic species specially adapted for life on the sea ice. Many migrating species from Europe depend on the high productivity of the Arctic ecosystems in summer for foraging and reproduction: birds, whales, fish – some of them commercially harvested with high economic value.
Environmental impacts of economic development – increasing oil, gas and mineral exploration, shipping and tourism puts pressure on the vulnerable Arctic environment. It is essential to have clear and effective policies in place to manage these risks.
Knowledge and understanding of the Arctic environment – the EU is making a major contribution to research, monitoring and assessment of Arctic environmental issues and trends through funding of projects under the EU Research Framework Programmes and through the assessments that were carried out by the European Environment Agency.
The EU role
The EU is committed to working with the Arctic States, local communities and other stakeholders to address these environmental challenges. In 2016, the Commission and the High Representative published a Joint Communication on an integrated EU policy for the Arctic structured around three priorities, namely:
An update to the 2016 EU Arctic Communication is foreseen for 2021.
In addition, the Arctic was also identified as a priority in other strategic documents such as the EU Global Strategy and the 7th Environmental Action Programme.
In 2010, DG Environment funded a study to assess the EU's environmental footprint on the Arctic and to assess policy options to reduce the footprint. Details of the study can be found here. An update of this work is underway as part of an ongoing study into the EU’s impact on the Arctic (due for completion in 2021).
Link: EEAS Arctic Policy https://eeas.europa.eu/arctic-policy/eu-arctic-policy_en . The Waste Framework Directive lays down some basic waste management principles. It requires that waste be managed
- without endangering human health and harming the environment
- without risk to water, air, soil, plants or animals
- without causing a nuisance through noise or odours
- and without adversely affecting the countryside or places of special interest
It explains when waste ceases to be waste and becomes a secondary raw material, and how to distinguish between waste and by-products. The Directive also introduces the ""polluter pays principle"" and the ""extended producer responsibility"".
The foundation of EU waste management is the five-step “waste hierarchy”, established in the Waste Framework Directive. It establishes an order of preference for managing and disposing of waste.
Targets
To comply with the objectives of this Directive, EU countries shall take the necessary measures to achieve the following targets
- by 2020, the preparing for re-use and the recycling of waste materials (such as paper, metal, plastic and glass) from households shall be increased to a minimum of overall 50 % by weight
- by 2020, the preparing for re-use, recycling and other material recovery, including backfilling operations using waste to substitute other materials, of non-hazardous construction and demolition waste shall be increased to a minimum of 70 % by weight
- by 2025, the preparing for re-use and the recycling of municipal waste shall be increased to a minimum of 55 %, 60% and 65% by weight by 2025, 2030 and 2035 respectively
The rules and calculation methods for verifying compliance with these targets can be found in Commission Decision 2011/753/EU. Additional rules for the calculation, verification and reporting of data on waste in accordance with the amended Waste Framework Directive can be found in Commission Decision (EU) 2019/1004.
The Commission provides guidance on municipal waste data collection, which can be found here.
Hazardous waste
Hazardous wastes pose a greater risk to the environment and human health than non-hazardous waste and therefore require a stricter control regime.
The Waste Framework Directive provides additional labelling, record keeping, monitoring and control obligations from the ""cradle to the grave"", in other words from the waste production to the final disposal or recovery. It also bans the mixing of hazardous waste with other categories of hazardous waste, and with non-hazardous waste.
The classification into hazardous and non-hazardous waste is based on the system for the classification and labelling of dangerous substances and preparations. This ensures that similar principles are applied over the whole life cycle of materials.
For more information on the classification of all types of waste (including hazardous), see the European List of Waste.
Read the guidelines on the separate collection of household hazardous waste.
By-products
The Waste Framework Directive defines by-products as a substance or object, resulting from a production process, the primary aim of which is not the production of that item. By-products can come from a wide range of business sectors, and can have very different environmental impacts. It is important to classify by-products correctly to avoid environmental damage or unnecessary costs for business.
End-of-waste criteria
End-of-waste criteria specify when certain waste ceases to be waste and becomes a product, or a secondary raw material.
According to Article 6 (1) and (2) of the Waste Framework Directive, certain specified waste ceases to be waste when it has undergone a recovery operation (including recycling) and complies with specific criteria, in particular when
- the substance or object is commonly used for specific purposes
- there is an existing market or demand for the substance or object
- the use is lawful (substance or object fulfils the technical requirements for the specific purposes and meets the existing legislation and standards applicable to products)
- the use will not lead to overall adverse environmental or human health impacts
This criteria for specific materials is set by the Commission through the “comitology” procedure. A mandate to set end-of-waste criteria was introduced to provide a high level of environmental protection and an environmental and economic benefit. They aim to further encourage recycling in the EU by creating legal certainty and a level playing field as well as removing unnecessary administrative burden.
How are the end-of-waste criteria being developed?
A methodology to develop the criteria has been published by the Joint Research Centre.
The Commission is preparing a set of end-of-waste criteria for priority waste streams. These criteria have been laid down for
- iron, steel and aluminium scrap (see Council Regulation (EU) N° 333/2011)
- glass cullet (see Commission Regulation (EU) N° 1179/2012)
- copper scrap (see Commission Regulation (EU) N° 715/2013)

Climate change affects our societies and environment in many ways. Tackling climate change requires cutting emissions to mitigate its worst impacts and adapting to those we cannot stop. Opening today, European Environment Agency’s (EEA) photo competition ‘Climate Change PIX’ invites participants to depict what climate change looks like in Europe and how we are responding to it.
Working with nature and enhancing the role of ecosystems can help reduce the impacts of climate change and increase climate change resilience. Such an approach can deliver multiple benefits, including lowering pressures on biodiversity, improving human health and well-being, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and building a sustainable economy, according to a European Environment Agency (EEA) report published today.
Train travel remains overall the most environmentally friendly mode of motorised passenger transport in Europe — in terms of greenhouse gas emissions — as compared to travelling by car or plane, according to two transport and environment studies published by the European Environment Agency (EEA) today.

Europe's seas are precious. Our quality of life, livelihoods and economies depend on them being in good condition. Our seas are home to many species, habitats and ecosystems. They also provide our societies with vital ecosystem services, including food, energy, clean air and climate change mitigation. However, through the continued unsustainable use of Europe’s seas, we have altered their physio-chemical environment, and their habitats and ecosystems. The resilience of our seas is eroding, while their ecosystems, habitats and biodiversity, and the services they provide are under significant threat. This briefing summarises the current state of biodiversity in Europe’s seas.
Nature-based solutions in Europe: Policy, knowledge and practice for climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction
Working with nature can help prevent the worst impacts of climate change, and biodiversity and ecosystem loss. Nature-based solutions offer ways to do this. Science and policy have begun to recognise their potential. The knowledge base is expanding rapidly, with gaps identified and plans to fill them. However, challenges for implementation remain at the local level, as demonstrated by the case studies in this report.

ucsusa,https://www.ucsusa.org/resources/environmental-impacts-geothermal-energy https://www.ucsusa.org/resources/benefits-renewable-energy-use ,"The most widely developed type of geothermal power plant (known as hydrothermal plants) are located near geologic “hot spots” where hot molten rock is close to the earth’s crust and produces hot water. In other regions enhanced geothermal systems (or hot dry rock geothermal), which involve drilling into Earth’s surface to reach deeper geothermal resources, can allow broader access to geothermal energy.
Geothermal plants also differ in terms of the technology they use to convert the resource to electricity (direct steam, flash, or binary) and the type of cooling technology they use (water-cooled and air-cooled). Environmental impacts will differ depending on the conversion and cooling technology used.
Water quality and use
Geothermal power plants can have impacts on both water quality and consumption. Hot water pumped from underground reservoirs often contains high levels of sulfur, salt, and other minerals. Most geothermal facilities have closed-loop water systems, in which extracted water is pumped directly back into the geothermal reservoir after it has been used for heat or electricity production. In such systems, the water is contained within steel well casings cemented to the surrounding rock [1]. There have been no reported cases of water contamination from geothermal sites in the United States [2].
Water is also used by geothermal plants for cooling and re-injection. All U.S. geothermal power facilities use wet-recirculating technology with cooling towers. Depending on the cooling technology used, geothermal plants can require between 1,700 and 4,000 gallons of water per megawatt-hour. However, most geothermal plants can use either geothermal fluid or freshwater for cooling; the use of geothermal fluids rather than freshwater clearly reduces the plants overall water impact [3]. (For more information, see How it Works: Water for Power Plant Cooling.)
Most geothermal plants re-inject water into the reservoir after it has been used to prevent contamination and land subsidence (see Land Use below). In most cases, however, not all water removed from the reservoir is re-injected because some is lost as steam. In order to maintain a constant volume of water in the reservoir, outside water must be used. The amount of water needed depends on the size of the plant and the technology used; however, because reservoir water is “dirty,"" it is often not necessary to use clean water for this purpose. For example, the Geysers geothermal site in California injects non-potable treated wastewater into its geothermal reservoir [4].
Air emissions
The distinction between open- and closed-loop systems is important with respect to air emissions. In closed-loop systems, gases removed from the well are not exposed to the atmosphere and are injected back into the ground after giving up their heat, so air emissions are minimal. In contrast, open-loop systems emit hydrogen sulfide, carbon dioxide, ammonia, methane, and boron. Hydrogen sulfide, which has a distinctive “rotten egg” smell, is the most common emission [5].
Once in the atmosphere, hydrogen sulfide changes into sulfur dioxide (SO2). This contributes to the formation of small acidic particulates that can be absorbed by the bloodstream and cause heart and lung disease [6]. Sulfur dioxide also causes acid rain, which damages crops, forests, and soils, and acidifies lakes and streams. However, SO2 emissions from geothermal plants are approximately 30 times lower per megawatt-hour than from coal plants, which is the nation’s largest SO2 source.
Some geothermal plants also produce small amounts of mercury emissions, which must be mitigated using mercury filter technology. Scrubbers can reduce air emissions, but they produce a watery sludge composed of the captured materials, including sulfur, vanadium, silica compounds, chlorides, arsenic, mercury, nickel, and other heavy metals. This toxic sludge often must be disposed of at hazardous waste sites [7].
Land use
The amount of land required by a geothermal plant varies depending on the properties of the resource reservoir, the amount of power capacity, the type of energy conversion system, the type of cooling system, the arrangement of wells and piping systems, and the substation and auxiliary building needs [8]. The Geysers, the largest geothermal plant in the world, has a capacity of approximately 1,517 megawatts and the area of the plant is approximately 78 square kilometers, which translates to approximately 13 acres per megawatt. Like the Geysers, many geothermal sites are located in remote and sensitive ecological areas, so project developers must take this into account in their planning processes.
Land subsidence, a phenomenon in which the land surface sinks, is sometimes caused by the removal of water from geothermal reservoirs. Most geothermal facilities address this risk by re-injecting wastewater back into geothermal reservoirs after the water’s heat has been captured.
Hydrothermal plants are sited on geological “hot spots,"" which tend to have higher levels of earthquake risk. There is evidence that hydrothermal plants can lead to an even greater earthquake frequency [9]. Enhanced geothermal systems (hot dry rock) can also increase the risk of small earthquakes. In this process, water is pumped at high pressures to fracture underground hot rock reservoirs similar to technology used in natural gas hydraulic fracturing. (See How Natural Gas Works for more information.) Earthquake risk associated with enhanced geothermal systems can be minimized by siting plants an appropriate distance away from major fault lines. When a geothermal system is sited near a heavily populated area, constant monitoring and transparent communication with local communities is also necessary [10].
Life-cycle global warming emissions
In open-loop geothermal systems, approximately 10 percent of the air emissions are carbon dioxide, and a smaller amount of emissions are methane, a more potent global warming gas. Estimates of global warming emissions for open-loop systems are approximately 0.1 pounds of carbon dioxide equivalent per kilowatt-hour. In closed-loop systems, these gases are not released into the atmosphere, but there are a still some emissions associated with plant construction and surrounding infrastructure.
Enhanced geothermal systems, which require energy to drill and pump water into hot rock reservoirs, have life-cycle global warming emission of approximately 0.2 pounds of carbon dioxide equivalent per kilowatt-hour [11].
To put this into context, estimates of life-cycle global warming emissions for natural gas generated electricity are between 0.6 and 2 pounds of carbon dioxide equivalent per kilowatt-hour and estimates for coal-generated electricity are 1.4 and 3.6 pounds of carbon dioxide equivalent per kilowatt-hour [12].

What are the benefits of renewable energies—and how do they improve our health, environment, and economy?
This page explores the many positive impacts of clean energy, including the benefits of wind, solar, geothermal, hydroelectric, and biomass. For more information on their negative impacts—including effective solutions to avoid, minimize, or mitigate—see our page on The Environmental Impacts of Renewable Energy Technologies.
Less global warming
Human activity is overloading our atmosphere with carbon dioxide and other global warming emissions. These gases act like a blanket, trapping heat. The result is a web of significant and harmful impacts, from stronger, more frequent storms, to drought, sea level rise, and extinction.
In the United States, about 29 percent of global warming emissions come from our electricity sector. Most of those emissions come from fossil fuels like coal and natural gas [1, 2].
What is CO2e?
Carbon dioxide (CO2) is the most prevalent greenhouse gas, but other air pollutants—such as methane—also cause global warming. Different energy sources produce different amounts of these pollutants. To make comparisons easier, we use a carbon dioxide equivalent, or CO2e—the amount of carbon dioxide required to produce an equivalent amount of warming.
In contrast, most renewable energy sources produce little to no global warming emissions. Even when including “life cycle” emissions of clean energy (ie, the emissions from each stage of a technology’s life—manufacturing, installation, operation, decommissioning), the global warming emissions associated with renewable energy are minimal [3].
The comparison becomes clear when you look at the numbers. Burning natural gas for electricity releases between 0.6 and 2 pounds of carbon dioxide equivalent per kilowatt-hour (CO2E/kWh); coal emits between 1.4 and 3.6 pounds of CO2E/kWh. Wind, on the other hand, is responsible for only 0.02 to 0.04 pounds of CO2E/kWh on a life-cycle basis; solar 0.07 to 0.2; geothermal 0.1 to 0.2; and hydroelectric between 0.1 and 0.5.
Renewable electricity generation from biomass can have a wide range of global warming emissions depending on the resource and whether or not it is sustainably sourced and harvested.
Increasing the supply of renewable energy would allow us to replace carbon-intensive energy sources and significantly reduce US global warming emissions.
For example, a 2009 UCS analysis found that a 25 percent by 2025 national renewable electricity standard would lower power plant CO2 emissions 277 million metric tons annually by 2025—the equivalent of the annual output from 70 typical (600 MW) new coal plants [4].
In addition, a ground-breaking study by the US Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) explored the feasibility of generating 80 percent of the country’s electricity from renewable sources by 2050. They found that renewable energy could help reduce the electricity sector’s emissions by approximately 81 percent [5].
Improved public health
The air and water pollution emitted by coal and natural gas plants is linked with breathing problems, neurological damage, heart attacks, cancer, premature death, and a host of other serious problems. The pollution affects everyone: one Harvard University study estimated the life cycle costs and public health effects of coal to be an estimated $74.6 billion every year. That’s equivalent to 4.36 cents per kilowatt-hour of electricity produced—about one-third of the average electricity rate for a typical US home [6].
Most of these negative health impacts come from air and water pollution that clean energy technologies simply don’t produce. Wind, solar, and hydroelectric systems generate electricity with no associated air pollution emissions. Geothermal and biomass systems emit some air pollutants, though total air emissions are generally much lower than those of coal- and natural gas-fired power plants.
In addition, wind and solar energy require essentially no water to operate and thus do not pollute water resources or strain supplies by competing with agriculture, drinking water, or other important water needs. In contrast, fossil fuels can have a significant impact on water resources: both coal mining and natural gas drilling can pollute sources of drinking water, and all thermal power plants, including those powered by coal, gas, and oil, withdraw and consume water for cooling.
Biomass and geothermal power plants, like coal- and natural gas-fired power plants, may require water for cooling. Hydroelectric power plants can disrupt river ecosystems both upstream and downstream from the dam. However, NREL's 80-percent-by-2050 renewable energy study, which included biomass and geothermal, found that total water consumption and withdrawal would decrease significantly in a future with high renewables [7].
Inexhaustible energy
Strong winds, sunny skies, abundant plant matter, heat from the earth, and fast-moving water can each provide a vast and constantly replenished supply of energy. A relatively small fraction of US electricity currently comes from these sources, but that could change: studies have repeatedly shown that renewable energy can provide a significant share of future electricity needs, even after accounting for potential constraints [9].
In fact, a major government-sponsored study found that clean energy could contribute somewhere between three and 80 times its 2013 levels, depending on assumptions [8]. And the previously mentioned NREL study found that renewable energy could comfortably provide up to 80 percent of US electricity by 2050.
Jobs and other economic benefits
Compared with fossil fuel technologies, which are typically mechanized and capital intensive, the renewable energy industry is more labor intensive. Solar panels need humans to install them; wind farms need technicians for maintenance.
This means that, on average, more jobs are created for each unit of electricity generated from renewable sources than from fossil fuels.
Renewable energy already supports thousands of jobs in the United States. In 2016, the wind energy industry directly employed over 100,000 full-time-equivalent employees in a variety of capacities, including manufacturing, project development, construction and turbine installation, operations and maintenance, transportation and logistics, and financial, legal, and consulting services [10]. More than 500 factories in the United States manufacture parts for wind turbines, and wind power project installations in 2016 alone represented $13.0 billion in investments [11].
Other renewable energy technologies employ even more workers. In 2016, the solar industry employed more than 260,000 people, including jobs in solar installation, manufacturing, and sales, a 25% increase over 2015 [12]. The hydroelectric power industry employed approximately 66,000 people in 2017 [13]; the geothermal industry employed 5,800 people [14].
Increased support for renewable energy could create even more jobs. The 2009 Union of Concerned Scientists study of a 25-percent-by-2025 renewable energy standard found that such a policy would create more than three times as many jobs (more than 200,000) as producing an equivalent amount of electricity from fossil fuels [15].
In contrast, the entire coal industry employed 160,000 people in 2016 [26].
In addition to the jobs directly created in the renewable energy industry, growth in clean energy can create positive economic “ripple” effects. For example, industries in the renewable energy supply chain will benefit, and unrelated local businesses will benefit from increased household and business incomes [16].
Local governments also benefit from clean energy, most often in the form of property and income taxes and other payments from renewable energy project owners. Owners of the land on which wind projects are built often receive lease payments ranging from $3,000 to $6,000 per megawatt of installed capacity, as well as payments for power line easements and road rights-of-way. They may also earn royalties based on the project’s annual revenues. Farmers and rural landowners can generate new sources of supplemental income by producing feedstocks for biomass power facilities.
UCS analysis found that a 25-by-2025 national renewable electricity standard would stimulate $263.4 billion in new capital investment for renewable energy technologies, $13.5 billion in new landowner income from? biomass production and/or wind land lease payments, and $11.5 billion in new property tax revenue for local communities [17].
Stable energy prices
Renewable energy is providing affordable electricity across the country right now, and can help stabilize energy prices in the future.
Although renewable facilities require upfront investments to build, they can then operate at very low cost (for most clean energy technologies, the “fuel” is free). As a result, renewable energy prices can be very stable over time.
Moreover, the costs of renewable energy technologies have declined steadily, and are projected to drop even more. For example, the average price to install solar dropped more than 70 percent between 2010 and 2017 [20]. The cost of generating electricity from wind dropped 66 percent between 2009 and 2016 [21]. Costs will likely decline even further as markets mature and companies increasingly take advantage of economies of scale.
In contrast, fossil fuel prices can vary dramatically and are prone to substantial price swings. For example, there was a rapid increase in US coal prices due to rising global demand before 2008, then a rapid fall after 2008 when global demands declined [23]. Likewise, natural gas prices have fluctuated greatly since 2000 [25].
Using more renewable energy can lower the prices of and demand for natural gas and coal by increasing competition and diversifying our energy supplies. And an increased reliance on renewable energy can help protect consumers when fossil fuel prices spike.
Reliability and resilience
Wind and solar are less prone to large-scale failure because they are distributed and modular. Distributed systems are spread out over a large geographical area, so a severe weather event in one location will not cut off power to an entire region. Modular systems are composed of numerous individual wind turbines or solar arrays. Even if some of the equipment in the system is damaged, the rest can typically continue to operate.
For example, Hurricane Sandy damaged fossil fuel-dominated electric generation and distribution systems in New York and New Jersey and left millions of people without power. In contrast, renewable energy projects in the Northeast weathered Hurricane Sandy with minimal damage or disruption [25].
Water scarcity is another risk for non-renewable power plants. Coal, nuclear, and many natural gas plants depend on having sufficient water for cooling, which means that severe droughts and heat waves can put electricity generation at risk. Wind and solar photovoltaic systems do not require water to generate electricity and can operate reliably in conditions that may otherwise require closing a fossil fuel-powered plant. (For more information, see How it Works: Water for Electricity.)
The risk of disruptive events will also increase in the future as droughts, heat waves, more intense storms, and increasingly severe wildfires become more frequent due to global warming—increasing the need for resilient, clean technologies.

inhabitat,https://inhabitat.com/covid-19-and-its-effects-on-the-environment/ ,"As SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus pathogen that causes the illness COVID-19, sweeps across the globe, social distancing measures are noticeably impacting the environment. Consequently, both the preservation and restoration of environmental quality are experiencing a new normal as the pandemic continues.
Coronavirus and climate change-related conservation
COVID-19 has heightened wildlife conservation awareness. As Scientific American has cited, wildlife trade secured additional notoriety when the CDC broke the news of a zoonotic pathogen jumping from animals to humans, causing the current pandemic. Secondly, when the American Veterinary Medical Association announced the positive presence of COVID-19 in domestic animals, zoos and BioTechniques Journal likewise saw captive animals test positive with the new coronavirus. This elevated concerns for sources such as UNESCO, Time, Nature and Smithsonian Magazine about the future safety of already threatened species, like the great apes who are similar to humans. Additionally, National Geographic raised alarms on poaching proliferation in conservation reserves as rangers and keepers self-isolated.
Related: Discarded face masks now threatening wildlife habitats
Should climate change run unabated, future zoonotic disease outbreaks may become the norm, asserts Conservation International and Harvard University’s School of Public Health. Given that healthy animals living in healthy ecosystems are robust enough to resist diseases, by minimizing climate change and protecting habitats, we may be able to avoid future pandemics.
Social distancing has improved air quality
The COVID-19 crisis has forced activity freezes. Lockdowns and calls to shelter-in-place have closed schools and non-essential businesses. Minimal activity from industrial sites, factories and construction sectors has minimized the risks for toxins to escape, in turn improving air quality.
Travel bans have similarly restricted international flights. Canceled conferences, festivals, concerts and other public events have diminished interest in tourism, reports the US Travel Association. Airline ridership has slumped, and airports are as near-empty as they were in the 2001 aftermath of the 9/11 attacks. As such, aviation emissions — which accounted for 2.4% of global CO2 emissions in 2018, according to the Environmental and Energy Study Institute (EESI) — have dropped significantly.
Still, the EPA says vehicular activity contributes more to greenhouse gas emissions than airlines do. Presently, fewer people are commuting, not just in major cities, but all over the world. Traffic nowadays centers mainly around immediate household supply runs to nearby stores, trucking supply transports to retailers or wholesalers, plus commutes by those in essential industries.
Both Traffic Technology Today and The Guardian have spotlighted the United Kingdom’s reduced traffic, which has plunged by 73% “to levels not seen since 1955.” And across the Atlantic Ocean, Canadian traffic has also declined, GEOTAB disclosed. As for the U.S., not only has road travel decreased, but congestion has all but disappeared, says VentureBeat, Next City and USA Today. The decrease in congestion is critical, as idling vehicles emit more pollution.
With substantially less vehicular movement, air quality has improved by leaps and bounds. Numerous sources have covered how air quality indices of the globe’s largest metropolitan areas have improved extensively since strict coronavirus lockdowns were issued. Even NASA satellites from outer-space show the significant reductions in air pollutants, which supports EcoWatch‘s observation that the novel coronavirus pandemic has delivered the silver lining of decreased air pollution.
The Guardian added, “In China, the world’s biggest source of carbon, emissions were down about 18% between early February and mid-March – a cut of 250m tonnes, equivalent to more than half the UK’s annual output. Europe is forecast to see a reduction of around 390m tonnes. Significant falls can also be expected in the US, where passenger vehicle traffic – its major source of CO2 – has fallen by nearly 40%. Even assuming a bounceback once the lockdown is lifted, the planet is expected to see its first fall in global emissions since the 2008-9 financial crisis.”
Reduced carbon emissions and global warming
Just last week, Carbon Brief (CB) published that the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted energy use worldwide, which could cut carbon emissions by an estimated 5% of 2019’s global total. That means the coronavirus crisis is so far “trigger[ing] the largest ever annual fall in CO2 emissions in 2020, more than during any previous economic crisis or period of war.” While this is encouraging news, experts say it still may not be adequate for meeting Paris Agreement goals to keep global warming from rising above 1.5 degrees Celsius.
What’s happening with fossil fuels during the pandemic?
When the pandemic called for lockdowns, paralyzing both air and ground travel, the demand for fuel was likewise decimated. An oil price war ensued with drastic shifts in global oil politics, thus destabilizing the fossil fuel sector, reported Business Insider. Even Fortune magazine highlighted the worry about where to store the surplus oil. According to Forbes, this pushed President Trump to broker a historic deal, whereby the planet’s top oil producers — namely Saudi Arabia and Russia — agreed to cut oil production.
As Sandy Fielden, director of oil research firm Morningstar, said to the BBC, “This is an unprecedented agreement because it’s not just between Opec and Opec+…but also the largest supplier in the world which is the US as well as other G-20 countries which have agreed to support the agreement both in reducing production and also in using up some of the surface supply by putting it into storage.”
Effects on the renewable energy sector
CNBC showed the renewables industry suffering supply chain cuts and employee layoffs during the deepening COVID-19 recession. There are worries that clean energy investments appear less desirable. Construction and development projects have been delayed as lockdown periods extend. Renewables, therefore, seek slices of the stimulus package to waylay progress derailments, which even the International Energy Agency (IEA) has cautioned about.
What’s happening to climate change policy during the coronavirus pandemic?
COVID-19 could portend future pandemics, particularly if global warming unleashes unknown diseases trapped in ice. Ensuring that global warming and climate change do not disrupt our planet’s health is still of paramount importance. Green Tech Media emphasized this, saying, “Climate change didn’t stop as the world turned its attention to combating the coronavirus.” Climate activism continues, despite cancellations to large climate change-related summits, negotiations and conference meetings.
Not all climate advocacy during this time is lost. Optimism reframes these economic stimulus measures as helpful nudges for climate policy and the renewables sector to evolve for the better. Indeed, Clean Energy Wire upholds that these federally-backed stimulus packages can be leveraged to provide investment opportunities in both the infrastructure that can reduce emissions as well as in clean technologies. Science Alert, moreover, contends, “the coronavirus has forced new working-from-home habits that limit commuting, and a broader adoption of online meetings to reduce the need for long-haul business flights. This raises the prospect of long-term emissions reductions should these new work behaviours persist beyond the current global emergency.”

What are the trends in greenhouse gas emissions and concentrations and their impacts on human health and the environment?
- Importance of Greenhouse Gases
- Other Factors Affecting Climate Change
- Greenhouse Gases and Their Sources
- Impacts of Climate Change
- ROE Indicators
Importance of Greenhouse Gases
Greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and certain synthetic chemicals, trap some of the Earth's outgoing energy, thus retaining heat in the atmosphere. This heat trapping causes changes in the radiative balance of the Earth—the balance between energy received from the sun and emitted from Earth—that alter climate and weather patterns at global and regional scales.
Multiple lines of evidence confirm that human activities are the primary cause of the global warming of the past 50 years.1 Natural factors, such as variations in the sun's output, volcanic activity, the Earth's orbit, the carbon cycle, and others, also affect Earth's radiative balance. However, beginning in the late 1700s, the net global effect of human activities has been a continual increase in greenhouse gas concentrations.
This change in concentrations causes warming and is affecting various aspects of climate, including surface air and ocean temperatures, precipitation, and sea levels. Human health, agriculture, water resources, forests, wildlife, and coastal areas are all vulnerable to climate change.
Many greenhouse gases are extremely long-lived in the atmosphere, with some remaining airborne for tens to hundreds of years after being released. These long-lived greenhouse gases become globally mixed in the atmosphere and their concentrations reflect past and recent contributions from emissions sources worldwide. Others, like tropospheric ozone, have a relatively short lifetime in the atmosphere.
Other Factors Affecting Climate Change
In addition to greenhouse gases, other related factors, including other radiatively important substances and albedo, can alter the Earth's climate.
- Other radiatively important substances: Certain substances are technically not greenhouse gases due to their physical state, but they nonetheless affect the Earth's energy balance. Some of them, such as sulfate aerosols, have negative radiative forcings that can lead to cooling effects. Others, such as black carbon or soot, contribute to warming.
- Albedo: Albedo is the amount of solar radiation reflected from an object or surface—the Earth's surface, in this case. Natural and human factors can affect albedo on a global scale (through changes in large-scale features like the polar ice sheets) or on a local or regional scale (e.g., by increased amounts of dark paved surfaces that absorb energy versus light paved surfaces that reflect energy).
Although this ROE question does not address radiatively important substances or albedo, both factors are important to understanding the planet's energy balance and the ways human activities may affect that balance.2
Greenhouse Gases and Their Sources
Some greenhouse gases are emitted exclusively from human activities (e.g., synthetic halocarbons). Others occur naturally but are found at elevated levels due to human inputs (e.g., carbon dioxide). Anthropogenic sources result from energy-related activities (e.g., combustion of fossil fuels in the electric utility and transportation sectors), agriculture, land-use change, waste management and treatment activities, and various industrial processes. Major greenhouse gases include carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and various synthetic chemicals.
- Carbon dioxide is widely reported as the most important anthropogenic greenhouse gas because it currently accounts for the greatest portion of the warming associated with human activities. Carbon dioxide occurs naturally as part of the global carbon cycle, but human activities have increased atmospheric loadings through combustion of fossil fuels and other emissions sources. Natural sinks that remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere (e.g., oceans, plants) help regulate carbon dioxide concentrations, but human activities can disturb these processes (e.g., deforestation) or enhance them.
- Methane comes from many sources, including human activities such as coal mining, natural gas production and distribution, waste decomposition in landfills, and digestive processes in livestock and agriculture. Natural sources of methane include wetlands and termite mounds.
- Nitrous oxide is emitted during agricultural and industrial activities, as well as during combustion of solid waste and fossil fuels.
- Various synthetic chemicals, such as hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, sulfur hexafluoride, and other synthetic gases, are released as a result of commercial, industrial, or household uses.
- Many other gases are known to trap heat in the atmosphere. Examples include water vapor, which occurs naturally as part of the global water cycle, and ozone, which occurs naturally in the stratosphere and is found in the troposphere largely due to human activities.
Each greenhouse gas has a different ability to absorb heat in the atmosphere, due to differences in the amount and type of energy that it absorbs, and a different “lifetime,” or time that it remains in the atmosphere.
For example, it would take thousands of molecules of carbon dioxide to equal the warming effect of a single molecule of sulfur hexafluoride—the most potent greenhouse gas—in terms of ability to absorb heat, as evaluated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).3 To facilitate comparisons between gases that have substantially different properties, the IPCC has developed a set of metrics called “global warming potentials.”

Impacts of Climate Change
The changing climate affects society and ecosystems in a variety of ways. For instance:
- A warmer climate is expected to both increase the risk of heat-related illnesses and deaths and increase certain types of air pollution.
- More severe heat waves, floods, and droughts are expected in a warmer climate. These may reduce crop yields.
- Sea level rise could erode and inundate coastal ecosystems and eliminate wetlands.
- Climate change can alter where species live and how they interact, which could fundamentally transform current ecosystems.
These and other aspects of climate change are disrupting people's lives and damaging some sectors of the U.S. economy.4 This has led many state and local governments to prepare for these impacts through “adaptation” (i.e., planning for the changes that are expected to occur).
ROE Indicators
The ROE presents six indicators showing trends in greenhouse gas emissions and their associated environmental impacts: Greenhouse Gas Emissions, Greenhouse Gas Concentrations, Energy Use, Temperature and Precipitation, Sea Level, and Sea Surface Temperature.
- Emissions. For several greenhouse gases, the nation's estimated combined emissions that are directly attributable to human activity have increased 7 percent between 1990 and 2014. Fossil fuel combustion is the country's major source of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions.
- Concentrations. Data on atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases have exceptionally long historical records, with data for some gases spanning several hundred thousand years. For carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, the historical context provided by ice cores shows that present atmospheric concentrations are unprecedented over the last 800,000 years, and demonstrate that the recently increasing levels reflect the influence of human activity.
- Impacts. The indicators present compelling evidence that many fundamental measures of climate in the United States are changing. Average temperatures across the contiguous 48 states have increased since 1901, with an increased rate of warming since the late 1970s. Total annual precipitation has increased in the United States and over land areas worldwide. Since 1901, total precipitation in the contiguous 48 states has increased at an average rate of 0.17 inches per decade. Ocean surface temperatures increased around the world during the 20th century and the average surface temperatures during the past three decades have been higher than at any other time since widespread measurement began in the late 1800s.
Finally, when averaged over all the world's oceans, sea level has increased at a rate of roughly six-tenths of an inch per decade since 1880, and the rate of increase has accelerated in recent years to more than an inch per decade. Information and compelling evidence on a much broader range of climate change impacts can be found in EPA's Climate Change Indicators in the United States and the scientific literature.
There are a few limitations associated with the ROE greenhouse gas indicators.
- Emissions. The emissions trends are based largely on estimates, which have uncertainties inherent in the underlying engineering calculations and estimation methodologies. Uncertainty in emissions estimates varies among the gases and sources, though estimated emissions from some of the largest sources (e.g., carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel combustion) are considered highly accurate.5
One gap in the emissions indicator is that EPA's greenhouse gas inventory does not track every greenhouse gas or every emissions source. Examples of greenhouse gases not included in the inventory are ozone and selected chlorofluorocarbons. The most notable sources not tracked in the inventory are natural sources, such as methane from wetlands, carbon dioxide and methane from thawing permafrost, and multiple emissions from volcanoes.
- Concentrations. While the concentration data thoroughly characterize trends for carbon dioxide (the most important anthropogenic greenhouse gas) and other extensively studied gases, comprehensive global data are not available for other radiatively important substances, such as soot and aerosols. Though these substances technically are not greenhouse gases, tracking trends in these substances' concentrations is important due to their ability to alter the Earth's energy balance.
- Impacts. The changing climate can affect society and ecosystems in many ways. For example, climate change can alter the likelihood of extreme weather events, influence agricultural crop yields, affect human health, cause changes to forests and other ecosystems, and even impact energy supplies. ROE indicators were developed for a few climate measures that are most directly linked to greenhouse gas emissions and concentrations and that have particularly long and abundant records. Information on a much broader range of climate change impacts can be found in EPA's Climate Change Indicators in the United States and the scientific literature.

greencoast,https://greencoast.org/human-environmental-interaction/ ,"In order to understand our ecosystem and environment, we need to know how we (as humans) interact with it. This is an important component of our sustainable future. Here is how human-environmental interaction works.
How Human-Environmental Interaction Works
Although human-environment interactions are beneficial for humans, it is not possible to ignore their far-reaching impacts on the environment. One of these several consequences is climate change, which serves as a serious threat to humans as well as the environment.
As a result, the temperature of the earth is increasing at a fast pace. In fact, there is a potential threat that various coastal areas would submerge due to rising sea level. Unbridled use of fossil fuels and cutting down of the forests have caused irreparable damage to the atmosphere.
Want to know more about sustainability? Read our in-depth guide to sustainability.
The prevailing crisis of climate change relates to human-environment interactions. However, to understand this concept, we need to dig deep into what the term human-environment interaction means. Going green helps the environment. It’s as simple as that.
Human-Environment Interaction Definition
Human-environment interaction relates to a phenomenon, which explains how humans interact with the environment to fulfill their needs and how the environment responds to these interactions. Moreover, it also describes how humans have adapted to their environment for their survival.
Since geography shares a close relationship with humans and the environment, it is essential to discuss it for a better understanding of the human-environment interactions. There are five themes of geography, which include place, location, movement, human-environment interaction, and region.
- Location- As the name suggests, location relates to the geographical position of a specific place on the earth. Latitude and longitude are the essential parameters to locate a place
- Place- On the contrary, the term place discloses the physical specifications of a region such as wet, dry, hot or cold
- Movement- The concept of movement relates to the transportation and immigration patterns in a particular region
- Region- The region, on the other hand, specifies an area showing identical characteristics
A comprehensive discussion regarding the concept of human-environment interaction and its consequences are mentioned below.
3 Ways Humans Interact With The Environment
Human-environment interactions are of different types. People use these interactions as a way to adapt to the environment as well as modify it.
Given below are 3 basic types of human-environment interaction.
- Humans try to modify the environment (positively or negatively), such as cutting forests, building dams, and extending urban areas
- The way humans adapt to the environment to meet their needs
- The way humans depend on the environment for food, timber, water, and other resources
By Modifying The Environment
In order to fulfill their needs, humans modify the environment. It allows them to extract and utilize the resources with less effort.
Some of these modifications include:
- Cutting down the forests to increase agricultural land and grow more food
- Construction of dams to store water and avoid floods
- Drilling of the holes in the ground for the purpose of extracting oil or other natural resources
By Adapting To The Environment
There are a few environmental conditions, which humans can’t modify. Hence, they adapt to such conditions for their survival.
Some of these adaptations include:
- Taking benefit of the natural slope of the land for irrigation
- Building houses on higher ground to avoid flood
- Wearing warm clothes to survive in cold climate
By Depending On The Environment
In order to obtain the essential resources for their survival, humans depend on the environment. Food, drinking water, fiber for clothing, timber, coal and natural gas are some of the major resources.
Humans also utilize different aspects of the environment to develop their civilization.
Human-Environment Interaction Examples
Here are some of the examples of human-environment interaction.
Using Natural Resources
Humans utilize numerous natural resources like oil, gas, wood, metals, and rocks to meet their needs. These resources help them to survive and make it easy for them to live in various conditions. Humans strive for food and water, which serves as one of the largest human-environment interactions.
In addition, people also need energy for various purposes including industrial as well as domestic. For instance, construction of buildings, electronic devices, transport services, and other necessary elements of our social life need energy.
As the population of the world continues to grow, the demand for these natural resources is also soaring. Moreover, socio-economic development also increases the utilization of available resources.
To meet their needs, humans have been continuously extracting these non-renewable resources at an alarming rate.
Deforestation At Large Scale
This is one of the largest negative impacts of human-environment interaction. It would not be wrong to consider it as the unprecedented misuse of natural resources. Humans not only cut down trees at large scale, but they also don’t bother to replant trees or allow them to grow back.
For instance, countries like America, Ethiopia, Brazil, India, and Congo, destroyed a major portion of their forests. The obvious reason for this brutal act is to get wood for economical purposes and increase the land for agricultural.
Deforestation casts drastic impacts on the environment. Forest is home to a variety of plant and animal species. By cutting down trees, we are actually depriving these species of their home. A wide range of animals and plants are at the verge of their extinction, but we are doing no good except continuing our activities.
Apart from this, turning forests into agricultural land minimizes biodiversity. This aspect of the environment is equally beneficial for humans as well as the ecosystem. Trees serve the purpose of purifying the air we breathe and regulate the temperature to make us comfortable while living in otherwise harsh weather conditions.
Soil erosion is another problem associated with deforestation. Trees act as a binding agent for the soil. On the contrary, deforestation exposes soil to unfavorable weather conditions like heavy rain and storm.
As a result, soil erosion starts to begin, leaving our water channels filled with mud and debris.
Utilization Of Resources
How humans utilize renewable or non-renewable sources is another factor that relates to human-environmental interaction. In most cases, humans use these resources to generate energy. For instance, we use energy for our homes, industries, transportation system, and to extract more resources.
Fossil fuels are non-renewable energy resources, yet we have been using them continuously without considering their depletion. Humans have taken these resources for granted and never tried to look for other resources that are renewable as well as environment-friendly.
Apart from the fact that these resources are close to their depletion, there is another issue, which requires immediate attention. The burning of fossil fuels is a great contributory of climate change. Humans are destroying the environment by increasing the number of carbon footprints in the atmosphere.
Although there is no shortage of renewable energy resources, humans have not devised strategies to make good use of these resources. We can use them as a better alternative to fossil fuels. Renewable energy options such as solar/wind power and hydroelectricity are viable in terms of both the cost as well as their zero impact over the environment.
These are some of the best solar panels to use.

Use Of Water Resources
This is a significant element of human-environmental interaction. Humans can’t survive without water. Apart from being a lifesaver, water also offers numerous other benefits. It is essential for various domestic, agricultural and industrial operations.
Despite technological advancements, we are still using conventional irrigation techniques to water our agricultural land. In fact, agriculture utilizes a massive amount of water. To meet such high demands, we build dams to preserve the water. This results in saltification of the soil close to the seas and destruction of the cultivable land.
Recycling is a viable method of replenishing the underground water level. However, the rate of depletion is much higher as compared to recycling. By utilizing huge quantities of water for domestic and industrial purposes, we are actually disturbing the natural water cycle and level of underground water.
Clean and abundant drinking water, fertile soil, and favorable temperatures are some of the characteristics of the environment, which assists humans to survive and prosper.
On the contrary, a harsh condition such as scorching weather, barren land, and lack of water make it difficult for humans to survive. Water is renewable to a certain extent. We need to find ways to better use it and preserve it, however. Also, avoid using bottled water to save on plastic.
Human Activities
Humans start their interaction with the environment shortly after getting birth. Each childbirth puts pressure on the food cycle. We need more food to feed our people and utilize more resources for our survival. We need to build new structures to provide shelter and improve our sustainability.
Hence, humans continue to modify the environment for their own survival. On the contrary, the environment also casts its negative impact on our lives. Climate change has caused damage to our agricultural land. Unexpected weather makes it difficult for us to perform our day to day activities.
Natural calamities like floods, drought, wildfires, earthquakes, and tsunamis are a few examples of nature’s revenge. These adversities of environmental phenomenon cause large scale migrations and death of people.
All these are the side effects of the activities that humans continue to practice without taking into account their consequences. Humans modify the environment to draw maximum benefit out of it and meet their needs. This disturbs the natural balance of our ecosystem and causes the destruction of the environment around us.
Drilling For Oil, Gas And Other Natural Resources
Humans drill the land to extract oil and gas, which serve as a major source to produce energy. However, this act of drilling and extraction of natural resources leave a negative impact on the environment.
Drilling, for instance, makes the soil more prone to earthquakes by lowering its strength. Moreover, oil spills have their own effect on the environment. Incidents like these can destroy marine life.
In addition, the vegetation around shores also experiences the negative impacts of oil spills.
Use Of Different Means Of Transportation
Humans have been inventing things to make their lives more comfortable. The revolution in the field of transportation has enabled people to travel faster and cover longer distances. Besides the benefits of using different means of transportation, there are certain drawbacks too.
Cars, buses, and airplanes are the major contributors to the devastation humans have caused to the environment. These transportation facilities are responsible for more than one-third of the overall greenhouse gas emissions. The air pollution, which is a result of such emissions, has been causing the spread of various fatal diseases.
Dumping And Littering
Dumping of waste materials into rivers, at seashores and close to vegetation is a serious threat to marine life and animals living on the land. Besides, dumping and littering add harmful elements to the air that we breathe. Hence, we are not affecting the environment only, but also putting our own lives at risk.
Litter also interferes with the flow of water, causing river tributaries to flood the surrounding area. Especially, improper dumping of plastic materials serves as a continuous menace for the close by inhabitants.
Dumping also destroys the natural landscape. It pollutes the air, water, and land, making it difficult for humans and other living creatures to survive. The heaps of dumped waste material serve as a breeding site for various harmful bacteria and virus, spreading the epidemic diseases in the surrounding areas.
Graffiti And Aerosols
Another instance of human-environment interaction that affects the environment in a negative sense is the use of aerosols and graffiti. These chemicals are harmful to the environment. The fumes coming out of aerosols increase the number of greenhouse gases, thus promote global warming.
In addition, the latest CFC-free aerosol sprays are not safe to use, as they emit volatile organic compounds. These compounds have a tendency to dissolve the ozone levels. These chemicals are also dangerous to inhale since they cause asthma in humans when exposed for longer periods.
Conclusion on Human-Environment Interaction
Nature has provided for us a sustainable and favorable environment for humans. However, humans have destroyed the perfect balance of our ecosystem by mercilessly utilizing the resources around them. Although human-environment interactions are inevitable for co-existence, maintaining a suitable balance is the key to survival.
Our environment allows us to make certain modifications for our survival, but misusing this opportunity results in the destruction at a large scale. Humans have made significant changes to the environment in a way that suits them. However, they didn’t consider the consequences of such modifications.
Hence, humans are responsible for the current devastation of our environment. We are now facing the challenge of climate change, which puts the future of our next generations at risk.
What are some other ways of human-environmental interaction? Please let us know in the comments below. We’d love to hear from you.

weforum,https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/01/5-reasons-why-the-economy-is-failing-the-environment-and-humanity/ ,"The world has entered the Anthropocene. We are today a ""big world on a small planet"" where the economy exerts phenomenal pressure on Earth. There is no free natural capital left. All remaining biodiversity, freshwater, atmosphere, coral reefs, oceans, forests and ice sheets play a direct role in regulating the stability of Earth and thereby the economy.
The trouble is, our economic system was developed, from Adam Smith to Keynes, when we were still a ""small world on a big planet"". When there were no frontiers and the idea of the global economy affecting the planet was seen as ridiculous. We could emit greenhouse gases for free, empty oceans for free, pollute polar regions for free, without risking invoices being sent back from Earth.
This is no longer the case. In the 1980s the first invoices started coming back – the ozone hole, collapse of fisheries, tipping points in freshwater lakes, accelerated ice melt, shifts in heatwaves and storm patterns. And, as geopolitical fuel, the polluters are seldom the victims.
Here are five ways the economy is failing people and the planet.
The tragedy of the commons
Despite recognition by many economists, the economy remains frustratingly locked in the tragedy of the commons. Economic growth comes with unaccounted environmental costs and with it, rising risks of catastrophe. The economy remains unable to internalize real Earth costs.
Today, the number one economic threat to humanity is our inability to value nature.
This is not only about monetization. Sure, valuing natural capital and ecosystem services is critical. A global price on carbon is necessary. But it is - as science and myriad attempts have shown, not easy and not always possible (particularly to get the right price). So, valuing nature also means that we have to accept leaving the realm of economics. We enter the realm of ethics, inclusiveness and justice.
The Fourth Industrial Revolution can only succeed on a stable and resilient planet. We need to set planetary boundaries for world economic development. This requires political leadership. The markets cannot do it alone.
From linear thinking to non-linear reality - why discount rates do not work
Science clearly shows that human pressures on the environment follow a resilience path. When environmental resilience is high, change is slow, linear and incremental. Economies can exploit the environment with seemingly no or limited impacts. This is possible when we have abundant biodiversity, redundant atmosphere and glacial capacity to absorb greenhouse gases and pollution. When resilience has been drained following long periods of linear change, the environment can abruptly shift. Tipping points are crossed, triggering large system shifts, often irreversible, potentially catastrophic.
When costs for society go from predictable to non-predictable, from manageable to potentially infinitely dangerous, then we can no longer use market based discount rates to assess where it is most cost-effective to place our investments. In essence this means that in a non-linear world - where Earth sends invoices - the conventional economic theory falls apart.
Linear economic models do not work on a finite planet
Our economic system builds on linear principles focused on throughput, optimization and cost-benefit efficiency. We exploit, create value, and then waste.
There is no such thing as a Fourth Industrial Revolution with 9 billion thriving co-citizens in the world, if it is accomplished on linear economic principles. We need a transition to circular economic principles and practice.
The current economic model benefits the few at the expense of the many
There is an old belief that solving environmental problems can only be achieved by first building enough economic wealth, so we can ""afford to save the environment"". This ""Kuznets Curve"" thinking has never been correct and must be abandoned once and for all if we are serious about economic development for a thriving humanity on Earth.
The cynical truth is that it is only ""thanks"" to poverty that we do not have very dangerous climate change already. People in low income nations are responsible for far less emissions every year.
Moreover, economic growth - as shown by Piketty and others, does not trickle down to the poor. An inequity aggravated by the fact that the economic wealth in the world so far is accomplished through unsustainable subsidies from the planet, while the cost for these subsidies are largely taken up by others, in general to poorest communities.
Cost-benefit analyses no longer work for natural capital
And much less so for the stability and resilience of planet Earth. We are unable in our current economic system to incorporate long-term risk and value. We may, already when transgressing 2C, trigger the irreversible melting of the Greenland ice sheet. Not over decades but over centuries. This would subject future generations to a rise in sea level of 7-metres. Clearly, an unacceptable future. Still, the economy is unable to place any value whatsoever to long-term infinite and existential global risk.
Under stable and incremental conditions, a free market economy spurs entrepreneurship, ensures efficiency and generates wealth. Those conditions no longer apply.
Global risks are too high, and the benefits of transitioning to global sustainable development are not recognised. We are failing to create the right incentives on the market. Unsustainable behaviour still gives the highest returns.
Global sustainability is now the only avenue to future inclusive progress that can deliver the Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris climate agreement. To succeed, we need to set planetary boundaries to create a safe operating space on Earth for the world economy – that is, confining the Fourth Industrial Revolution within social and environmental boundaries. This is not a way of grinding the revolution to a halt. It is instead a way of spurring deeper innovation and step-changes to a healthy, thriving global economy.

greenpeace,https://www.greenpeace.org/usa/issues/environmental-justice/ ,"Environmental Justice
From direct actions that shape our future to investigations that result in incredible environmental wins to large-scale mobilizations that inspire hundreds of thousands of people, Greenpeace has been making an enormous impact on the global environmental movement since its very first action in 1971. But our journey from 50 years ago to today hasn’t been perfect. Like many large environmental organizations and much like the mainstream environmental movement in the United States, Greenpeace USA has continual work to do to ensure justice is at the core of our campaigns.
What is Environmental Justice?
Environmental Justice is a concept that was coined in the early 1960s during the Civil Rights movement and has increasingly picked up momentum as our social justice movements and environmental issues have grown. The issues of racism and socioeconomic justice are central to the issue of Environmental Justice. At its core, Environmental Justice guarantees that all people have equal access to a healthy, safe, and sustainable environment, as well as equal protection from environmental harm.
Environmental Justice assumes and recognizes community care and Indigenous and first nations’ knowledge. It acknowledges how privilege, power, and oppression are integral to our understanding of how we are impacted by climate change and our environment.
We witness environmental injustice when our single-use plastic is incinerated causing air pollution in low-income communities in the US, or when it is shipped overseas to overwhelm South East Asian communities. We witness environmental injustice in Flint, MI, a majority-black community that still has lead in its water and when state violence harms Indigenous youth fighting to protect their land. These are only a few examples of the impact of environmental injustice that highlight the necessity of centering Environmental Justice in our movement.
Why is justice critical to the future of activism?
As our planet continues to warm, forest fires burn, plastics dump into our oceans, and natural disasters worsen, we are witnessing increases in negative impacts. Our movements must keep pace with the rapid degradation of our natural world as well as our social world, challenging us to understand how climate change and environmental degradation impact humans differently.
We have lifetimes of relearning to do around our notions of community, trauma, and social justice. Racism, patriarchy, militarism, corporate greed, capitalism, state violence — these and other causes of immense harm to those most at risk continue, largely unchecked. When we recognize who is most at risk, we find institutional harm is interwoven with the impact of the climate catastrophe. Understanding this, fighting oppression, and centering those most marginalized help us create an environmentally just future for all. Environmental Justice requires that we incorporate racial and socioeconomic justice into the way we fight for the protection of our planet. Exploring the ways that global warming harms low-income communities, primarily black, brown, Indigenous, and migrant communities are critical to understanding how our fight must be won. Environmental justice challenges us to center the voices of those most impacted by environmental harm in the fight for the protection of our planet. And it’s not just communities of color that are at risk from environmental injustice — those in need of abortion access, food access, LGBTQ2S+ communities, people with disabilities, and people at intersections of multiple oppressions are impacted as well. To protect our natural world and natural resources, we need to fight for justice for all people and leave no one behind. This means recognizing the unique challenges faced by our most marginalized communities and taking leadership from them; those experiencing injustice know what they need. For centuries, Indigenous communities have learned and taught about ways we must protect our land and seas. When we give agency and power back to people-centered communities, we empower the change that our world and our future needs. It is time to take initiative and acknowledge the harm that environmental movements have caused and do the work required for a just future. At Greenpeace, we know that Environmental Justice is the centerpiece for our movements and that the work we do must be rooted in it as an ongoing practice. Building a greener and more peaceful world for all requires a diverse, multicultural, people-powered force that centers the most impacted and marginalized, to ensure no one gets left behind. This is the Environmental Justice we strive to achieve.

pachamama,https://www.pachamama.org/environmental-awareness ,"Environmental awareness is to understand the fragility of our environment and the importance of its protection. Promoting environmental awareness is an easy way to become an environmental steward and participate in creating a brighter future for our children.
To define environmental awareness we must first understand the environmentalist movement. Environmentalism is an ideology that evokes the necessity and responsibility of humans to respect, protect, and preserve the natural world from its anthropogenic (caused by humans) afflictions.
Environmental awareness is an integral part of the movement’s success. By teaching our friends and family that the physical environment is fragile and indispensable, we can begin fixing the problems that threaten it.
Before you can begin promoting environmental awareness in your community, you must first make sure that you have a thorough understanding of environmental issues. Stay up to date on environmental news, read books and other resources, and learn about the issues affecting your own community. It’s much easier to talk to others about the environment if you’ve already taken the time to educate yourself.
Numerous resources are available to promote environmental awareness and education: group learning (inside or outside of the classroom), informational and inspirational seminars, online courses, books, articles, videos, and brochures are just a few of the tools that can get you involved in promoting the environment.
A good course of action that ensures your continued participation is to pick an environmental issue that strikes you as the most urgent. The amount of environmental issues seems limitless, and while they are all important, it’s easy to get overwhelmed. Try choosing one issue to focus on at a time. You will soon see that all environmental issues are intertwined and will find your niche of interest.
Here are several cause-and-effect problems that harm our environment:
After you’ve chosen an issue and educated yourself, engage your community, family, and friends in a conversation about the issue’s urgency and importance.
By engaging your community in the conversation, you are not only promoting environmental awareness, but you may also find opportunities to participate in communal projects or to get involved in other related causes.
Once you’re well versed in environmental issues, you can use that knowledge to start beneficial projects in your home and/or in your community.
Once you have chosen your cause and have started a personal or community project, share it with the world! Get your coworkers, neighbors, friends, family, or even your local government involved. It’s much easier and more effective to spread environmental awareness and start a local project if you collaborate with others in your community.
Promoting environmental awareness is a crucial part of being an environmental steward. Start participating in the change and teach your community what is needed to create a sustainable future. . ",False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False

owlcation,https://owlcation.com/stem/The-EPAs-4-Major-Environmental-Concerns ,"The 4 Major Environmental Issues and Concerns of the EPA
Kathryn is a concerned environmentalist who hopes to shed light on some of the issues facing our planet, our people, and our environment.
If someone asked you what the biggest threats facing our environment are today, what would you answer? The question is overwhelming because there are so many different aspects of the environment that are being impacted simultaneously.
Environmental Threat Categories Outlined by the EPA
Overpopulation, deforestation, and a host of other problems could ultimately lead to the devastation of the natural environment. This concern impacts all of the people living on this planet. To help make sense of a problem of this magnitude and complexity, the EPA has broken down its environmental concerns into four major areas so that people who are interested in making changes can understand how to best focus their efforts. Each of these four areas of environmental concern is comprised of many different components, but a basic understanding of each of them will help you familiarize yourself with some of the major issues that this planet faces today.
The EPA's 4 Major Environmental Concerns
- Water Issues
- Air Issues
- Waste and Land Pollution
- Climate Change
1. Water Issues
One of the most important areas of environmental concern is the earth's water supply. We need to be concerned about water pollution as well as the increasing scarcity of drinkable water in certain areas of the world.
People who are concerned about this issue should start helping out by reducing their water waste as much as possible. This can be approached by analyzing your water use at home. Make an effort to minimize water used during showers, cooking, tooth-brushing, and restroom visits.
What Can You Do?
- Collect rainwater for re-use.
- Set up a natural landscape that doesn’t require water for your plants.
- Join a local organization to assist in fighting water pollution around the world.
2. Air Issues
Air pollution isn’t an issue that most people consider to be of primary environmental concern since it doesn’t seem to pose an immediate or pressing threat to a lot of us. However, air pollution causes serious health problems and threatens the natural environment. This means that it is actually one of the most important areas of environmental concern that we can start working to change today.
What Can You Do?
- Minimize your use of cars and other vehicles in favor of walking or riding a bike.
- Be conscious of your use of air-polluting chemicals.
- Reduce your engagement with air-polluting services like dry-cleaning.
- Limit your consumption of products that come from air-polluting factories.
3. Waste and Land Pollution
Another area of grave concern to the EPA that impacts many different aspects of the planet's health is waste. Toxic waste like dangerous electronics and harmful chemicals are deposited in landfills on a large-scale basis. Toxic waste is a major issue, but other types of waste are of concern as well. All waste ends up leading to land pollution, causing problems in the environment and taking up much-needed land space.
A lot of items that can be recycled or donated still get thrown away because it’s more convenient for people to toss stuff in the trash. Those who analyze their waste habits are often able to make simple changes in order to minimize the amount of material they discard.
What Can You Do?
- Get in the habit of buying only what you need.
- Recycle all recyclable items instead of throwing them away.
- Re-use or donate all useful, non-recyclable items instead of throwing them away.
4. Climate Change
All of these different types of pollution and waste end up contributing to what is probably the biggest area of concern for the planet—the changing climate. Climate change is a major environmental concern because of the fact that even small changes can cause significant problems for large portions of the world.
Climate change is causing increase in the severity of natural disasters like floods and hurricanes worldwide. These things devastate society and wreak havoc on the regions that they hit. If it continues at its current rate, global warming will cause an increase in these issues along with additional problems that could ultimately end civilization as we know it.
What Can You Do?
If you work on improving your efforts in the EPA's first three areas of environmental concern, then you will be contributing to the battle against this major threat to our planet's health.
Why Focus on These Four Concerns?
It’s true that there are other types of environmental issues that we might be inclined to focus on when we are fretting about what’s going on with the earth around us. However, if you take a close look at any of those specific concerns, you will see that they usually fall into one of the four major categories outlined by the EPA.
Example Issue: Deforestation
Deforestation is a really serious problem that is causing a lot of environmental issues. This can be viewed through the EPA's waste category—it usually happens as a result of organizations or individuals using too many trees from a single area to build bigger homes, make paper products, or otherwise create wasteful material. Reducing waste by building homes using recycled materials and storing more information digitally could help address this issue.
Get an Environmental Education!
This article only touches on the four major environmental concerns of the EPA. To really be able to make a difference on this planet, it’s important to understand each of these four issues in greater depth. The only way to do that is to get an education in what each of these four areas of concern is really all about. Reading through the EPA’s website is a great place to start your environmental education. After that, you can choose which of the four areas concerns you most and focus your personal efforts on that area to do your own small part to change your planet for the better.

It’s true that there are other types of environmental concerns that we might be inclined to focus on when we are fretting about what’s going on with the earth around us. However, if you take a close look at any of those specific concerns then you will see that they usually fall into one of the other categories as a subcategory within it. For example, deforestation is a really serious problem that is causing a lot of environmental issues. However, it can be considered a problem that is related to waste because it usually happens as a result of the fact that people are using more of the trees than they actually need either for building bigger homes or for making paper products or something like this. Reduction of waste and choosing to only use what we need would reduce this problem. Similarly, a major issue related to deforestation is its relationship to climate change so dealing with the issues surrounding it would help us to deal with the bigger picture of our changing climate.

Really? The EPA? Aren't they the government agency that claimed Co2 to be hazardous to our health, paving the way for major tax increases on everything from Industrial/Energy products/services to exhaling when we are breathing? I'm sorry, but I have to laugh(1cent everytime I exhale, paid to the government based on the average number of exhales in a year). That sounds very silly, but government is getting very desperate due to the amount of debt is has amassed. I tell you, we should not litter and pollute our rivers, nor should we stop using the natural resources that has made this country so great. ""Man-made"" global climate change is just another way for politicians to confiscate your money. It isn't true...one day, this period of ""green"" will be laughed at by our grandchildren. The truth will have to come out one day because there are too many scientists getting fed up with political agendas. Science is about finding the truth behind everything we see, hear, feel and taste...not so much, truth...but the ""why"" of everything.

Is Organic Food Really Better for the Environment?
When you walk into any farmers’ market, you’re greeted with signs that say “Certified Organic” in bold letters. Despite being far more expensive than its non-organic counterparts, organic agriculture has become the most popular type of alternative farming, not only in the United States but also globally.
According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), as of 2012, organic farming accounted for 3 percent of the total sales within the country’s food industry. Even in European countries like Finland, Austria, and Germany, governments have been busy implementing plans and policies that aim to dedicate 20 percent of land area to organic farming. In South Asia, Bhutan has ambitious plans of going 100 percent organic by 2020. Meanwhile, Sikkim, a state in north-eastern India had managed to go 100 percent organic in 2016.
The gradual shift towards organic farming has been mainly because we as consumers have become increasingly concerned about the health impacts of accidentally consuming pesticides and chemical fertilizers. During the 1990s, the USDA first standardized the meaning of the term “organic” — basically, farmers do not use any form of synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides, or fungicides to grow their produce.
Organic farming is widely considered to be a far more sustainable alternative when it comes to food production. The lack of pesticides and wider variety of plants enhances biodiversity and results in better soil quality and reduced pollution from fertilizer or pesticide run-off.
Conventional farming has been heavily criticized for causing biodiversity loss, soil erosion, and increased water pollution due to the rampant usage of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides. However, despite these glaring cons, scientists are concerned that organic farming has far lower yields as compared to conventional farming, and so requires more land to meet demand.
A polarized debate
Not surprisingly, the debate over organic versus conventional farming is heavily polarized in academic circles. Of late, the conversation about organic farming has shifted from its lack of chemicals to its impact on greenhouse gas emissions. In December 2018, researchers from Chalmers University of Technology published a study in the journal Nature that found that organic peas farmed in Sweden have a bigger climate impact (50 percent higher emissions) as compared to peas that were grown conventionally in the country.
“Organic farming has many advantages but it doesn’t solve all the environmental problems associated with producing food. There is a huge downside because of the extra land that is being used to grow organic crops,” said Stefan Wirsenius, an associate professor at Chalmers. “If we use more land for food, we have less land for carbon sequestration. The total greenhouse gas impact from organic farming is higher than conventional farming.”
Soon after the paper was published and widely covered by various news organizations globally, several researchers criticized the study. Andrew Smith, a chief scientist at the Rodale Institute, lashed out in a post saying that it was “irresponsible to extrapolate a global phenomenon based on two crops grown in one country over three years.”
Smith also added that more data should be included and analyzed before making conclusions. Commenting on this, Wirsenius said, “It is true that we had a small comparison between organic versus conventional farming based on Swedish statistics. This is because Sweden is one of the very few countries that has statistics that include the yields from organic and conventional crops.”
“It would have been better with bigger sample size and that is a valid concern,” he added.
It is estimated that by 2050, the demand for food is going to increase by 59 to 98 percent due to the ever-increasing global population. A major challenge for the agriculture business is not only trying to figure out how to feed a growing population, but also doing so while adapting to climate change and coming up with adequate mitigation measures.
Some scientists continue to be concerned that with limited land areas that will be available for farming, it might not be sustainable for industrialized countries to go 100 percent organic. A recent study published in the journal Nature Communications concludes that the widespread adoption of organic farming practices in England and Wales would lead to increases in greenhouse gas emissions. This is mainly because agricultural yields would be 40 percent lower.
The researchers argued that with fewer crops being grown locally, these two countries would have to import more food supplies. However, if England and Wales did not solely rely on organic farming, and both countries’ farmers used this alternative form of farming on a smaller scale, it could result in a 20 percent reduction in carbon emissions.
“For organic farming to be successful, agribusinesses would have to find the balance between the costs involved and also, its carbon footprint, while taking into consideration the overall need to meet the high demands for food,” said Alexander Ruane, a research physical scientist at NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies and an adjunct associate research scientist at the Columbia University Center for Climate Systems Research. “That’s tough because the goal of organic farming in developed countries currently is about meeting the needs of those who can afford the luxury to buy the highest quality food. If the needs of this luxury interfere with the need to feed the entire population, then you have the potential for conflicts.”
The blurry line between “good” and “bad”
Making matters more complicated, some experts worry that the term “organic food” is not always properly regulated. As more large corporations get involved in organic markets, researchers claim that this shift to the mainstream has “led to the weakening of ecologically beneficial standards”. It may also limit organic farming’s ability to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
While researchers and the general public remain divided on whether organic farming is more sustainable than conventional farming, Sonali McDermid, an assistant professor at the department of environmental studies at New York University, says that it is very hard to generalize across any farming systems or label conventional or organic farming as “good” or “bad”. “They have very different manifestations, depending upon where you go,” she said.
“An apt example would be the case of a farm involved in the production of organic berries in Central Valley, California. While they are not using additional land area or chemical inputs like in conventional farming, they are using other really strong inputs like sulfur,” explained McDermid. “This can be harmful to farmworkers as they need to wear proper suits and protective gear even though it is not chemically synthetic. Despite that, it is just as powerful in some cases.”
McDermid is also concerned that some agribusinesses can farm uniformly without any biodiversity and still call themselves organic. Whereas in developing or emerging economies — for example in India — farmers tend to follow a far more traditional definition of organic farming.
“In India, organic farms grow lots of different crops at the same time. They grow plants that can naturally keep pests away and don’t use powerful inputs like sulfur. Instead, the farmers use plants and biodiversity to help regulate their cropping systems,” said McDermid.
Indian farmers who grow organic crops also make their fertilizers by filling a field with legumes that they grow in rotations. Once the legumes have fully grown, the farmers manually plow them into the ground. That results in larger quantities of nitrogen being pumped into the soil, as opposed to only using manure or even worse, synthetic fertilizers.
McDermid said that in some areas of the developing world, organic farming can actually boost yields over conventional farming because it doesn’t rely on so much water and chemical inputs. These practices also build soil fertility and lead to less pollution.
Experts maintain that in the heated debate over organic versus conventional farming, there needs to be more information available for consumers when it comes to labeling and even understanding the certification processes in industrialized countries like the U.S.
“A huge fraction, if not the majority of organic goods sold at supermarkets in the U.S. is probably industrial,” added McDermid. For now, in the developed world, the industrialization or commercialization of organic farming has resulted in a lot of difficulty for both consumers and researchers, who are trying to understand what the goals of this booming industry are.
To eat organic or not to eat organic
In the U.S., even sustainability experts continue to be unsure of whether food items like fruits and vegetables with the “certified organic” labels are in fact, genuinely organic or not. McDermid said that even she sometimes feels uncertain about what to buy in the supermarket.
That being said, both Wirsenius and McDermid agree that it is far more environmentally sustainable to eat organic chicken instead of beef that was produced conventionally. Yet, consuming large portions of organically produced meat will still have a bigger environmental impact than eating conventionally produced crops and fruits.
Taking into consideration the high costs involved in going 100 percent organic, especially when it comes to buying fruits and vegetables, McDermid said if you can afford to spend extra, she would recommend buying them.
It might also help to look for organic food that was grown locally. For instance, several community gardens grow organic vegetables that are sold in nearby farmers’ markets.
Keeping that in mind, there’s no need to feel guilty or under pressure to spend extra for organic produce. “I would never put that kind of pressure on anybody. It’s really unfortunate we’re in a situation where agribusinesses focus only on yields, which makes an alternative form of farming comparatively much more expensive,” sighed McDermid.
While the organic versus conventional farming debate rages on, there is one clear way to lower the environmental impact of your food, and it won’t hurt your wallet: reducing the amount of meat in your diet. . ",False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False

livescience,https://www.livescience.com/27862-china-environmental-problems.html https://www.livescience.com/ ,"China's environmental crises seem to arise on a scale as sweeping and epic as the vast nation itself:
Thousands of dead, bloated pigs floating down the river that supplies Shanghai with its drinking water. Air pollution in Beijing so impenetrable the U.S. Embassy's air quality measuring station can only call it ""beyond index."" Industrial towns where rates of cancer are so high they're known as ""cancer villages.""
Compounding these problems is the Chinese government's stony silence about anything that might imperil the country's economic development — including environmental regulation.
But China's increasingly restive population of 1.3 billion people is now starting to demand government action to combat the deadly plagues of pollution and disease that are stalking the 21st century's economic powerhouse. [The 10 Most Polluted Places on Earth]
Chinese officials, however, have barely started to acknowledge the problem. In the meantime, the people of China are forced to face the following environmental catastrophes on a daily basis:
Air pollution
According to the Environmental Protection Agency's air quality scale, any pollution rating above 300 means the air is unsafe to breathe. Under these conditions, people should stay indoors with an air purifier running and remain as motionless as possible, according to U.S. Embassy Beijing guidelines.
In January alone, there were 19 days when the index in Beijing surpassed that 300 threshold, according to the Washington Post, and readings above 500 are no longer unusual. On Jan. 12, the reading reached an eye-bleeding 886, comparable to living inside a smoking lounge.
Manufacturing industries and Beijing's 5 million-plus cars all contribute to the city's crippling air pollution, but most experts primarily blame the coal-burning electrical plants that power China's breakneck economic growth.
China now burns 47 percent of the world's coal, roughly equal to the amount used by all other countries of the world combined, the New York Times reports. And Beijing is surrounded by a vast network of coal-burning power plants.
But as foul as it is, Beijing's air isn't even China's worst: That dubious honor goes to Ürümqi in the country's far west, which frequently joins other Chinese cities like Lanzhou and Linfen on lists of the world's most polluted places. [Top 10 Ways to Destroy Earth]
Water pollution
Thousands of dead pigs floating past Shanghai, dramatic though they are, may be the least of China's water pollution worries.
In January, a chemical accident leaked benzene, a known cancer-causing agent, into a tributary of the Huangpu River (where the dead pigs were discovered). More than 20 people were hospitalized as a result, according to the Wall Street Journal, and area residents were forced to rely on fire trucks to deliver safe drinking water.
More than half of China's surface water is so polluted it cannot be treated to make it drinkable, the Economist reports, and one-quarter of it is so dangerous it can't even be used for industrial purposes.
Groundwater isn't any safer: About 40 percent of China's farmland relies on underground water for irrigation, and an estimated 90 percent is polluted, Reuters reports. About 60 percent of the groundwater beneath Chinese cities is described as ""severely polluted"" by the Economist.
Last December — shortly after his sister died of lung cancer at age 35 — businessman Jin Zengmin from Zhejiang province offered a 200,000-yuan ($32,000) reward to any local environmental official who would swim in a nearby river, where Jin once swam as a boy, Time.com reports. The river is now black with sludge from an upstream shoe factory.
His reward remains uncollected.
Desertification
China has a history of intensive agriculture going back millennia, so it's perhaps unsurprising that much of the nation's 3.7 million square-mile (9.6 million square kilometers) territory has been subject to deforestation.
Population pressure, the conversion of forests to farmland, and hydroelectric and other infrastructure projects have placed China's remaining forests at risk. This prompted the United Nations Environment Programme to list the country's forests as threatened and in need of protection.
Following closely on the heels of deforestation and agricultural development is desertification, the destruction of vegetative land cover that results in a landscape defined by bare soil and rock. About 1 million square miles (2.6 million sq km) of China is now under desertification — that's about one-quarter of the country’s total land surface, spread across 18 provinces, according to IPS News Agency.
Blinding dust storms, mud-choked rivers and eroded topsoil are often the result of desertification. Despite recent gains in reforestation and grasslands restoration, the desert continues to expand each year by about 950 square miles (2,460 sq km), according to the World Wildlife Fund (WWF). [Dry and Drying: Stark Images of Drought]
The resulting loss of arable land has created a generation of ""eco-migrants,"" the Guardian reports, who are forced to leave their homelands, because their traditional agricultural lifestyle is no longer an option.
""We've made progress, but we face a daunting challenge,"" Liu Tuo, Chinese desertification control officer, told the Guardian. ""It may take China 300 years.""
Biodiversity
Closely related to deforestation and desertification is the issue of habitat loss and the resulting drop in biodiversity. As vast areas of forest are cleared for farmland, bamboo plantations, timber and fuel wood, endangered animals like pandas struggle to survive.
China's issues with species loss extend far beyond its borders: The slaughter of elephants for ivory, the killing of rhinos for their horns, and the culling of tigers for their bones (as medicine) and penises (as aphrodisiacs) have one primary source: the Chinese market.
Sharks are endangered worldwide, largely because of shark finning — the removal of dorsal fins from still-living sharks — for the Chinese delicacy known as shark fin soup.
Cancer villages
Perhaps no other issue underscores China's reckless disregard for environmental and public health more than the existence of ""cancer villages,"" entire towns that have been written off as so polluted that simply living there is a cancer risk.
For years, individuals and groups have waged a desperate campaign to force the government to address — or even acknowledge — the high rates of stomach, liver, kidney and colon cancer in certain areas, usually adjacent to heavy industrial complexes, the BBC reports.
In Shangba, a city in southern Guangdong province, the river that flows through town changes from white to a startling shade of orange because of varying types of industrial effluent, Reuters reports. Many of the river's contaminants, like cadmium and zinc, are known to cause cancer.
""All the fish died, even chickens and ducks that drank from the river died. If you put your leg in the water, you'll get rashes and a terrible itch,"" He Shuncai, a 34-year-old farmer from Shangba, told Reuters. ""Last year alone, six people in our village died from cancer and they were in their 30s and 40s.""
In February of this year, a report from China's environment ministry noted that chemicals and heavy metals banned in other countries are found throughout China. The report went on to state that there are ""some serious cases of health and social problems like the emergence of cancer villages in individual regions,"" marking the first official admission of the problem that has plagued the country for decades.
Population growth
China's ""one-child"" policy is universally acknowledged as having effectively kept the country's population in check. Nonetheless, China is home to about 1.3 billion people — over one-seventh of the planet's people live in the nation.
What's more of a concern to environmental advocates is the growing affluence of China's middle class, who are now adopting Western-style consumer patterns. While items like red meat, liquor and automobiles were once considered forbidden luxuries, more and more families are driving their car to a market to buy tenderloin beef, 120-proof baijiu liquor and other consumer goods.
The health risks associated with these kinds of purchases have not gone unnoticed: Binge drinking and alcohol-related hospitalizations have now reached ""epidemic proportions,"" the Guardian reports, and the Chinese — who once enjoyed a relatively healthy diet and low rates of cancer — now dine on twice as much meat as Americans, consuming one-quarter of the world's supply, according to the Telegraph.
These consumer trends, multiplied across a large and heavily populated country, have a global reach that affects everything from sugar prices in Europe to climate change in Greenland: Most climate experts agree that China's industrial growth, and its dependence on coal-burning, are significant drivers of climate change, Scientific American reports.
Can China change course?
While China's traditionally obdurate government hierarchy has seemed to value economic development at any cost, including the health of its citizens and wholesale eco-destruction, there are signs of a thaw in the icy silence that shrouds much environmental action in the country.
The government's recent admission that cancer villages exist ""shows that the environment ministry has acknowledged that pollution has led to people getting cancer,"" environmental lawyer Wang Canfa told Agence Frence-Presse. ""It shows that this issue, of environmental pollution leading to health damages, has drawn attention.""
Coupled with the public outcry over the thick blanket of toxic smog that covered Beijing earlier this year, there are glimmers of hope that the Chinese people may succeed in wresting some measure of control over their environment — and their lives — back from government and industry leaders.
Whether they will succeed remains to be seen.

mit,https://web.mit.edu/12.000/www/m2016/finalwebsite/problems/mining.html ,"Overview
Unregulated mining has the potential to release harmful substances into the soil, air, and water. Mission 2016 proposes that governments enforce regulations on companies and use cutting-edge technology to reduce the damage from mining-related sources. As more mines open in countries with varying levels of environmental protection, it is increasingly vital that safeguards established by the Strategic Minerals Association (SMA) are in place before operations proceed (see the international regulation page).
Environmental Damages of Mining
Open pit mining
Open pit mining, where material is excavated from an open pit, is one of the most common forms of mining for strategic minerals. This type of mining is particularly damaging to the environment because strategic minerals are often only available in small concentrations, which increases the amount of ore needed to be mined.
Environmental hazards are present during every step of the open-pit mining process. Hardrock mining exposes rock that has lain unexposed for geological eras. When crushed, these rocks expose radioactive elements, asbestos-like minerals, and metallic dust. During separation, residual rock slurries, which are mixtures of pulverized rock and liquid, are produced as tailings, toxic and radioactive elements from these liquids can leak into bedrock if not properly contained.
Underground Mining
Underground mining has the potential for tunnel collapses and land subsidence (Betournay, 2011). It involves large-scale movements of waste rock and vegetation, similar to open pit mining. Additionally, like most traditional forms of mining, underground mining can release toxic compounds into the air and water. As water takes on harmful concentrations of minerals and heavy metals, it becomes a contaminant. This contaminated water can pollute the region surrounding the mine and beyond (Miranda, Blanco-Uribe Q., Hernandez, Ochoa G., & Yerena, 1998). Mercury is commonly used in as an amalgamating agent to facilitate the recovery of some precious ores (Miranda et al., 1998). Mercury tailings then become a major source of concern, and improper disposal can lead to contamination of the atmosphere and neighboring bodies of water. Most underground mining operations increase sedimentation in nearby rivers through their use of hydraulic pumps and suction dredges; blasting with hydraulic pumps removes ecologically valuable topsoil containing seed banks, making it difficult for vegetation to recover (Miranda et al., 1998). Deforestation due to mining leads to the disintegration of biomes and contributes to the effects of erosion.
In situ leach (ISL) mining
ISL mining has environmental and safety advantages over conventional mining in that the ore body is dissolved and then pumped out, leaving minimal surface disturbance and no tailings or waste rock (World Nuclear Association, 2012). There is no ore dust or direct ore exposure to the environment and a lower consumption of water is needed in the mining process (International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], 2005). However, the strong acids used to dissolve the ore body commonly dissolve metals in the host rock as well. The fluids remaining after the leaching process commonly contain elevated concentrations of metals and radioactive isotopes, posing a significant risk to nearby ground and surface water sources (IAEA, 2005). Additionally, the low pH of ISL mining wastewater can result in acidification of the surrounding environment.
Heap Leaching
Environmental issues with heap leaching are centered on the failure to keep process solutions within the heap leaching circuit. Release of toxic heap leaching fluids into the environment can affect the health of both the surrounding ecosystem and human population (Reichardt, 2008). Water balance is crucial in heap leaching projects because of the possibility of the overflow of solutions containing toxic concentrations of heavy metals after a heavy rainfall or rapid snowmelt (Norman & Raforth, 1994). In some cases cyanide is used to extract metals from oxidized ores and the resulting leach ponds have caused significant wildlife mortality, including the deaths of about 7,613 animals between 1980 and 1989 at cyanide-extraction ponds in California, Nevada, and Arizona (Eisler, 1991).
Brine Mining
Brine mining involves extracting and evaporating the brine solutions to remove harmful elements and compounds (Gruber et al., 2011), potentially releasing them into the environment. The drilling and transport of brine solutions can disrupt existing ecosystems and well casings, pipelines, and storage tanks are subject to corrosion due to the high salinity content of the solutions that they are exposed to, which can lead to leaks and contamination of adjacent bodies of water (New York State Division of Mineral Resources, 1988) Currently, there is no economically plausible plan to clean up contamination of an aquifer by sodium chloride and harmful concentrations of chloride inhibit plant growth and can cause fish kills (Division of Mineral Resources, 1988).
Specific Contaminant Materials
Radionuclides
All REE-bearing minerals contain low levels of the radioactive isotopes that can become concentrated in mine tailings. Radionuclides are released as dust during mining or from exposed waste rock stockpiles where they are least containable (and mostly airborne). Radiation can also leak into the ground, and nearby water sources after they have been separated into tailings, if the tailings are not stored safely. Once radionuclides are in an ecosystem, they accumulate in plants, where the higher concentrations are ingested and ascend the levels of the food chain (Paul & Campbell, 2011).Radioactive contamination has become such a problem that monazite mining has been banned by China and the United States has imposed strict regulations effectively accomplishing the same (Schuler, Buchert , Liu , Stefanie & Merz, 2011).
Dust & Metal
When companies break up materials during mining, the dust can release a variety of heavy metals commonly associated with health problems. As dust, these minerals (such as the asbestos-like mineral riebeckite) can be absorbed into lung tissue, causing problems like pneumoconiosis and silicosis, commonly known as ""Black Lung"" (Paul & Campbell, 2011). Another example of harmful dust generated is flue dust, a byproduct of mining fluorine. According to the Chinese Society of Rare Earths, every ton of REE produced generates 8.5 kilograms of fluorine and 13 kilograms of flue dust, waste materials which contain the heavy metals discussed above (Schuler et al, 2011).
The following chart details how these contaminants enter the environment during mining and refining. Current mining and refining techniques make contaminant release common. Note: the two columns that involve waste rock and the column labeled, ""No site rehabilitation after cease of mining operation"" all involve mining specifically.
This chart illustrates the many environmental hazards associated with mining.
Additional Environmental Problems with Mining:
In addition to the issues addressed above, there are many other environmental issues associated with mining:
Carbon output
Mining, like most heavy industries, is dependent on fossil fuels, which generate the energy needed to operate a mine. To combat these carbon emissions, some countries have enacted regulations requiring emission credits, but many countries do not have codes dealing with carbon output (""Molycorp, inc.,"" 2010). Some form of environmental standards are needed for larger countries like China and Russia, and other developing countries that mine large volumes of strategic minerals.
Erosion and endangered species habitat
Mining is an inherently invasive process that can cause damage to a landscape in an area much larger than the mining site itself. The effects of this damage can continue years after a mine has shut down, including the addition to greenhouse gasses, death of flora and fauna, and erosion of land and habitat.
An example of the scarred land of a Chinese mine is shown above.
Water use and wastewater
Most modern mining techniques have high water demands for extraction, processing, and waste disposal. Wastewater from these processes can pollute water sources nearby and deplete freshwater supplies in the region surrounding the mine. Some mines, such as the Mountain Pass mine in southern California, have implemented waste-water recycling technologies, resulting in a huge decrease in water demands and liquid waste (Molycorp, 2012).
Case Studies
We have compiled three short case studies of environmentally-harmful mines, to illustrate the results on the environment and surrounding community of poorly regulated or monitored mines.
Greenland
Greenland Minerals and Energy Ltd, based out of Australia, planned to open a mine in Greenland in 2013. However, the tailings disposal plan involved storing tailings in the Taseq lake, which will cause pollution of not only the lake, but the rivers leading from it and the ocean beyond. Fluorine, heavy metals, and radioactive decay products would all be introduced into the lake by these tailings (Schuler et al, 2011). Due to the lack of environmental regulations from Denmark, the country overseeing the project, plans for the mine continue to move forward, despite the harmful effects it would have on the environment and the surrounding community.
China
Current estimates state that around 20,000 tons of REEs are illegally mined and exported from ""off-grid"" mines in China every year. It is unlikely that any of these illegal mines have environmental safeguards in place, which means that contamination, dust, and other wastes are not being addressed. This affects the health of the workers as well as destroys the surrounding environment (Schuler et al, 2011).
Molycorp
In 2002, Molycorp had a problem with its waste disposal at Mountain Pass, when a pipeline leading out to evaporation ponds in the desert burst, spilling radioactive and toxic waste onto the desert floor (Danelski, 2009). The resulting uncovering of past spills, coupled with economic factors, caused the shutdown of Mountain Pass and a complete reworking of their environmental practices. However, the damage was done and the area and surrounding water sources are affected, perhaps permanently.
Case studies like these illustrate the result of ignoring the environmental damages of mining, and leaving them unaddressed or unregulated. Mission 2016's plan would address these issues. See the green mining page for more information.
Cost of inaction/action
If no action is taken to remediate the many environmental problems inherent to modern mining, the end cost for governments and communities would be devastating. Already mines in China release 9,600 to 12,000 cubic meters of toxic gas containing flue dust concentrate, hydrofluoric acid, sulfur dioxide, and sulfuric acid for each ton of rare earth elements produced. Additionally, nearly 75 cubic meters of acidic waste water and one ton of radioactive waste residue are generated (Paul & Campbell, 2011). Preemptive actions such as stricter regulations and proper waste disposal strategies can reduce the costs of environmental damage, and in some cases pay for themselves. For example: the US company Molycorp spent 10 million USD on its paste-tailings operation, but the water and chemical reagents it was able to recycle saved have already paid for the installment, in addition to generating less waste. ""Although the operating cost of the paste tailings operation is expected to be greater than it would be for a tailings pond... we expect that increased water recycling and reduced environmental risks associated with the paste tailings facility will ultimately mitigate that additional cost"" (Molycorp, 2012). Mission 2016's plan will increase recycling efforts, greener mining and refining techniques, reduce the cost of environmental damage on the surrounding community, and increase government involvement in the regulation of dirty mining practices.

des,https://environment.des.qld.gov.au/management/compliance-enforcement ,"Compliance and enforcement
As the Queensland Government’s environmental regulator the department manages and monitors environmental risk through a range of assessment, compliance, investigation and enforcement activities.
To ensure compliance with legislation, the department:
- educates individuals, industry and governments about the laws and how to comply with them
- encourages voluntary compliance with obligations
- monitors compliance
- rewards good performers
- responds to breaches of the legislation with consistent and proportionate enforcement action.
To help build a culture of improved voluntary compliance within industry and improve compliance practices the department and has published guidance material and supporting information to help industry understand how to meet its environmental obligations and achieve good environmental practices.
Compliance planning and priorities
All licensed environmentally relevant activities in Queensland have had their risks assessed and expected standards of controls put in place through the enforceable conditions of environmental authorities.
It is the responsibility of the licence holder to comply with the strong environmental standards and obligations required by law and, where a potential environmental risk has been identified, to have appropriate and effective control measures in place to minimise the potential for environmental harm. For example, a tank storing a hazardous chemical has a risk of leaking that can be controlled by maintaining a secondary containment system to capture the chemical in the event of a leak occurring.
The department’s compliance program targets those activities that pose the greatest potential risk to Queensland’s environment and communities. Monitoring licensed operators through regular proactive and reactive compliance activities helps identify breaches and areas of poor performance.
The departmentalso targets unlicensed activities that can pose risks to environment and communities that have not been assessed and controlled, such as illegal tyre storages that can be fire and pollution risks. Fortunately most Queensland businesses seek to do the right thing. For those that don’t the department uses a variety of community, industry and technology-based intelligence sources to identify illegal operations and target them for compliance and enforcement.
Our compliance planning
Our compliance planning is based on:
- Annual Strategic Compliance Priorities 2020–2021
- Prioritised Targeted Compliance Programs—identify and manage issues that pose significant environmental risk.
- Prioritised Unplanned Compliance Events—response to community reports, emerging intelligence and events that have a significant or immediate risk.
- Compliance Prioritisation Model—identifies possible risk for all locations in Queensland that are licensed to carry out environmentally relevant activities under the Environmental Protection Act 1994.
- Regional compliance plans—Queensland is a large state and within it there are different community, industry and environmental drivers that can influence regional compliance plans. For example the north Queensland wet season is typically more significant than in southern parts of the state. Quarterly compliance planning undertaken in each of our four compliance regions (North, Central, Southeast and Southwest) ensures that regional priority risks are accounted for.
Enforcement action
The department has set clear expectations about acceptable standards of environmental performance and takes prompt, strong enforcement action against those operators who choose not to comply with their obligations to demonstrate the consequences for poor performance.
The following guidelines govern how the department makes decisions about appropriate enforcement action.
Enforcement guidelines
- Enforcement guidelines
The department’s Enforcement guidelines ensure its enforcement responses:are proportionate to the conductare consistent with past responses for similar conductoccur in a timely fashion.
- Powers of authorised officers
One way the department achieves compliance with the Acts it administers is through targeted, risk-based inspections conducted by authorised persons of sites impacting on or posing a risk to the environment.
The Powers of authorised persons guideline—ESR/2016/2276 provides an overview of the roles, powers and activities of the department’s authorised officers under the Environmental Protection Act 1994.
- Chain of Responsibility Environmental Protection Order GuidelineThe department must have regard to the guideline when deciding to issue an EPO to a related person.
The Issuing chain of responsibility environmental protection orders under Chapter 7, Part 5, Division 2 of the Environmental Protection Act 1994 Guideline provides information about how the department decides:whether a person has a relevant connection with a companywhether to issue an Environmental Protection Order (EPO) to related persons of a companywhich of the related persons of a company to issue an EPO to.
Penalty infringement notices
Penalty Infringement Notices (PINs) can be issued for a wide range of offences relating to environmental matters—which are prescribed in the State Penalties Enforcement Regulation 2014.
Visit the Queensland Government website for further information on penalty infringement notices (environment and heritage matters) including: paying a fine, voluntary instalment plans, unpaid PINs, disputing an offence, making a statutory declaration, electing to have a matter heard in court, or requesting a review of a littering or illegal dumping PIN.
Outcomes of compliance activities
The department regularly publishes information to help inform and educate operators and the community about its compliance and enforcement activities.
- Environmental Regulatory Update
Environmental Regulatory Update is a regular e-mail bulletin sent to subscribers providing the latest information about important compliance and enforcement information.

Key Environmental Parameters
Carbon Dioxide
CO2 is part of the human metabolism. It is produced when, for example, carbohydrates are metabolized to generate energy. The produced CO2 is then transported out of the body by respiration. The CO2 concentration in the inhaled air is decisive for the metabolism. Depending on the level of the concentration in the air breathed in, various symptoms can occur that affect daily life and health. High CO2 concentrations in the air we breathe lead to concentration problems and fatigue. The performance potential of people in the room decreases constantly the higher the amount of CO2 in the air gets. Furthermore, CO2 concentrations relate to the potential of virus infections.
The level of CO2 in the air can be thought of as a ""traffic light"" system: Green is between 400–1'000 ppm; yellow is between 1'000–1'600 ppm and is where 80% of people are satisfied with perceived air quality; red is ≥1'600 ppm and is where there are detectable negative impacts on human health and well-being. At this level, the air quality is considered poor and the risk of viral transmission is increased.
Humidity and Temperature
Do you find it hard to breathe in your home some days? Are you more prone to headaches and asthma attacks during the summer months? You’re not allergic to heat - but you may have serious humidity problems in your home or office. When we talk about indoor air quality, humidity is one of the main things we’re referring to. Too high or too low humidity levels in closed spaces can lead to various issues. For example, bacteria and viruses that cause respiratory infections thrive in extremely high and extremely low humidity. Mold spores, dust mites and other allergens survive best in high humidity environments. Furthermore, higher humidity can increase the levels of noxious chemicals in the air, which may include ozone and formaldehyde.
40-60 % relative humidity is an optimal level for the immune system and our respiratory system. It reduces the spread of seasonal respiratory diseases and increases well-being. Scientists are therefore calling on the WHO (World Health Organization) to revise the global guidelines for indoor air quality with the petition 40to60RH. Click here to learn more about it.
Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs)
VOCs originate from a number of different possible sources, like building materials, tobacco smoke, people and their activities, and indoor chemical reactions. Exceptionally high VOC levels are typically found in new buildings or after renovation. Further, when using products that contain VOCs, such as air fresheners or cleaning agents, people expose themselves and others to high pollutant levels that can persist long after the activity has finished. A number of systematic human exposure studies have shown various adverse health
effects caused by exposure to elevated VOC levels. Among the effects reported by participants are dryness and irritation of the eye, the nose and the throat, headaches, and dizziness.
Sensirion’s powerful VOC Algorithm analyzes VOC events detected by the SGP40 sensor and maps them to a VOC Index. This VOC Index provides a practical quantification of VOC events relative to each individual sensor’s typical indoor environment. In this way, it behaves similarly to the human nose, which is highly susceptible to changes in odor, but it also detects VOC events that are not perceived by humans. The VOC Index indicates to what extent the indoor air quality has deteriorated or improved compared to the sensor’s typical VOC environment. Learn more about the VOC index at www.sensirion.com/sgp40.
Particulate Matter (PM2.5)
Particulate Matter (PM) is a complex mixture of solids and aerosols composed of small droplets of liquid, dry solid fragments, and solid cores with liquid coatings. Particles are defined by their diameter for air quality regulatory purposes. Those with a diameter of 10 microns or less (PM10) are inhalable into the lungs and can induce adverse health effects. A number of adverse health impacts have been associated with exposure to PM2.5. Short-term exposures (up to 24-hours duration) have been associated with premature mortality, increased hospital admissions for heart or lung causes, acute and chronic bronchitis, asthma attacks, emergency room visits, respiratory symptoms, and restricted activity days.
Indoor PM levels are dependent on several factors including outdoor levels, infiltration, types of ventilation and filtration systems used, indoor sources, and personal activities of occupants. In homes without smoking or other strong particle sources, indoor PM would be expected to be the same as, or lower than, outdoor levels. To know what the limits of PM exposure are, please consider official air quality standards. The US Environmental Protection Agency defines the AQI levels as follows: With regard to primary (health-based) standards for fine particles (generally referring to particles less than or equal to 2.5 micrometers (mm) in diameter, PM2.5), the EPA is revising the annual PM2.5 standard by lowering the level to 12.0 micrograms per cubic meter (mg/m3) so as to provide increased protection against health effects associated with long- and short-term exposures (including premature mortality, increased hospital admissions and emergency department visits, and development of chronic respiratory disease), and to retain the 24-hour PM2.5 standard at a level of 35 mg/m3.
Formaldehyde
Formaldehyde (chemical formula H2-C=O or often HCHO) is a colorless gas and the simplest organic molecule containing C, O, and H. It is highly reactive and has several natural and man-made sources. Formaldehyde concentrations are much higher indoors than outdoors and hence formaldehyde is qualified as a very specific indoor pollutant.
The most significant sources of formaldehyde are likely to be pressed wood products such as particleboard, plywood, or medium-density fiber board (MDF) made using formaldehyde-based resins. These materials are frequently used as sub-flooring and shelving and in cabinetry and furniture. Elevated formaldehyde concentrations can be present in freshly built, furnished, or painted rooms for months.
Health effects
In relevant concentrations, formaldehyde is a pungent-smelling gas, can cause watery eyes, burning sensations in the eyes and throat, nausea, and difficulty in breathing. Sensory irritation by formaldehyde has been reported for concentrations as low as 0.15 mg/m3 (120 ppb). High concentrations may trigger attacks in people with asthma. There is evidence that some people can develop a sensitivity to formaldehyde. It has also been shown to cause cancer in animals and formaldehyde is classified by IARC as carcinogenic to humans (Group 1).
Guidelines and Standards
The WHO has established an indoor air quality guideline for exposure to formaldehyde of 0.1 mg/m3 (80 ppb) as a 30-minute average. Local guidelines range from 8 ppb to 100 ppb depending on the environment and duration of exposure

Hot Topics
Reduce the risk of virus infection in classrooms
Ventilate indoor spaces regularly and thoroughly - this is recommended by the Federal Environment Agency to reduce the risk of Sars CoV-2 infection. This announcement is particularly relevant in view of the fact that the school has started again at full class size. For this reason, the supply of fresh air in the classrooms should also be as high as possible, regardless of other protective measures such as keeping minimum distances or wearing a mouth-and-nose cover. After all, droplets and tiny aerosol particles should play a decisive role in the transmission of Sars-CoV-2. Especially the aerosol particles that are produced when breathing, coughing, speaking and sneezing can float in the air for hours or days, according to current knowledge. Consistent ventilation can significantly reduce the risk of infection, but cannot provide 100% protection.
Petition ""40to60RH""
It has been proven that indoor humidity plays an important role in preventing virus transmission and improving the response of the immune system. Extensive research shows that a relative humidity (RH) between 40% and 60% is optimal to minimise the spread of viruses such as influenza. Scientists are therefore calling on the WHO to revise the global guidelines for indoor air quality.
The importance of indoor humitidy is crucial to us. As market leader in humidity sensing it is important to us to support petition 40to60RH. Improving people's health is part of our mission and therefore we encourage everyone to support this petition to gain the attention of the World Health Organization.

Environmental pollution refers to the contamination of ecosystem and the surrounding atmosphere by different forms of pollutants (Chemicals and energies). Climate change refers to the variation in normal weather patterns caused due to pollution. The issue of environmental pollution and climate change has become an international concern due to their unfavorable affects to the physical and biological entities of the environment.
‘Environment Pollution and Climate Change’ is an international, open access research journal that convers several problems, associated risks, remediation methods and techniques pertaining to air, water, soil, noise, thermal, radioactive and light pollutions and climate change. This peer reviewed journal reports original and novel research observations in regard to environmental pollution and climate change thereby contributing to the new knowledge addition in the field.
The Atmosphere is a blend of nitrogen (78%), oxygen (21%), and different gasses (1%) that encompasses earth. High over the planet, the climate gets to be more slender until it reaches space. It is partitioned into five layers. The majority of the climate and mists are found in the principal layer.
Atmosphere is the main shield of earth which protects it from sun's harmful radiations.

Ecosystem may be defined as a biological community in which a group of living life forms live in conjunction with the nonliving segments of their surroundings (things like air, water and mineral soil), associating as a system.These biotic and abiotic parts are viewed as connected together through supplement cycles and vitality flows.
Ecosystem is characterized by the system of interactions among living beings, and amongst life forms and their environment. Ecosystem provides us huge amount of useful goods and benefits upon which each and every life form depends. Ecosystem management principles helps us to know that instead of managing individual species, natural resources should be managed at ecosystem level.

The ecological effect of pesticides comprises of the impacts of pesticides on non-target species. More than 98% of showered bug sprays and 95% of herbicides achieve a goal other than their objective species, since they are splashed or spread crosswise over whole farming fields. Runoff can convey pesticides into sea-going situations while wind can convey them to different fields, eating ranges, human settlements and undeveloped territories, potentially influencing different species.
Different issues rise up out of poor generation, transport and storage practices. Over time, repeated application expands pest resistance, while its consequences for different species can encourage the pest resurgence.

Water Pollution is the global issue. Metro cities throughout the world are suffering from water loss. As the harmful effluents dumped in water through major Civilizations has created a hazard and a global topic for concern.
Waste product from factories, harmful chemicals from industries, dumping of household waste, dumping of medical and other hazardous waste directy into the water results in the deterioration of quality of water which ultimately leads to loss of drinking water and even deaths of various life forms.
Aquatic life forms mainly suffer beacause of water pollution because of loss of enough amount of fresh dissolved oxygen in water bodies due to raised volume of toxicity in water. Toxicity which is a result of water pollution leads to death of aquatic life forms.

Rainfall is a natural phenomenon by which earths water is circulated back to various water bodies in form of droplet. When water vapour rises up and gets condensed precipitation occurs which is called as rainfall.
Rain water when mixed with smoke of burning coal and other fossil fuels which contains waste gases such as sulphur and nitrogen oxides, gives rise to acid which falls on earth in form acidic rainfall.

Climate change is an adjustment in the normal or average weather of a region or city. This could be an adjustment in an area's normal yearly precipitation. On the other hand it could be an adjustment in an area's normal temperature for a given month or season.
Climate change is brought about by variables, for example, biotic procedures, variation in sunlight based radiation recieved by Earth, plate tectonics, and volcanic eruptions. Certain human activities have likewise been distinguished as critical reasons for recent climate change, often referred to as global warming.

Drought is a deceptive risk of nature. It is frequently alluded to as a ""creeping phenomenon"" and its effects fluctuate from area to district. Drought can along these lines be troublesome for individuals to get it. In the most broad sense, drought begins from an insufficiency of precipitation over an expanded time frame - typically a season or more- - bringing about a water deficiency for some action, bunch, or natural segment. Its effects result from the transaction between the characteristic occasion (less precipitation than anticipated) and the interest individuals place on water supply, and human exercises can exacerbate the impacts of drought. Since dry season can't be seen exclusively as a physical marvel, it is generally characterized both conceptually and operationally.
Drought is an extended time of lacking precipitation bringing about broad harm to crops, bringing about loss of yield

Disaster management (or crisis management) is the production of arrangements through which groups diminish defenselessness to risks and adapt to disasters. Disaster management does not deflect or take out the dangers; rather, it concentrates on making arrangements to diminish the impact of calamities. Inability to make an arrangement could prompt human mortality, lost income, and harm to resources. As of now in the United States 60 percent of organizations don't have emergency management plans. events on which disater management focuses includes acts of terrorism, industrial sabotage, fire, natural disasters (such as earthquakes, hurricanes, etc.), public disorder, industrial accidents, and communication failures.

The ozone layer, ozone shield or ozonosphere is a locale of Earth's stratosphere that retains the greater part of the Sun's bright (UV) radiation. It contains high centralizations of ozone (O3) in connection to different parts of the atmosphere, albeit still little in connection to different gasses in the stratosphere.
The ozone layer was found in 1913 by the French physicists Charles Fabry and Henri Buisson. The ozone layer ingests 97 to 99 percent of the Sun's medium-frequency bright light (from around 200 nm to 315 nm wavelength), which generally would conceivably harm exposed life forms close to the surface.

These gasses are being supplanted by different mixes: hydrochlorofluorocarbons, an interval substitution for CFCs that are likewise secured under the Montreal Protocol, and hydrofluorocarbons, which are covered under the Kyoto Protocol.

Earth's climate has changed throughout history. Just in the last 650,000 years there have been seven cycles of glacial advance and retreat, with the abrupt end of the last ice age about 11,700 years ago marking the beginning of the modern climate era — and of human civilization. Most of these climate changes are attributed to very small variations in Earth’s orbit that change the amount of solar energy our planet receives.
Scientific evidence for warming of the climate system is unequivocal.
The current warming trend is of particular significance because most of it is extremely likely (greater than 95% probability) to be the result of human activity since the mid-20th century and proceeding at a rate that is unprecedented over decades to millennia.1
Earth-orbiting satellites and other technological advances have enabled scientists to see the big picture, collecting many different types of information about our planet and its climate on a global scale. This body of data, collected over many years, reveals the signals of a changing climate.
The heat-trapping nature of carbon dioxide and other gases was demonstrated in the mid-19th century.2 Their ability to affect the transfer of infrared energy through the atmosphere is the scientific basis of many instruments flown by NASA. There is no question that increased levels of greenhouse gases must cause Earth to warm in response.
Ice cores drawn from Greenland, Antarctica, and tropical mountain glaciers show that Earth’s climate responds to changes in greenhouse gas levels. Ancient evidence can also be found in tree rings, ocean sediments, coral reefs, and layers of sedimentary rocks. This ancient, or paleoclimate, evidence reveals that current warming is occurring roughly ten times faster than the average rate of ice-age-recovery warming. Carbon dioxide from human activity is increasing more than 250 times faster than it did from natural sources after the last Ice Age.3
The evidence for rapid climate change is compelling:
Global Temperature Rise
The planet's average surface temperature has risen about 2.12 degrees Fahrenheit (1.18 degrees Celsius) since the late 19th century, a change driven largely by increased carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere and other human activities.4 Most of the warming occurred in the past 40 years, with the seven most recent years being the warmest. The years 2016 and 2020 are tied for the warmest year on record. 5

Warming Ocean
The ocean has absorbed much of this increased heat, with the top 100 meters (about 328 feet) of ocean showing warming of more than 0.6 degrees Fahrenheit (0.33 degrees Celsius) since 1969.6 Earth stores 90% of the extra energy in the ocean.

Warming ocean waters melting the undersides of Antarctic ice shelves, leading to calving increases at the ice fronts, are responsible for most of the continent's ice shelf mass loss, a study by NASA and university researchers found. Ice lost from the ice sheets' margins far exceed any gains in the interiors.
Shrinking Ice Sheets
The Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets have decreased in mass. Data from NASA's Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment show Greenland lost an average of 279 billion tons of ice per year between 1993 and 2019, while Antarctica lost about 148 billion tons of ice per year.7

Ocean Acidification
Since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, the acidity of surface ocean waters has increased by about 30%.13,14 This increase is the result of humans emitting more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and hence more being absorbed into the ocean. The ocean has absorbed between 20% and 30% of total anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions in recent decades (7.2 to 10.8 billion metric tons per year).15,16

In 1824, Joseph Fourier calculated that an Earth-sized planet, at our distance from the Sun, ought to be much colder. He suggested something in the atmosphere must be acting like an insulating blanket. In 1856, Eunice Foote discovered that blanket, showing that carbon dioxide and water vapor in Earth's atmosphere trap escaping infrared (heat) radiation.
In the 1860s, physicist John Tyndall recognized Earth's natural greenhouse effect and suggested that slight changes in the atmospheric composition could bring about climatic variations. In 1896, a seminal paper by Swedish scientist Svante Arrhenius first predicted that changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide levels could substantially alter the surface temperature through the greenhouse effect.

visit the website . The Causes of Climate Change
Scientists attribute the global warming trend observed since the mid-20th century to the human expansion of the ""greenhouse effect""1 — warming that results when the atmosphere traps heat radiating from Earth toward space.
Certain gases in the atmosphere block heat from escaping. Long-lived gases that remain semi-permanently in the atmosphere and do not respond physically or chemically to changes in temperature are described as ""forcing"" climate change. Gases, such as water vapor, which respond physically or chemically to changes in temperature are seen as ""feedbacks.""
Gases that contribute to the greenhouse effect include:
- Water vapor. The most abundant greenhouse gas, but importantly, it acts as a feedback to the climate. Water vapor increases as the Earth's atmosphere warms, but so does the possibility of clouds and precipitation, making these some of the most important feedback mechanisms to the greenhouse effect.
- Carbon dioxide (CO2). A minor but very important component of the atmosphere, carbon dioxide is released through natural processes such as respiration and volcano eruptions and through human activities such as deforestation, land use changes, and burning fossil fuels. Humans have increased atmospheric CO2 concentration by 47% since the Industrial Revolution began. This is the most important long-lived ""forcing"" of climate change.
- Methane. A hydrocarbon gas produced both through natural sources and human activities, including the decomposition of wastes in landfills, agriculture, and especially rice cultivation, as well as ruminant digestion and manure management associated with domestic livestock. On a molecule-for-molecule basis, methane is a far more active greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide, but also one which is much less abundant in the atmosphere.
- Nitrous oxide. A powerful greenhouse gas produced by soil cultivation practices, especially the use of commercial and organic fertilizers, fossil fuel combustion, nitric acid production, and biomass burning.
- Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). Synthetic compounds entirely of industrial origin used in a number of applications, but now largely regulated in production and release to the atmosphere by international agreement for their ability to contribute to destruction of the ozone layer. They are also greenhouse gases.
On Earth, human activities are changing the natural greenhouse. Over the last century the burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil has increased the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). This happens because the coal or oil burning process combines carbon with oxygen in the air to make CO2. To a lesser extent, the clearing of land for agriculture, industry, and other human activities has increased concentrations of greenhouse gases.
The consequences of changing the natural atmospheric greenhouse are difficult to predict, but some effects seem likely:
- On average, Earth will become warmer. Some regions may welcome warmer temperatures, but others may not.
- Warmer conditions will probably lead to more evaporation and precipitation overall, but individual regions will vary, some becoming wetter and others dryer.
- A stronger greenhouse effect will warm the ocean and partially melt glaciers and ice sheets, increasing sea level. Ocean water also will expand if it warms, contributing further to sea level rise.
Outside of a greenhouse, higher atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) levels can have both positive and negative effects on crop yields. Some laboratory experiments suggest that elevated CO2 levels can increase plant growth. However, other factors, such as changing temperatures, ozone, and water and nutrient constraints, may more than counteract anypotential increase in yield. If optimal temperature ranges for some crops are exceeded, earlier possible gains in yield may be reduced or reversed altogether.
Climate extremes, such as droughts, floods and extreme temperatures, can lead to crop losses and threaten the livelihoods of agricultural producers and the food security of communities worldwide. Depending on the crop and ecosystem, weeds, pests, and fungi can also thrive under warmer temperatures, wetter climates, and increased CO2 levels, and climate change will likely increase weeds and pests.
Finally, although rising CO2 can stimulate plant growth, research has shown that it can also reduce the nutritional value of most food crops by reducing the concentrations of protein and essential minerals in most plant species. Climate change can cause new patterns of pests and diseases to emerge, affecting plants, animals and humans, and posing new risks for food security, food safety and human health.2
The Role of Human Activity
In its Fifth Assessment Report, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a group of 1,300 independent scientific experts from countries all over the world under the auspices of the United Nations, concluded there's a more than 95 percent probability that human activities over the past 50 years have warmed our planet.
The industrial activities that our modern civilization depends upon have raised atmospheric carbon dioxide levels from 280 parts per million to 414 parts per million in the last 150 years. The panel also concluded there's a better than 95 percent probability that human-produced greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide have caused much of the observed increase in Earth's temperatures over the past 50 years.
The panel's full Summary for Policymakers report is online at https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/ipcc_wg3_ar5_summary-for-policymakers.pdf.
Solar Irradiance
It's reasonable to assume that changes in the Sun's energy output would cause the climate to change, since the Sun is the fundamental source of energy that drives our climate system.
Indeed, studies show that solar variability has played a role in past climate changes. For example, a decrease in solar activity coupled with an increase in volcanic activity is thought to have helped trigger the Little Ice Age between approximately 1650 and 1850, when Greenland cooled from 1410 to the 1720s and glaciers advanced in the Alps.
But several lines of evidence show that current global warming cannot be explained by changes in energy from the Sun:
- Since 1750, the average amount of energy coming from the Sun either remained constant or increased slightly.
- If the warming were caused by a more active Sun, then scientists would expect to see warmer temperatures in all layers of the atmosphere. Instead, they have observed a cooling in the upper atmosphere, and a warming at the surface and in the lower parts of the atmosphere. That's because greenhouse gases are trapping heat in the lower atmosphere.
- Climate models that include solar irradiance changes can’t reproduce the observed temperature trend over the past century or more without including a rise in greenhouse gases.

The Earth’s surface contains a number of diverse natural environments. A natural environment can be defined as the flora, fauna, rocks, minerals, and atmosphere that make up a single ecological system, often spanning a large area. Natural environments often overlap and compete with both each other and with human-built environments, such as cities, manufacturing plants, and parks.
Different types of natural environments include oceans, grasslands, tundra, rainforests, and deserts. Each environment has unique soils, climates, water systems, and weather phenomena that are capable of supporting the life forms located in that environment. Natural environments are constantly changing and can be greatly impacted by Earth’s physical and chemical changes. The diversity of natural environment types reflects the rich variety of flora and fauna species on Earth, and the different conditions necessary for them to thrive.
The term ecosystem, meaning a system of living organisms in an area that depends on the proximate non-living resources to survive and reproduce, is often used interchangeably with the term natural environment. While this is correct in some cases, it is important to note that a single natural environment can also contain multiple ecosystems. The oceans are a good example of this, as the flora and fauna that thrives in coastal regions requires very different living conditions than the organisms found in the deep ocean.
Rain forest environments are one type of natural ecosystem. In total, rain forests produce 40 percent of the oxygen on Earth, despite only taking up 6 percent of the Earth’s surface. They are made up of four layers: emergent, upper canopy, understory, and forest floor. While these layers are all part of one environment, the flora and fauna differ from layer to layer.
Rain forests get their name from the fact that they are almost completely self watering. Each tree that reaches the canopy level is able to release about 200 gallons of water into the air per year. This creates a permanent cloud that hangs low over the canopy, helping the forest stay hydrated between periods of rainfall. This creates a fertile environment for plants, with two thirds of the total plant species on Earth growing in the rain forest. In recent years, rain forest environments have been threatened by deforestation, and scientists have warned that further logging in rain forests could have long term negative effects on the Earth’s climate.
Ocean environments are found all over the world, and are the largest natural environment. More than 70 percent of the earth’s surface is covered by oceans, and they contain a total of 97 percent of our water supply. The world’s oceans support many unique habitats–phytoplankton, kelp, and seaweed thrive at the surface, and tube worms, mussels, and clams live on the deep sea floor thanks to hydrothermal vents that pump minerals from the Earth’s crust into the ocean.
Desert environments can be found on every continent, and can be either very hot and sandy or very cold and icy. While desert environments have a reputation as an inhospitable place to live, about one sixth of Earth’s total human population lives in a desert environment. Deserts are distinguished by the fact that they are likely to regularly lose more moisture through evaporation than they receive through precipitation. Flora and fauna that live in desert environments have found ways to adapt to the harsh living conditions. Plants that may not receive water for several years at a time have adapted by either finding water with their roots deep underground, or by being able to store reserves of water for long periods of time. In hot desert environments, many animals avoid the heat by living a nocturnal lifestyle, only searching for food and water at night.
Grasslands are environments that are formed when an area receives too much precipitation to be classified as a desert, but not enough precipitation to support a forest environment. They are characterized by their most populous form of plant–grass.
The two types of grasslands are tropical and temperate, with tropical grasslands usually falling in the southern hemisphere. Tropical grasslands have both a dry season and a rainy season. Because these tropical environments receive more rain than temperate grasslands, their grasses can grow up to 7 feet tall. Temperate grasslands are characterized by shorter grasses, and have both a growing season and a dormant season. During the dormant season, no grass grows in these environments due to cold temperatures.
Tundra environments can be found around the tops of mountains and in the Arctic. Mountain tundra environments are home to sheep, birds, and mountain goats, while the Arctic tundra houses animals like polar bears, caribou, and Arctic foxes. The tundra is one of the most inhospitable environments for plants and animals, with a cold climate, low rainfall, frequent winds, long winters, and short summers. The tundra environment is highly vulnerable to the effects of global warming, as species are being displaced from disappearing Arctic permafrost into tundra environments, disrupting the tundra’s ecological balance. . How Do Humans Adapt to Their Environment?
Humans adapt to changes in the environment by genetic change, developmental adjustments, acclimatization, and cultural or technological advances. Of these, the fourth is almost uniquely human and has been the key to the species' success worldwide.
Genetic change in humans is slow, but it is known to occur. In Europe, during the last ice age, a variety of humans called Neanderthals developed a number of cold-weather adaptations that presumably helped them survive in the frigid climate. Among these were a stocky frame, large noses for efficient heat exchange and thick, robust bones that permitted the attachment of large muscles.
Developmental adjustments are faster than genetic evolution, as they play out on a generational scale. After World War II, for example, the common diet of Japanese people changed to include more animal protein. While this had no effect on Japanese adults, their children and grandchildren grew faster during childhood to an average of 7 inches taller.
Acclimatization is even faster than developmental adjustments and can work within a single individual's lifetime. An example of this is the body's ability to add and shed fat in response to a changing diet.
Cultural and technological changes are among the most complex adaptations humans use. Clothes, fire and radio communications are all technologies humans have developed as insulation against the demands of the natural world. .

esf,https://www.esf.edu/nativepeoples/ ,"Our region is the home of two great intellectual traditions regarding stewardship of the earth: traditional ecological knowledge of indigenous people and scientific ecological knowledge. The mission of the SUNY-ESF Center for Native Peoples and the Environment is to create programs that draw on the wisdom of both indigenous and scientific knowledge in support of our shared goals of environmental sustainability.
In addition to serving as a bridge between traditional ecological knowledge and western scientific approaches, the Center incorporates indigenous perspectives and knowledge for the benefit of native students and work to educate mainstream students in a cross-cultural context.
The Center includes a significant outreach element focused on increasing educational opportunities for Native American students in environmental sciences, research collaborations, and partnerships with Native American communities to address local environmental problems.
ESF is located within the original territory of the Haudenosaunee, or Iroquois, Confederacy. The college's main campus, its Heiberg Forest and its Lafayette Road Experiment Station are all within the Land Rights Action of the Onondaga Nation. The Onondaga Nation maintains its own distinct government, language and customs based on a smaller portion of its original land base located south of Syracuse.
Solutions to complex ecological problems require not only scientific expertise, but also understanding of the cultural context in which they occur. Cross-cultural competence thus becomes an important component of functioning effectively in the global scientific community. This is particularly true in the environmental disciplines, where science and culture intersect.
The Center programs can provide a framework for increased participation of traditionally underrepresented Native American students in the scientific community. The Center is dedicated to nurturing the success of Native American students through its efforts in outreach at the pre-college level, in student recruitment, retention and support.
Traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) is increasingly valued by academics, agency scientists and policy makers as a potential source of ideas for emerging models of ecosystem management, conservation biology and ecological restoration.
Indigenous people are the stewards of fully 4% of the land area of the United States and represent some 700 distinct communities possessing detailed knowledge of the biota of their homelands. Native American land holdings in North America collectively contain more wildlands than all of the National Parks and Nature Conservancy areas in North America.
However, the majority of scientific professionals and educators have little understanding of the value of TEK or its cultural context. Exposure to TEK has a legitimate role in the education of the next generation of biologists, environmental scientists, and natural resource managers. TEK has value not only for the wealth of biological information it contains, but for the cultural framework of respect, reciprocity and responsibility in which it is embedded. (Kimmerer 1998, Pierotti and Wildcat 2000). The Center for Native People and the Environment will develop a series of integrated educational offerings that will enrich our curriculum with coursework and allied programs that increase student’s awareness of TEK and Native American perspectives on the environment.

allthingsnature,https://www.allthingsnature.org/what-are-environmental-factors.htm ,"What Are Environmental Factors?
The term “environmental factors” is a vague one that can refer to any physical or non-physical element that has an impact on plants, animals, and people who live in the area affected by the factor. Environmental factors play a role in everything from health to behavior, and can differ in significance between industries. For example, in medicine, the term refers to elements that impact health, while in horticulture, it refers to elements that aid or prevent the growth of plants.
Numerous different types of environmental factors play a role in the survival of a species. While those factors can vary, the most important factors include weather, water supply, and air quality. These three factors can affect just about everyone and everything in a specific environment, as well as directly impact each other. For example, both weather and pollution can affect water supply, and extreme pollution may affect the weather.
Weather-related environmental factors play a large role in everything from growing crops to driving to work. Most plants need specific climates in which to grow and thrive, and even the slightest unexpected change in temperature can ruin a crop. Icy or snow-covered roads can make getting to work difficult, which can result in loss of productivity. Those who live in areas affected by extreme weather often adapt and plan accordingly, but sudden shifts in weather patterns can make planning more difficult. For example, areas that rarely see snow may be unprepared in the event of an unexpected blizzard.
Just about every living thing needs an adequate supply of clean water to survive. While most developed countries have access to a steady supply of high-quality water, those in underdeveloped nations often struggle to find an uncontaminated source. A lack of clean water can lead to diseased crops, animals, and people. Even in developed countries, water can become a rare commodity during times of drought. Adapting to changes in water supply by restricting unnecessary use becomes very important during these times.
Like weather and water, air quality is another one of the environmental factors that plays a large role in the overall health of a species. Pollution in the air not only wreaks havoc on the health of the population, but can also be damaging to the physical structures. Even short-term exposure to pollution can negatively impact health by compromising the respiratory system.
Some environmental factors, such as clean water and air pollution, can be changed if the population of an area takes steps to improve the quality of their environment. Others, like the weather, are out of anyone’s control. Adapting to new factors is one of the most important ways to ensure survival in a constantly changing environment. .

- TAKE ACTION: Do you agree that we need drastic action to address the climate emergency? Sign on here >>
From coastal towns to rural farms to urban centers, climate change poses an existential threat – not just to our environment, but to our health, our communities, our national security, and our economic well-being. It also damages our communities with storms that wreak havoc on our towns and cities and our homes and schools. It puts our national security at risk by leading to regional instability that will require U.S military-supported relief activities and could make areas more vulnerable to terrorist activities.
Joe Biden knows there is no greater challenge facing our country and our world. That’s why he is outlining a bold plan – a Clean Energy Revolution – to address this grave threat and lead the world in addressing the climate emergency.
Biden believes the Green New Deal is a crucial framework for meeting the climate challenges we face. It powerfully captures two basic truths, which are at the core of his plan: (1) the United States urgently needs to embrace greater ambition on an epic scale to meet the scope of this challenge, and (2) our environment and our economy are completely and totally connected.
If we can harness all of our energy and talents, and unmatchable American innovation, we can turn this threat into an opportunity to revitalize the U.S. energy sector and boost growth economy-wide. We can create new industries that reinvigorate our manufacturing and create high-quality, middle-class jobs in cities and towns across the United States. We can lead America to become the world’s clean energy superpower. We can export our clean-energy technology across the globe and create high-quality, middle-class jobs here at home. Getting to a 100% clean energy economy is not only an obligation, it’s an opportunity. We should fully adopt a clean energy future, not just for all of us today, but for our children and grandchildren, so their tomorrow is healthier, safer, and more just.
As president, Biden will lead the world to address the climate emergency and lead through the power of example, by ensuring the U.S. achieves a 100% clean energy economy and net-zero emissions no later than 2050.
The Biden Plan will:
- Ensure the U.S. achieves a 100% clean energy economy and reaches net-zero emissions no later than 2050. On day one, Biden will sign a series of new executive orders with unprecedented reach that go well beyond the Obama-Biden Administration platform and put us on the right track. And, he will demand that Congress enacts legislation in the first year of his presidency that: 1) establishes an enforcement mechanism that includes milestone targets no later than the end of his first term in 2025, 2) makes a historic investment in clean energy and climate research and innovation, 3) incentivizes the rapid deployment of clean energy innovations across the economy, especially in communities most impacted by climate change.
- Build a stronger, more resilient nation. On day one, Biden will make smart infrastructure investments to rebuild the nation and to ensure that our buildings, water, transportation, and energy infrastructure can withstand the impacts of climate change. Every dollar spent toward rebuilding our roads, bridges, buildings, the electric grid, and our water infrastructure will be used to prevent, reduce, and withstand a changing climate. As President, Biden will use the convening power of government to boost climate resilience efforts by developing regional climate resilience plans, in partnership with local universities and national labs, for local access to the most relevant science, data, information, tools, and training.
- Rally the rest of the world to meet the threat of climate change. Climate change is a global challenge that requires decisive action from every country around the world. Joe Biden knows how to stand with America’s allies, stand up to adversaries, and level with any world leader about what must be done. He will not only recommit the United States to the Paris Agreement on climate change – he will go much further than that. He will lead an effort to get every major country to ramp up the ambition of their domestic climate targets. He will make sure those commitments are transparent and enforceable, and stop countries from cheating by using America’s economic leverage and power of example. He will fully integrate climate change into our foreign policy and national security strategies, as well as our approach to trade.
- Stand up to the abuse of power by polluters who disproportionately harm communities of color and low-income communities. Vulnerable communities are disproportionately impacted by the climate emergency and pollution. The Biden Administration will take action against fossil fuel companies and other polluters who put profit over people and knowingly harm our environment and poison our communities’ air, land, and water, or conceal information regarding potential environmental and health risks. The Biden plan will ensure that communities across the country from Flint, Michigan to Harlan, Kentucky to the New Hampshire Seacoast have access to clean, safe drinking water. And he’ll make sure the development of solutions is an inclusive, community-driven process.
- Fulfill our obligation to workers and communities who powered our industrial revolution and subsequent decades of economic growth. This is support they’ve earned for fueling our country’s industrial revolution and decades of economic growth. We’re not going to leave any workers or communities behind.
And, Biden has committed that Biden for President will not accept contributions from oil, gas and coal corporations or executives.
The Biden plan will make a historic investment in our clean energy future and environmental justice, paid for by rolling back the Trump tax incentives that enrich corporations at the expense of American jobs and the environment. Biden’s climate and environmental justice proposal will make a federal investment of $1.7 trillion over the next ten years, leveraging additional private sector and state and local investments to total to more than $5 trillion. President Trump’s tax cut led to trillions in stock buybacks and created new incentives to shift profits abroad. Joe Biden believes we should instead invest in a Clean Energy Revolution that creates jobs here at home.
The Biden plan will be paid for by reversing the excesses of the Trump tax cuts for corporations, reducing incentives for tax havens, evasion, and outsourcing, ensuring corporations pay their fair share, closing other loopholes in our tax code that reward wealth not work, and ending subsidies for fossil fuels.
JOE BIDEN: A “CLIMATE CHANGE PIONEER.” Joe Biden has long appreciated the enormity of climate change and has always believed that we have a moral and economic imperative to address it. In 1986, he introduced one of the first-ever climate bills in Congress. Politifact recently called him a “climate change pioneer” and dubbed his early leadership “a watershed moment.”
As Chair of the Foreign Relations Committee, he organized several hearings on climate change and rallied support on a number of nonbinding resolutions on the issue, in an attempt to build momentum for action to address global climate change. In 1998, he was a key champion for the Tropical Forest Conservation Act, which allowed the U.S. to reach agreements with foreign governments to conserve tropical forests in exchange for debt relief (commonly referred to as debt-for-nature swaps).
In 2006, Senator Biden took executives from BP and Chevron to task for the subsidies going to the oil industry.
As Vice President, he oversaw the Recovery Act, the largest single investment in clean energy in U.S. history. The Obama-Biden Administration placed historic limits on carbon pollution, doubled fuel economy standards for cars and trucks, unleashed the potential of renewable, clean energy, and rallied the world to achieve the groundbreaking Paris Climate Accords.
Biden also understands that the movement towards a cleaner future comes from all of us. At a recent speech at the United States Conference of Mayors, he applauded efforts cities and states have taken on their own as the federal government has been absent for the last three years.
The Biden Promise – Science, Not Fiction
“Humans have released an increasing amount of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere through burning fossil fuels, and to a lesser extent, deforestation and land-use change. […] This change has intensified the natural greenhouse effect, driving an increase in surface temperatures and other widespread changes in Earth’s climate that are unprecedented in the history of modern civilization.” – Fourth National Climate Assessment
Humans’ contribution to the greenhouse effect is indisputable. Top climate experts, including the authors of the Fourth National Climate Assessment and the Intergovernmental Panel On Climate Change Special Report, have all concluded that human activities are estimated to have caused an approximate 1.0°C rise in the Earth’s global temperature to date. Excessive CO2 emissions caused by human activities, such as the burning of fossil fuels, have contributed to a severe exacerbation of a natural phenomenon known as the greenhouse effect. This natural occurrence takes place when solar radiation directed toward earth reaches the atmosphere. The atmosphere reflects some of the radiation, but approximately 70% of the radiation is absorbed by the land and water thereby heating the earth. Due to the additional greenhouse gases emitted by humans – such as carbon dioxide, water vapor, methane, nitrous oxide, and chlorofluorocarbons – more heat than normal is being trapped, contributing to an overall rise in global temperature.
If the global temperature continues to increase at the current rate and surpasses 1.5°C, the existential threat to life will not be limited to just ecological systems, but will extend to human life as well. We have already begun to witness the impacts on biodiversity and the ecosystem, as species loss and extinction have disturbingly accelerated as a result of increasing ocean temperature, shrinking ice sheets, rising sea levels, and much more. As the effects of global warming worsen, human health, livelihood, food security, water supply, and economic growth will be jeopardized. It is incumbent on us to implement a plan in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and begin to combat the consequential long-term and short-term effects of global warming on both the environment and on humans.
Impacts of Climate Change According to NASA:
- “Warming Oceans: The oceans have absorbed much of this increased heat, with the top 700 meters (about 2,300 feet) of ocean showing warming of more than 0.4 degrees Fahrenheit since 1969.
- “Shrinking Ice Sheets: The Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets have decreased in mass. Data from NASA’s Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment show Greenland lost an average of 286 billion tons of ice per year between 1993 and 2016, while Antarctica lost about 127 billion tons of ice per year during the same time period. The rate of Antarctica ice mass loss has tripled in the last decade.
- “Glacier Retreat: Glaciers are retreating almost everywhere around the world – including in the Alps, Himalayas, Andes, Rockies, Alaska, and Africa.
- “Sea Level Rise: Global sea level rose about 8 inches in the last century. The rate in the last two decades, however, is nearly double that of the last century and is accelerating slightly every year.
- “Extreme Events: The number of record high temperature events in the United States has been increasing, while the number of record low temperature events has been decreasing, since 1950. The U.S. has also witnessed increasing numbers of intense rainfall events.”
THE BIDEN PLAN FOR A CLEAN ENERGY REVOLUTION AND ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE
I. ENSURE THE U.S. ACHIEVES A 100% CLEAN ENERGY ECONOMY AND NET-ZERO EMISSIONS NO LATER THAN 2050
The United States must have a bold plan to achieve a 100% clean energy economy and net-zero emissions no later than 2050 here at home. On day one, Biden will sign a series of executive orders that put us on this track. And, he will demand that Congress enacts legislation in the first year of his presidency that 1) establishes an enforcement mechanism to achieve the 2050 goal, including a target no later than the end of his first term in 2025 to ensure we get to the finish line, 2) makes a historic investment in energy and climate research and innovation, 3) incentivizes the rapid deployment of clean energy innovations across the economy. Failure is not an option. If Congress falls short of its duty to act, Biden will hold them accountable.
Biden’s Day One Unprecedented Executive Actions to Drive Historic Progress
On day one, Biden will use the full authority of the executive branch to make progress and significantly reduce emissions. Biden recognizes we must go further, faster and more aggressively than ever before, by:
- Requiring aggressive methane pollution limits for new and existing oil and gas operations.
- Using the Federal government procurement system – which spends $500 billion every year – to drive towards 100% clean energy and zero-emissions vehicles.
- Ensuring that all U.S. government installations, buildings, and facilities are more efficient and climate-ready, harnessing the purchasing power and supply chains to drive innovation.
- Reducing greenhouse gas emissions from transportation – the fastest growing source of U.S. climate pollution – by preserving and implementing the existing Clean Air Act, and developing rigorous new fuel economy standards aimed at ensuring 100% of new sales for light- and medium-duty vehicles will be electrified and annual improvements for heavy duty vehicles.
- Doubling down on the liquid fuels of the future, which make agriculture a key part of the solution to climate change. Advanced biofuels are now closer than ever as we begin to build the first plants for biofuels, creating jobs and new solutions to reduce emissions in planes, ocean-going vessels, and more.
- Saving consumers money and reduce emissions through new, aggressive appliance- and building-efficiency standards.
- Committing that every federal infrastructure investment should reduce climate pollution, and require any federal permitting decision to consider the effects of greenhouse gas emissions and climate change.
- Requiring public companies to disclose climate risks and the greenhouse gas emissions in their operations and supply chains.
- Protecting biodiversity, slowing extinction rates and helping leverage natural climate solutions by conserving 30% of America’s lands and waters by 2030.
- Protecting America’s natural treasures by permanently protecting the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and other areas impacted by President Trump’s attack on federal lands and waters, establishing national parks and monuments that reflect America’s natural heritage, banning new oil and gas permitting on public lands and waters, modifying royalties to account for climate costs, and establishing targeted programs to enhance reforestation and develop renewables on federal lands and waters with the goal of doubling offshore wind by 2030.
Biden’s Year One Legislative Agenda on Climate Change
Establish an enforcement mechanism to achieve net-zero emissions no later than 2050, including a target no later than the end of Biden’s first term in 2025 to ensure we get to the finish line. This enforcement mechanism will be based on the principles that polluters must bear the full cost of the carbon pollution they are emitting and that our economy must achieve ambitious reductions in emissions economy-wide instead of having just a few sectors carry the burden of change. The enforcement mechanism will achieve clear, legally-binding emissions reductions with environmental integrity.
Make a historic investment in energy and climate research and innovation, as well as clean and resilient infrastructure and communities.
Notwithstanding the progress we have made in reducing emissions in the power sector, fossil fuels still comprise nearly 80% of global energy use. There is much more work to be done to identify affordable solutions. Today, we are on the cusp of breakthroughs in technologies, such as batteries that can more efficiently store energy for use at moments of peak demand, more efficient controls and sensors for advanced manufacturing, more effective and thinner insulation for buildings, and cybersecurity improvements to make smart grids more resilient to attacks.
We have to get rid of the old way of thinking that the clean economy and jobs don’t go together. They do. There are currently more than three million people in the United States employed in the clean energy economy. But, there is a huge opportunity to revitalize the U.S. energy sector, boost growth economy-wide, and re-claim the mantle as the world’s clean energy leader and top exporter. And, Joe Biden will ensure that clean economy jobs are good jobs.
To accelerate this progress, Biden will make the largest-ever investment in clean energy research and innovation. After World War II, public investment in research and collaboration between universities and the private sector spurred American innovation, led to rapid economic and job growth, and helped build a strong middle class. The Biden plan will double down on this approach to create the industries of the future by investing $400 billion over ten years. That’s twice the investment of the Apollo program which put a man on the moon, in today’s dollars. This investment will enable us to develop new technological break-throughs that will create jobs and drastically reduce emissions.
- Bring together America’s top talent to innovate on climate. America – with the leadership of government – has led the way on many technologies and innovations, from the GPS to computer networking. Biden will establish ARPA-C, a new, cross-agency Advanced Research Projects Agency focused on climate. This initiative will target affordable, game-changing technologies to help America achieve our 100% clean energy target, with a specific focus on the following, as recommended by the founding director of ARPA-E:grid-scale storage at one-tenth the cost of lithium-ion batteries;small modular nuclear reactors at half the construction cost of today’s reactors;refrigeration and air conditioning using refrigerants with no global warming potential;zero net energy buildings at zero net cost;using renewables to produce carbon-free hydrogen at the same cost as that from shale gas;decarbonizing industrial heat needed to make steel, concrete, and chemicals and reimagining carbon-neutral construction materials;decarbonizing the food and agriculture sector, and leveraging agriculture to remove carbon dioxide from the air and store it in the ground; andcapturing carbon dioxide from power plant exhausts followed by sequestering it deep underground or using it make alternative products.
- Target airline emissions: Aviation accounts for nearly 2% of global greenhouse gas emissions, and that portion is expected to increase. Unfortunately today, few low-carbon technologies or fuels have been developed to tackle this challenge. Biden recognizes that must change and will pursue measures to incentivize the creation of new, sustainable fuels for aircraft, as well as other changes to aircraft technology and standards, and air traffic management.
- Accelerate the development and deployment of carbon capture sequestration technology. According to the Blue Green Alliance, “carbon capture, use, and storage (CCUS) is a rapidly growing technology that has the potential to create economic benefits for multiple industries while significantly reducing carbon dioxide emissions.” Biden shares the Carbon Capture Coalition’s goal “to make CCUS a widely available, cost-effective, and rapidly scalable solution to reduce carbon emissions to meet mid-century climate goals.” Toward this end, he will double down on federal investments and enhance tax incentives for CCUS. At the same time, to bring new carbon capture technologies to market, Biden will continue to fund carbon capture research, development, and demonstration.
- Identify the future of nuclear energy. To address the climate emergency threatening our communities, economy, and national security, we must look at all low- and zero-carbon technologies. That’s why Biden will support a research agenda through ARPA-C to look at issues, ranging from cost to safety to waste disposal systems, that remain an ongoing challenge with nuclear power today.
Incentivize the deployment of clean technology throughout our economy. Creating the best, most innovative clean technology in the world is not enough. We also need to make sure it is used by households and industry in order to achieve aggressive emissions reductions. Toward that end, Biden will incentivize clean technology deployment in the following ways:
- Improving the energy efficiency of our buildings. Building on his efforts in the Recovery Act, Biden will set a target of reducing the carbon footprint of the U.S. building stock 50% by 2035, creating incentives for deep retrofits that combine appliance electrification, efficiency, and on-site clean power generation. He will work to identify barriers to help offset the upfront cost of building upgrades and put in place a national program to target a package of affordable energy efficiency retrofits in American homes. He will direct the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to make housing for low-income communities more efficient. He will direct the U.S. Department of Energy to redouble efforts to accelerate new efficiency standards for household appliances and equipment. And, he will repair and accelerate the building code process and create a new funding mechanism for states and cities to adopt strict building codes and train builders and inspectors.
- Accelerating the deployment of electric vehicles. There are now one million electric vehicles on the road in the United States. But a key barrier to further deployment of these greenhouse-gas reducing vehicles is the lack of charging stations and coordination across all levels of government. As President, Biden will work with our nation’s governors and mayors to support the deployment of more than 500,000 new public charging outlets by the end of 2030. In addition, Biden will restore the full electric vehicle tax credit to incentivize the purchase of these vehicles. He will ensure the tax credit is designed to targeted middle class consumers and, to the greatest extent possible, to prioritize the purchase of vehicles made in America. And, he will work to develop a new fuel economy standard that goes beyond what the Obama-Biden Administration put in place.
- Empowering local communities to develop transportation solutions. Communities across the country are experiencing a growing need for alternative and cleaner transportation options, including transit, dedicated bicycle and pedestrian thoroughfares, and first- and last-mile connections. The Biden Administration will transform the way we fund local transportation, giving state and local governments, with input from community stakeholders, more flexibility to use any new transportation funds to build safer, cleaner, and more accessible transportation ecosystem.
- Partnering with farmers and ranchers so that better agriculture practices and deployment of digesters generate new sources of revenues. For our family farmers, ranchers, and landowners the climate agenda is not just about growing nutritious food and making it accessible to all families, it’s also about having water they can rely on for growing that food. It’s about local farms and fresh food for every community. And it’s about making sure that floodwaters in the Midwest are not taking away family farms that have fed our people for decades. Biden will review regulatory roadblocks to new innovations and invest in climate-friendly farming such as conservation programs for cover crops and other practices aimed at restoring the soil and building soil carbon, and in the process, preventing run-off and helping family farmers deploy the latest technologies to maximize productivity. He will create new opportunities to support deployment of methane digesters to capture potent climate emissions and generate electricity. With these efforts, family farmers can benefit and help lead the Clean Energy Revolution.
- Mitigating the climate impact of urban sprawl. Housing policy can be used as a tool to battle climate change and expand the middle class. Many lower- and middle-income Americans are forced to live far away from job centers due to high housing costs, leading not only to workers being overburdened by long commutes, but also to higher emissions associated with increased traffic and extra-long commuting times. Altering local regulations to eliminate sprawl and allow for denser, more affordable housing near public transit would cut commute times for many of the country’s workers while decreasing their carbon footprint. This means that emission-reduction strategies not only combat climate change but also save consumers money. Yet, many households often need support to afford the initial investment. Local housing authorities and utility companies have stepped up and helped households invest in energy-efficient upgrades by offering flexible financing plans and tax credits.
- Enacting a national strategy to develop a low-carbon manufacturing sector in every state, accelerating cutting-edge technologies and ensuring businesses and workers have access to new technologies and skills, with a major focus on helping small and large manufacturers upgrade their capabilities to have both competitive and low-carbon futures. The strategy will connect research universities, community colleges, incubators and accelerators, manufacturing institutes and employers, unions, and state and local governments – alone or as part of a regional pact – and provide them with significant funding for deployment of a place-based plan to help their state or region build a competitive and low-carbon future in manufacturing that reflects climate impacts in their local communities. Industries from textiles to machine tools to metal fabrication to the most advanced manufacturing technologies will be eligible for funding to modernize, compete, create jobs, and move to clean energy futures. Allocated tax credits and subsidies will be available for businesses to upgrade equipment and processes, invest in expanded or new factories, and deploy low-carbon technologies, as long as all stakeholders are part of the process of determining a bottom-line win for jobs, workers, clean energy, and long-term community investment. Where states feel competitive pressures or requirements in response to the climate emergency may threaten a local economy, Biden’s national strategy will fund efforts to move to a more competitive or low-carbon manufacturing approach that can preemptively develop new economic strategies, including deployment of federal funding for technologies or manufacturing innovation centers.
Harnessing Great Potential So America and Our Workers Lead the 21st Century Economy
Joe Biden knows that our response to this climate emergency also presents an opportunity. More than three million people in the United States are already employed in the clean energy economy. But, that is only the beginning of what is possible if we harness all of our talent and creativity. If executed strategically, our response to climate change can create more than 10 million well-paying jobs in the United States that will grow a stronger, more inclusive middle class enjoyed by communities across the country, not just in cities along the coasts.
America has a great opportunity to lead in the industries of the future by strengthening emerging industries in agriculture, clean energy, and advanced manufacturing. This also presents an opportunity for America to create stable, well-paying jobs that drive clean energy here at home and abroad.
That’s why Joe Biden will make the largest investment in history in American innovation – including research and innovation to unlock and deploy new zero-carbon technologies for the future, create stable well-paying jobs across the U.S., and make zero-carbon technologies the most cost-effective and scalable way to meet our country’s energy needs.
And, Joe Biden will ensure that clean economy jobs are good jobs. We must ensure jobs created as part of the clean energy revolution offer good wages, benefits, and worker protections. Toward this end, Biden will defend workers’ rights to form unions and collectively bargain in these emerging and growing industries; pursue new partnerships with community colleges, unions, and the private sector to develop programs to train all of America’s workforce to tap into the growing clean energy economy; incorporate skills training into infrastructure investment planning by engaging state and local communities; and reinvigorate and repurpose AmeriCorps for sustainability, so that every American can participate in the clean energy economy. These efforts will be worker-centered and driven in collaboration with the communities they will affect.
Unfortunately, today the Trump Administration is allowing America to fall behind in the clean energy race for the future. In 2017, China invested $3 in renewable energy for every $1 in America, giving China an edge on the technologies of tomorrow that will generate well-paying jobs. By 2030, the Biden Administration will put the United States back in the driver’s seat, making America the world’s leader in clean energy research, investment, commercialization, manufacturing, and exports..
II. BUILD A STRONGER MORE, RESILIENT NATION
The country is already experiencing the impact of climate change in diverse and varied communities across the nation. As the Trump Administration has abdicated leadership, America’s mayors and other local leaders have stepped up to build smarter cities that can withstand storms, floods, urban heat, and wildfire as well as sea level rise and so much more. A Biden Administration will once again give local leaders a true partner in the White House, enhancing their efforts and creating well-paying jobs to improve climate resiliency and invest in our economic future.
Infrastructure is critical to economic growth. One International Monetary Fund study found that increasing infrastructure investment by 1% of GDP in advanced countries can raise growth by 0.4% to 1.5% and foster technological innovation. Joe Biden believes that this investment is essential and that, as we take long overdue steps to improve crumbling infrastructure, we must also prioritize achieving deep emission reductions. To that end, Biden will commit that every infrastructure investment that receives federal funding should reduce climate pollution, as much as possible. Climate impacts are regional, and the solutions will be too.
As part of the Clean Energy Revolution legislative package, Biden will make groundbreaking investments in clean and resilient infrastructure and communities. In addition, Biden will:
- Define the climate adaptation agenda. Biden will bring together the best innovators to help design common-sense zoning and building codes and help communities build and rebuild before and after natural disasters and other shocks and stresses.
- Develop new tools to manage and reduce risk and the cost of transferring risk. Working with the insurance industry, the Biden Administration will identify ways to lower property insurance premiums for homeowners and communities who invest in resilience, expanding programs like the Community Rating System that FEMA currently administers across the country.
- Build a new resilient infrastructure economy. Biden will create a new class of well-paying jobs and job training around climate resilient industries. Coastal restoration, resilient infrastructure design, construction and evaluation (such as bridges that withstand high winds and roads that don’t wash out during storms and floods), natural solutions (such as tree plantings on a large scale to combat urban heat and its associated negative health impacts), and technological solutions to easily assess risk and protect people and their property are all proven to improve the resilience of communities. They are also opportunities for job growth and economic vitality all over the country.
- Spark the second great railroad revolution. Two centuries ago, the first great railroad expansion drove our industrial revolution. Today, the U.S. is lagging behind Europe and China in rail safety and speed. Biden will develop a plan to ensure that America has the cleanest, safest, and fastest rail system in the world – for both passengers and freight.With respect to passenger rail: He’ll start by putting the Northeast Corridor on higher speeds and shrinking the travel time from D.C. to New York by half – and build in conjunction with it a new, safer Hudson River Tunnel. He will make progress toward the completion of the California High Speed Rail project. He will expand the Northeast Corridor to the fast-growing South. Across the Midwest and the Great West, he will begin the construction of an end-to-end high speed rail system that will connect the coasts, unlocking new, affordable access for every American.With respect to freight: A Biden Administration will pursue projects like a bridge that connects Oregon and Washington State that moves not only trucks but rail transit, and the completion of the CREATE project in Chicago that could cut in half the time it takes vital goods to move through the country. This plan will reduce pollution, help connect workers to quality jobs with shorter commutes, and spur investment in communities more efficiently connected to major metropolitan areas.
American States and Cities: Leading by Example
In the void left by the Trump Administration’s inaction, American governors and mayors have set ambitious goals and implemented large-scale programs to address climate change. Their efforts also bolster local economies: The Bureau of Labor Statistics forecasts solar installers and wind turbine technicians to be the two fastest growing occupations through 2026 (with 105% and 96% growth, respectively). Local efforts include:
- New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham pledged to reduce statewide greenhouse gas emissions by 45% by 2030; New Mexico is currently the country’s third-largest producer of oil.
- Colorado Governor Jared Polis committed his state to 100% clean electricity by 2040; he signed an executive order to move the state to zero-emission vehicle standards and increase adoption of electric vehicles.
- Oregon lawmakers have introduced a carbon cap and trade proposal that would set a 52 million metric ton cap on greenhouse gas emissions. This follows California’s own cap and trade system and that of nine northeast states (Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Rhode Island, and Vermont) which comprise the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative.
- Twenty-nine states, three territories, and Washington D.C., have adopted Renewable Portfolio Standards which mandate a specified portion of the electricity that utilities sell come from renewable resources.
- Cities have taken the lead too: over 35 cities set a goal of 80% emissions reductions by 2050 and over 400 mayors honor the Paris Agreement. Cities are creatively tackling this problem including by implementing energy taxes that reduce emissions (Boulder, CO), electrifying public transit (e.g., Los Angeles), and pledging all municipal electricity be generated by carbon-free sources by 2020 (e.g., Kansas City, MO).
These states and cities deserve to once again have a partner in the White House. Biden will be that partner.
III. RALLY THE REST OF THE WORLD TO ADDRESS THE GRAVE CLIMATE THREAT
The United States accounts for only 15% of global emissions, so we know we cannot solve this emergency on our own. Climate change is a global challenge that requires decisive action from every country around the world. That’s why the Obama-Biden Administration mobilized the world to achieve the 2015 Paris Climate Accord.
Biden will rejoin the Paris Agreement, but simply rejoining is not enough. Biden will use every tool of American foreign policy to push the rest of the world to raise their ambitions alongside the United States. A Biden Administration will:
Re-enter the Paris Agreement on day one of the Biden Administration and lead a major diplomatic push to raise the ambitions of countries’ climate targets. The Paris Agreement was a historic breakthrough for the world, and reflected the power of patient, strategic diplomacy in service of America’s long-term national interests. The core of the agreement relies on countries continually increasing the ambition of their climate targets over time. But since President Trump came into office, America has abdicated its own commitment to this agreement, and other major emitting nations have not moved fast enough to achieve their own goals. This means that re-entering Paris on day one of the Biden Administration is only the first step of an important and sustained effort to dramatically increase global climate ambition. Biden was there alongside President Obama to rally the world to get to Paris; and he will be prepared on day one of his presidency to take it to the next level. To catalyze this effort, Biden will, in his first 100 days in office:
- Convene a climate world summit to directly engage the leaders of the major carbon-emitting nations of the world to persuade them to join the United States in making more ambitious national pledges, above and beyond the commitments they have already made.
- Lead the world to lock in enforceable international agreements to reduce emissions in global shipping and aviation.
- Embrace the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol, adding momentum to curbing hydrofluorocarbons, an especially potent greenhouse gas, which could deliver a 0.5 degree Celsius reduction in global warming by mid-century.
Pursue strong new measures to stop other countries from cheating on their climate commitments. We can no longer separate trade policy from our climate objectives. Biden will not allow other nations, including China, to game the system by becoming destination economies for polluters, undermining our climate efforts and exploiting American workers and businesses. As the U.S. takes steps to make domestic polluters bear the full cost of their carbon pollution, the Biden Administration will impose carbon adjustment fees or quotas on carbon-intensive goods from countries that are failing to meet their climate and environmental obligations. This will ensure that American workers and their employers are not at a competitive disadvantage and simultaneously encourage other nations to raise their climate ambitions. Biden will also condition future trade agreements on partners’ commitments to meet their enhanced Paris climate targets.
Stop China from subsidizing coal exports and outsourcing carbon pollution. China is far and away the largest emitter of carbon in the world, and through its massive Belt and Road Initiative, Beijing is also annually financing billions of dollars of dirty fossil fuel energy projects across Asia and beyond. Biden will rally a united front of nations to hold China accountable to high environmental standards in its Belt and Road Initiative infrastructure projects, so that China can’t outsource pollution to other countries. Specifically, the U.S. will:
- Make future bilateral U.S.-China agreements on carbon mitigation – like the 2014 agreement that paved the way for the Paris accord – contingent on China eliminating unjustified export subsidies for coal and other high-emissions technologies and making verifiable progress in reducing the carbon footprint of projects connected to the Belt and Road Initiative.
- Seek a G20 commitment to end all export finance subsidies of high-carbon projects, building on past commitments from the G7 and multilateral export finance institutions to eliminate financing for coal in all but the poorest countries.
- With our partners, offer Belt and Road Initiative countries alternative sources of development financing for lower-carbon energy investments.
- Reform the International Monetary Fund and regional development bank standards on debt repayment priorities for development projects. The U.S. will lead like-minded nations to establish rules that take unsustainable climate and debt costs – such as those imposed by self-interested Chinese projects – into account in prioritizing who gets paid under international debt forbearance. Projects with high carbon impact and high debt costs will go to the end of the line, making them higher risk and more costly.
Demand a worldwide ban on fossil fuel subsidies. There is simply no excuse for subsidizing fossil fuel, either in the United States or around the world. In fact, a 2015 International Monetary Fund study showed that efficient fossil fuel pricing would have reduced global carbon emissions by nearly 30%. Biden will build on the achievements of the Obama-Biden Administration to get G20 countries to phase out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies. By engaging key leaders, including in China, Biden will secure a global commitment to eliminate fossil fuel subsidies by the end of his first term. He will lead by example, with the United States cutting fossil fuel subsidies at home in his first year and redirecting these resources to the historic investment in clean energy infrastructure (outlined in Part I of this plan).
Create a Clean Energy Export and Climate Investment Initiative. This is also a moment of opportunity for American innovation. We can be the world’s clean energy superpower. Biden will establish a new government-wide effort to promote American clean energy exports and investments around the world to advance climate mitigation, adaptation, and resilience. The initiative will offer incentives for U.S. firms that supply low-carbon solutions to the international market in order to spur U.S. industry, jobs, and competitiveness, and make America the world leader in clean energy technologies. It will prioritize partnerships with countries that make high climate ambition commitments under Paris and provide low-cost financing to these countries for American clean energy exports. An initial focus will be small island states in the Pacific and Caribbean that are demonstrating climate leadership in the face of existential threats to their territorial homelands.
No financing dirty energy. Biden will ensure the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC), the Export-Import Bank, and the new U.S. International Development Finance Corporation significantly reduce the carbon footprints of their portfolios. For example, these agencies will be prohibited from any financing for coal-fired power plants so that U.S. finance is no longer a dirtier alternative to the World Bank.
Meet America’s climate finance pledge and provide “green debt relief” for developing countries that make climate commitments. Biden will recommit the United States to the Green Climate Fund, fulfilling America’s pledge and enhancing our security by helping developing countries better manage the adverse effects of climate change, including conflict, migration, and state fragility. The U.S. will also work with international financial institutions to pursue shared debt relief for countries provided that they use those funds for climate-friendly development.
Catalyze Global Clean Energy Research. In 2015, the Obama-Biden Administration launched Mission Innovation, a global initiative of 23 countries and the European Union focused on research, development, and deployment of potential breakthrough technologies to accelerate clean energy innovation. Yet the U.S. has stepped back from this partnership even as the science has reinforced the urgency of the climate emergency. Biden will work with participating countries to reset the effort on a more ambitious track – beginning with a commitment to invest four times the originally-committed financial resources, which will help support research and development and unleash innovation at universities and research institutions around the world. Biden will also work to establish performance-based goals with tangible research and development outcomes; improve data collection and transparency to better track progress and improve accountability; enhance cooperation with private sector entrepreneurs; and help other countries build their institutional R&D capabilities to ensure increased funding is spent most effectively.
Name and shame global climate outlaws. The U.S. Department of State publishes rankings of country’s records on human trafficking and human rights. A Biden Administration will institute a new Global Climate Change Report to hold countries to account for meeting, or failing to meet, their Paris commitments and for other steps that promote or undermine global climate solutions.
Pursue a global moratorium on offshore drilling in the Arctic and reestablish climate change as a priority for the Arctic Council. The Arctic poses profound national security challenges as its physical make-up changes due to extreme warming in the Arctic region. Yet, the Trump Administration has refused to allow the Arctic Council to even use the words “climate change.” Biden will elevate climate change to the top of the priority list for the Council, and focus on reducing two short-lived but highly potent pollutants, black carbon and methane. He will not only re-establish the U.S. commitment to remove Arctic waters from consideration for oil and gas leasing, he will also work with Arctic Council member nations to extend this moratorium globally. And, he will use the Arctic Council to put a spotlight on Russia’s activities in the Arctic, standing firm with council partners to hold Russia accountable for any efforts to further militarize the region.
Strengthen collaboration and ambition in the Americas. In our own hemisphere, the effects of climate change are already undermining security and prosperity, as well as driving increased migration. The Inter-American Development Bank estimates that projected damages to the region from droughts, floods, sea level rise, and other climate impacts associated with an increase in global temperature of 2 degrees Celsius will cost approximately $100 billion per year by 2050. But, the climate emergency also presents an enormous opportunity for the region to leapfrog dirty development in favor of the technologies of the future. Investments in clean energy and resilient and sustainable infrastructure will drive an innovation boom that helps us achieve the vision of a hemisphere that is secure, middle class, and democratic from Canada to Chile. Biden will work with countries throughout our region to develop a comprehensive strategy that meets these challenges and seizes these opportunities. This strategy will include:
- A framework to limit greenhouse gas emissions related to land use, forests, and agriculture.
- New common standards for the greening of manufacturing, mining, and tourism.
- Major investments in clean-energy technologies.
- A more integrated energy grid from Mexico through Central America and Colombia supplied by increasingly clean energy.
- A special focus on the Caribbean and the Northern Triangle of Central America to promote transitions to clean energy as well as climate change adaptation and resilience. Caribbean islands are particularly vulnerable to rising sea levels and more severe weather patterns, including hurricanes, and sustained drought in places like eastern Guatemala is causing more people to flee in search of better opportunities.
Make climate change a core national security priority. Climate change is a “threat multiplier” that magnifies existing geopolitical and weather-related risks. To address our defense and intelligence leaders’ warnings about the threats climate change poses to global stability and security, Biden will elevate climate change as a national security priority. Specifically, he will:
- Commission a National Intelligence Estimate on national and economic security impacts from climate change, including water scarcity, increased risks of conflict, impacts on state fragility, and the security implications of resulting large-scale migrations.
- Direct the Secretary of Defense and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to report to him annually on the impacts of climate change on defense posture, readiness, infrastructure, and threat picture, as well as the Defense Department’s strategy to manage those impacts.
- Direct the National Security Advisor, working with the Secretaries of Defense, State, Homeland Security, and others, to develop a comprehensive strategy to address the security implications of climate change.
- Invest in the climate resilience of our military bases and critical security infrastructure across the U.S. and around the world, to deal with the risk of climate change effects, including extreme weather events that caused over $8 billion in damages to Department of Defense bases in just the last year. Biden will direct the Secretaries of Defense and Energy to develop specific inventories of the most acute vulnerabilities in our critical infrastructure due to climate change, and prioritize upgrades, hardening, and resilience investments to mitigate them.
Climate Change Poses Serious Risks to U.S. National Security
President Trump has not only reversed America’s progress on climate change, he has also ignored his own defense and intelligence leaders’ warnings about the threats that climate change poses to global stability and security. These risks range from direct threats to physical military assets to more indirect effects like regional destabilization.
- In a January 2019 report to Congress, the Department of Defense stated: “The effects of a changing climate are a national security issue with potential impacts to [DOD] missions, operational plans, and installations.” The report assessed 79 installations that it deemed mission critical, and concluded that over the next two decades, 53 of the 79 faced threats from flooding, 43 face threats from drought, and 36 face wildfire threat. Former Secretary of Defense Mattis stated in his confirmation proceedings that “climate change is impacting stability in areas of the world where our troops are operating today…it can be a driver of instability and the Department of Defense must pay attention to potential adverse impacts generated by this phenomenon.”
- Just this past January, the Director of National Intelligence told Congress: “Global environmental and ecological degradation, as well as climate change, are likely to fuel competition for resources, economic distress, and social discontent through 2019 and beyond.. Damage to communication, energy, and transportation infrastructure could affect low-lying military bases, inflict economic costs, and cause human displacement and loss of life.”
- Climate change will lead to higher levels of regional instability. For example, rising sea levels on Africa’s eastern coast could imperil large cities and require more US military-supported disaster relief activities. Further, deteriorating economic conditions in climate-impacted areas could increase piracy and terrorist activity, requiring a US military response.
- The Arctic Ocean will become more accessible to maritime trade and oil/gas extraction, increasing the risk of the region’s militarization and Russian and Chinese influence.
- Rising sea levels and related storm surges may result in the closure of at-risk military installations. Further, increasingly intense hurricanes cause structural damage to bases. For example, Hurricane Michael prevented Air Force Base Tyndall from resuming normal operations for nearly a month, affecting nearly one-third of the country’s F-22s.
- Droughts negatively affect military operations by reducing water supply, delaying training activities, and increasing the rate of heat-related illnesses among soldiers. Within the US, the risk of drought is particularly high in the Southwest.
- Thawing permafrost can impede military training exercises in areas like Alaska.
IV. STAND UP TO THE ABUSE OF POWER BY POLLUTERS WHO DISPROPORTIONATELY HARM COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND LOW-INCOME COMMUNITIES
Everyone is already feeling the effects of climate change. But the impacts – on health, economics, and overall quality of life – are far more acute on communities of color, tribal lands, and low-income communities. “Climate change does not affect everyone equally in the United States,” according to Rachel Morello-Frosch, lead author of The Climate Gap. “People of color and the poor will be hurt the most – unless elected officials and other policymakers intervene.”
We cannot turn a blind eye to the way in which environmental burdens and benefits have been and will continue to be distributed unevenly along racial and socioeconomic lines – not just with respect to climate change, but also pollution of our air, water, and land. The evidence of these disproportionate harms is clear. According to the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America, African Americans are almost 3 times more likely to die from asthma related causes than their white counterparts. And, nearly 1 in 2 of Latinos in the US live in counties where the air doesn’t meet EPA public health standards for smog according to Green Latinos. And according to the U.S. Federal Government, 40% of the 567 federally recognized tribes in U.S. live in Alaska where the rapid pace of rising temperatures and melting sea ice and glaciers threaten the critical infrastructure and traditional livelihoods in the state. Biden will reinstate federal protections, rolled back by the Trump Administration, that were designed to protect communities. He will make it a priority for all agencies to engage in community-driven approaches to develop solutions for environmental injustices affecting communities of color, low-income, and indigenous communities.
In addition, he will:
Hold polluters accountable. Under the Trump Administration, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has referred the fewest number of criminal anti-pollution cases to the Justice Department in 30 years. Allowing corporations to continue to pollute – affecting the health and safety of both their workers and surrounding communities – without consequences perpetuates an egregious abuse of power. Biden will direct his EPA and Justice Department to pursue these cases to the fullest extent permitted by law and, when needed, seek additional legislation as needed to hold corporate executives personally accountable – including jail time where merited.
Ensure access to safe drinking water for all communities. Communities across America are experiencing a water crisis, in water infrastructure, contamination, accessibility and so much more. Here in the U.S., from rural areas to cities, from Flint, Michigan to Merrimack, New Hampshire to Martin County, Kentucky, many Americans cannot safely drink their tap water. In much of the southwest and west, the problem is a lack of sufficient water, expected to exacerbate with a changing climate. Biden will make water infrastructure a top priority, for example, by establishing systems to monitor lead and other contaminants in our water supply and take necessary action to eliminate health risks, including holding polluters accountable and support communities in upgrading their systems.
Safe and Clean Water for All Americans
We can all agree that threats to our water system are threats to our quality of life. Americans watched in horror when residents, especially children, of Flint had dirty, foul water that tested with high levels of lead. But in fact, water challenges exist throughout the nation, from access to clean drinking water and upgrading aged municipal infrastructure to our ports, from recreation to ocean plastics, from oil spills and run-off to the energy-water nexus and green infrastructure, our waters and our public health faces interrelated challenges and opportunities everywhere in our nation.
A study by the National Academy of Sciences found that 3 to 10% of Americans live in areas where water quality is subpar – often due to aging infrastructure that needs to be updated or replaced.
According to American Rivers, “the average American sewage pipe is 33 years old, with many pipes dating back 50 or even 100 years.” The group notes that aging infrastructure also leads to greater storm water runoff and sewer overflows – and heavy storms can super-saturate the system, resulting in raw sewage and polluted stormwater contaminating nearby streams and rivers.
Other places have a scarcity of water. For example, some researchers believe that Lake Meade which supplies water to 21 million Americans will be dry by 2021. And, according to American Rivers, reservoirs on the Colorado River already lose 1.8 million acre-feet of water to evaporation in an average year, about 13%of the river’s annual flow.
More frequent and more powerful storms will result in an increase in polluted runoff from urban and rural areas, sending pollutants from the landscape into nearby waterways. The threat is even more dire in communities with aging infrastructure where one pipe carries stormwater and sewage together; heavy storms can overwhelm the system, resulting in raw sewage and polluted stormwater entering into nearby streams and rivers.
Communities must upgrade aging infrastructure, or they will experience greater increases in stormwater runoff and sewer overflows.
Our water challenges vary by region:
The Midwest: The recent increase in flooding is directly related to the intensification of rainfall. Combined with increased amounts of rain, impacts on the Great Lakes – home to 80% of the nation’s fresh water – exacerbates existing water-related issues in communities throughout the Midwest, such as the proliferation of PFAS, invasive species such as the Asian Carp and algae blooms in Toledo.
Southeast/Gulf Coasts: Tropical and coastal storms, including hurricanes are becoming more devastating.
Eastern Seaboard, Gulf Coast: Rising sea level threatens coastal lives and property, and causes coastal aquifers to become salty and unusable.
Southwestern U.S.: Warmer temperatures are combining with reduced precipitation to drive water loss from the region’s reservoirs and from the land surface. Intensified, hotter, drought is already impacting the region’s forests, with widespread tree death, diseases, and forest fires reshaping iconic ecosystems.
Western U.S.: The West is warming faster than much of the rest of the lower 48, and this has particular impacts on water and makes it easier for fires to start and spread. As a result of the warming climate: more precipitation falls as rain, rather than snow; there is less snow accumulation in the mountains, and snow melts faster in the spring because of the warmer temperatures and increased rainfall.
The Northwest: In addition to the sea level and hydrological impacts listed above, the Northwest is vulnerable to changes in the ocean. Adding CO2 to the atmosphere acidifies the ocean, and as climate warms, the ocean holds less oxygen.
Alaska: The Arctic is warming faster than anywhere else on the planet, because the melting of sea ice sets additional warming in motion which accelerates the melting in a self-reinforcing and amplifying cycle. Alaska is the fastest-warming U.S. state. Warmer temperatures are melting permafrost, creating sinkholes and erosion that damages buildings, roads, and pipelines.
Hawaii: Hawaii is strongly impacted by ocean changes. Sea level rise is beginning to threaten coastal resources, including structures, roads, cultural sites, beaches, and key infrastructure. A recent report estimated that a 1m sea level rise would cost the state 19 billion just for structures and flooded land – and ten times that for the associated damage to roads and other infrastructure, loss of visitors, and impacts to natural resources.
Ensure that communities harmed by climate change and pollution are the first to benefit from the Clean Economy Revolution. Low-income communities and communities of color don’t equally share in the benefits of well-paying job opportunities that result from our clean energy economy. For example, African Americans hold only 1% of energy jobs. As President, Biden will make sure these communities receive preference in competitive grant programs in the Clean Economy Revolution.
People of Color and Low-Income Communities Are at Especially High Risk
From Climate Change and Pollution
- People of color and low-income communities are more likely to live in areas most vulnerable to flooding and other climate change-related weather events. They are also less likely to have the funds to prepare for and recover from extreme weather. In the wake of Hurricane Harvey, black and Hispanic residents were twice as likely as non-Hispanic white individuals to report experiencing an income shock and lack of recovery support.
- African American children living in poverty are more likely than wealthier white children to live in a community that borders toxic chemical facilities. Extreme weather can increase the health risks of being co-located with these toxic structures.
- Failure to reduce emissions disproportionately hurts black and Hispanic residents who experience 37% higher exposure to nitrogen dioxide (a toxic pollutant) compared to non-Hispanic whites. This leads to an increased rate of premature death due to heart disease.
- Resiliency investments can raise property values and push lower-income families out of their neighborhoods. Climate change mitigation efforts must consciously protect low-income communities from “green gentrification.”
- Climate change poses particular threats to indigenous tribes given that approximately 1.1 million American Indians and Alaska Natives live on or near reservations or native land in the Northwest, Southwest, Alaska, and Great Plains.
V. FULFILL OUR OBLIGATION TO WORKERS AND COMMUNITIES WHO POWERED OUR INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION AND DECADES OF ECONOMIC GROWTH
Biden will commit our country to fulfilling our obligation to all workers impacted by the energy transition, like coal miners and power plant workers and their communities. Coal miners and power plant workers took on dangerous jobs to power our industrial revolution and the decades of subsequent economic growth. As economic trends continue to shift our country away from coal as an energy source, we have an obligation to help these workers and their communities succeed.
Biden will:
Secure the benefits coal miners and their families have earned. As marketplace competition continues to shift the country away from coal-fired electricity, we have an obligation to these workers who’ve worked hard and sacrificed for the rest of us. Biden will make sure coal miners and their families receive not only the respect they deserve but also the pensions and health benefits they have been promised. Congress should do the right thing and pass legislation now to protect the retirement benefits owed to miners, their dependents, and their widows. But if Congress doesn’t act before Biden takes office, he will make sure we fulfill this obligation. And, Biden will increase coal companies’ payments into the black lung benefits program, reform the black lung benefits system so it is no longer rigged in favor of coal companies who can hire lawyers and doctors to ensure miners’ benefits are denied, expand efforts to help miners detect black lung cases earlier and access care, and enforce regulations to reduce cases of black lung in the first place.
Invest in coal and power plant communities and other communities impacted by the climate transformation. Each of these communities are necessary. We can’t write them off or act like they don’t matter. Each has assets that can be leveraged to diversify their economies, create good, middle class jobs, and help the country get stronger – assets like a rich culture, natural beauty, a proven workforce, and entrepreneurial spirit. The federal government should be a partner to help these communities capitalize on these strengths and build vibrant communities where good jobs are available and young people want to stay or return home. To support coal and power plant workers and their communities, Biden will make an unprecedented investment building upon the vision put forward in the Obama-Biden Administration’s Power+ Plan. And, he’ll establish a Task Force on Coal and Power Plant Communities, as the Obama-Biden Administration did for Detroit when the auto industry was in turmoil. For example, the Task Force will help these communities access federal investments and leverage private sector investments to help create high-paying union jobs based upon the unique assets of each community, partner with unions and community colleges to create training opportunities for these new jobs, repair infrastructure, keep public employees like firefighters and teachers on the payroll, and keep local hospitals open.
Obama-Biden Administration Record
The Obama-Biden Administration kick-started a new era of American leadership in renewable energy by making significant investments in clean energy technology and promulgating regulations to curb carbon emissions.
- Included in the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act more than $90 billion and leveraged $150 billion of private and local spending for clean energy investments.
- Increased the share of domestically-produced wind turbine components made in the US from 35% in 2006-2007 to 67% in 2011 and a dramatic plunge in solar costs helping it get closer to grid parity (i.e., lower cost than traditional energy sources).
- Jump-started the Department of Energy’s Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) program which invested in 475 transformative energy technologies and secured $1.25 billion in private sector follow-on funding for related projects.
- Helped lead and sign the Paris Climate Agreement, setting the world on a path toward a sustainable future.
- Set bold corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards requiring a 54.5 miles-per-gallon standard for cars and light-duty trucks by model year 2025, which the National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration predicted: “[would save] consumers more than $1.7 trillion in gas costs and [reduce] U.S. oil consumption by 12 billion barrels.”
- Implemented first-ever medium- and heavy-duty fuel efficiency standards projected to save nearly $170 billion in fuel costs.
- Implemented energy efficiency standards for buildings, homes and appliances, with a particular focus on saving consumers money on heating and cooling bills; in the Administration’s first term the Department of Energy and Department of Housing and Urban Development completed energy efficiency upgrades in more than 1 million homes, saving families more than $400 each on average.
- Expanded or established protections for more than 550 million acres of federal lands and waters and banned drilling in large parts of the Atlantic and Arctic Oceans.
- Helped create more resilient infrastructure that can withstand climate change; a 2013 Executive Order also required federal agencies to release climate change adaptation plans to plan for the adverse impacts of more extreme weather and rising sea-levels. .

- National Geographic - Science - Cretaceous Period
Cretaceous Period, in geologic time, the last of the three periods of the Mesozoic Era. The Cretaceous began 145.0 million years ago and ended 66 million years ago; it followed the Jurassic Period and was succeeded by the Paleogene Period (the first of the two periods into which the Tertiary Period was divided). The Cretaceous is the longest period of the Phanerozoic Eon. Spanning 79 million years, it represents more time than has elapsed since the extinction of the dinosaurs, which occurred at the end of the period.
The name Cretaceous is derived from creta, Latin for “chalk,” and was first proposed by J.B.J. Omalius d’Halloy in 1822. D’Halloy had been commissioned to make a geologic map of France, and part of his task was to decide upon the geologic units to be represented by it. One of his units, the Terrain Crétacé, included chalks and underlying sands. Chalk is a soft, fine-grained type of limestone composed predominantly of the armourlike plates of coccolithophores, tiny floating algae that flourished during the Late Cretaceous. Most Cretaceous rocks are not chalks, but most chalks were deposited during the Cretaceous. Many of these rocks provide clear and easily accessed details of the period because they have not been deformed or eroded and are relatively close to the surface—as can be seen in the white cliffs bordering the Strait of Dover between France and England.
The Cretaceous Period began with Earth’s land assembled essentially into two continents, Laurasia in the north and Gondwana in the south. These were almost completely separated by the equatorial Tethys seaway, and the various segments of Laurasia and Gondwana had already started to rift apart. North America had just begun pulling away from Eurasia during the Jurassic, and South America had started to split off from Africa, from which India, Australia, and Antarctica were also separating. When the Cretaceous Period ended, most of the present-day continents were separated from each other by expanses of water such as the North and South Atlantic Ocean. At the end of the period, India was adrift in the Indian Ocean, and Australia was still connected to Antarctica.
The climate was generally warmer and more humid than today, probably because of very active volcanism associated with unusually high rates of seafloor spreading. The polar regions were free of continental ice sheets, their land instead covered by forest. Dinosaurs roamed Antarctica, even with its long winter night.
The lengthy Cretaceous Period constitutes a major portion of the interval between ancient life-forms and those that dominate Earth today. Dinosaurs were the dominant group of land animals, especially “duck-billed” dinosaurs (hadrosaurs), such as Shantungosaurus, and horned forms, such as Triceratops. Giant marine reptiles such as ichthyosaurs, mosasaurs, and plesiosaurs were common in the seas, and flying reptiles (pterosaurs) dominated the sky. Flowering plants (angiosperms) arose close to the beginning of the Cretaceous and became more abundant as the period progressed. The Late Cretaceous was a time of great productivity in the world’s oceans, as borne out by the deposition of thick beds of chalk in western Europe, eastern Russia, southern Scandinavia, the Gulf Coast of North America, and western Australia. The Cretaceous ended with one of the greatest mass extinctions in the history of Earth, exterminating the dinosaurs, marine and flying reptiles, and many marine invertebrates.
The Cretaceous environment
Paleogeography
The position of Earth’s landmasses changed significantly during the Cretaceous Period—not unexpected, given its long duration. At the onset of the period there existed two supercontinents, Gondwana in the south and Laurasia in the north. South America, Africa (including the adjoining pieces of what are now the Arabian Peninsula and the Middle East), Antarctica, Australia, India, Madagascar, and several smaller landmasses were joined in Gondwana in the south, while North America, Greenland, and Eurasia (including Southeast Asia) formed Laurasia. Africa had split from South America, the last land connection being between Brazil and Nigeria. As a result, the South Atlantic Ocean joined with the widening North Atlantic. In the region of the Indian Ocean, Africa and Madagascar separated from India, Australia, and Antarctica in Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous times. Once separated from Australia and Antarctica, India began its journey northward, which culminated in a later collision with Asia during the Cenozoic Era. Madagascar broke away from Africa during the Late Cretaceous, and Greenland separated from North America. Australia was still joined to Antarctica. These were barely attached at the junction of what are now North and South America.
Sea level was higher during most of the Cretaceous than at any other time in Earth history, and it was a major factor influencing the paleogeography of the period. In general, world oceans were about 100 to 200 metres (330 to 660 feet) higher in the Early Cretaceous and roughly 200 to 250 metres (660 to 820 feet) higher in the Late Cretaceous than at present. The high Cretaceous sea level is thought to have been primarily the result of water in the ocean basins being displaced by the enlargement of midoceanic ridges.
As a result of higher sea levels during the Late Cretaceous, marine waters inundated the continents, creating relatively shallow epicontinental seas in North America, South America, Europe, Russia, Africa, and Australia. In addition, all continents shrank somewhat as their margins flooded. At its maximum, land covered only about 18 percent of Earth’s surface, compared with approximately 28 percent today. At times, Arctic waters were connected to the Tethys seaway through the middle of North America and the central portion of Russia. On several occasions during the Cretaceous, marine animals living in the South Atlantic had a seaway for migration to Tethys via what is presently Nigeria, Niger, Chad, and Libya. Most of western Europe, eastern Australia, parts of Africa, South America, India, Madagascar, Borneo, and other areas that are now land were entirely covered by marine waters for some interval of Cretaceous time.
Detailed study indicates 5 to 15 different episodes of rises and falls in sea level. The patterns of changes for the stable areas throughout history are quite similar, although several differences are notable. During most of the Early Cretaceous, parts of Arctic Canada, Russia, and western Australia were underwater, but most of the other areas were not. During the middle Cretaceous, east-central Australia experienced major inundations called transgressions. In the Late Cretaceous, most continental landmasses were transgressed but not always at the same time. One explanation for the lack of a synchronous record is the concept of geoidal eustacy, in which, it is suggested, as Earth’s continents move about, the oceans bulge at some places to compensate. Eustacy would result in sea level being different from ocean basin to ocean basin.
Water circulation and mixing were not as great as they are today, because most of the oceans (e.g., the developing North Atlantic) were constricted, and the temperature differences between the poles and the Equator were minimal. Thus, the oceans experienced frequent periods of anoxic (oxygenless) conditions in the bottom waters that reveal themselves today as black shales. Sometimes, particularly during the mid-Cretaceous, conditions extended to epicontinental seas, as attested by deposits of black shales in the western interior of North America.
The Cretaceous world had three distinct geographic subdivisions: the northern boreal, the southern boreal, and the Tethyan region. The Tethyan region separated the two boreal regions and is recognized by the presence of fossilized reef-forming rudist bivalves, corals, larger foraminiferans (single-celled organisms known for their glasslike shells, or tests), and certain ammonites (a group of extinct cephalopods known for their spiral shells) that inhabited only the warmer Tethyan waters. Early in the Cretaceous, North and South America separated sufficiently for the marine connection between the Tethys Sea and the Pacific to deepen substantially. The Tethys-to-Pacific marine connection allowed for a strong westward-flowing current, which is inferred from faunal patterns. For example, as the Cretaceous progressed, the similarity between rudist bivalves of the Caribbean and western Europe decreased, while some Caribbean forms have been found on Pacific seamounts, in Southeast Asia, and possibly in the Balkans.
The remnants of the northern boreal realm in North America, Europe, Russia, and Japan have been extensively studied. It is known, for instance, that sediments in the southwestern Netherlands indicate several changes of temperature during the Late Cretaceous. These temperature swings imply that the boundary between the northern boreal areas and the Tethys region was not constant with time. Russian workers recognize six paleobiogeographic zones: boreal, which in this context is equivalent to Arctic; European; Mediterranean, including the central Asian province; Pacific; and two paleofloristic zonations of land. Southern boreal areas and the rocks representing the southern Tethys margin lack this level of detail.
Magnetically, the Cretaceous was quiet relative to the subsequent Paleogene Period. In fact, magnetic reversals are not noted for a period of some 42 million years, from the early Aptian to the late Santonian ages. The lengths of Earth’s months (see synodic period) have changed regularly for at least the past 600 million years because of tidal friction and other forces that slow Earth’s rotation. The rate of change in the synodic month was minimal for most of the Cretaceous but has accelerated since. The reasons for these two anomalies are not well understood. .

Abstract
The continuous decline in Earth’s biodiversity represents a major crisis and challenge for the 21st century, and there is international political agreement to slow down or halt this decline. The challenge is in large part impeded by the lack of knowledge on the state and distribution of biodiversity – especially since the majority of species on Earth are un-described by science. All conservation efforts to save biodiversity essentially depend on the monitoring of species and populations to obtain reliable distribution patterns and population size estimates. Such monitoring has traditionally relied on physical identification of species by visual surveys and counting of individuals. However, traditional monitoring techniques remain problematic due to difficulties associated with correct identification of cryptic species or juvenile life stages, a continuous decline in taxonomic expertise, non-standardized sampling, and the invasive nature of some survey techniques. Hence, there is urgent need for alternative and efficient techniques for large-scale biodiversity monitoring. Environmental DNA (eDNA) – defined here as: genetic material obtained directly from environmental samples (soil, sediment, water, etc.) without any obvious signs of biological source material – is an efficient, non-invasive and easy-to-standardize sampling approach. Coupled with sensitive, cost-efficient and ever-advancing DNA sequencing technology, it may be an appropriate candidate for the challenge of biodiversity monitoring. Environmental DNA has been obtained from ancient as well as modern samples and encompasses single species detection to analyses of ecosystems. The research on eDNA initiated in microbiology, recognizing that culture-based methods grossly misrepresent the microbial diversity in nature. Subsequently, as a method to assess the diversity of macro-organismal communities, eDNA was first analyzed in sediments, revealing DNA from extinct and extant animals and plants, but has since been obtained from various terrestrial and aquatic environmental samples. Results from eDNA approaches have provided valuable insights to the study of ancient environments and proven useful for monitoring contemporary biodiversity in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. In the future, we expect the eDNA-based approaches to move from single-marker analyses of species or communities to meta-genomic surveys of entire ecosystems to predict spatial and temporal biodiversity patterns. Such advances have applications for a range of biological, geological and environmental sciences. Here we review the achievements gained through analyses of eDNA from macro-organisms in a conservation context, and discuss its potential advantages and limitations for biodiversity monitoring. .

1. Introduction
Pesticides constitute any substance or mixture of substances intended for preventing, destroying, repelling, or mitigating any pest. They can also serve as plant regulators, defoliants, or dessicants [1].
Chemicals have long been used to control pests. Sumerians already employed sulfur compounds to control insects and mites 4500 years ago. Pyrethrum, a compound derived from the dried flowers of
During World War II (1939-1945), the development of pesticides increased, because it was urgent to enhance food production and to find potential chemical warfare agents [3]. Consequently, the1940s witnessed a marked growth in synthetic pesticides like DDT, aldrin, dieldrin, endrin, parathion, and 2,4-D. In the 1950s, the application of pesticides in agriculture was considered advantageous, and no concern about the potential risks of these chemicals to the environment and the human health existed [2].
In 1962, Rachel Carson published the book “Silent Spring”, in which she mentioned problems that could arise from the indiscriminate use of pesticides. This book inspired widespread concern about the impact of pesticides on the human health and the environment. In 1967, Ratcliffe [4] noted increased incidence of raptor nests with broken eggs in the United Kingdom. This author showed that the sharp decline in eggshell thickness coincided with the beginning of the widespread use of DDT in agriculture (1945–1946). In the 1970s, pest resistance emerged which, combined with influence of the book “Silent Spring”, and accumulated evidence on the effects of pesticides, culminated in banning of the use of DDT in the United States in 1972. Thereafter, other countries discontinued the use of DDT, as well [5].
The 1970s and 1980s saw the introduction of more selective pesticides. In the 1990s, research activities concentrated on finding new members of existing pesticides that were even more selective. Besides, pesticides with new chemical groups emerged. During this period, safer chemicals arose. In addition, Integrated Pest Management (IPM) systems, came into play – these systems used crop production methods that attracted predators or parasites that attacked pests and timed pesticide applications to coincide with the most susceptible period of the pest’s life cycle, thereby reducing the amount of applied pesticides [2].
However, IPM or related methods did not eliminate the need for pesticides. These chemicals ensure the production of adequate quantities of high quality pest-free crops, which is important for food supply, prevents human diseases transmitted by insect or rodent vectors, and positively impacts public health [6].
The best pesticide policies need to reconcile environmental concerns with economic realities – pest management is mandatory, and farmers must survive economically. A number of studies have described the problems that not using pesticides would cause. Without pesticides, food production would be lower, and larger cultivated farm areas would be necessary to produce the same amount of food, which would impact the wildlife habitat. More frequent cultivation of the fields would be increase soil loss due to erosion, too. Knutson et al. [7] have pictured the U.S. society without pesticides: agricultural production would decrease, food prices would rise, farmers would be less competitive in global markets, and U.S. exports would drop, leading to many job losses [8].
Despite their benefits, pesticides can be hazardous to both humans and the environment. Countless chemicals are environmentally stable, prone to bioaccumulation, and toxic [6]. Because some pesticides can persist in the environment, they can remain there for years. Environmental contamination or occupational use can expose the general population to pesticides residues, including physical and biological degradation products present in the air, water, and food [9].
Less than 1% of the total amount of pesticides applied for weed and pest control reach the target pests. A large quantity of pesticides is lost via spray drift, off-target deposition, run-off, and photodegradation, for instance, which can have undesirable effects on some species, communities, or ecosystems as a whole, as well as on the humans [10]. Another relevant factor is that low concentrations of many chemicals may not elicit acute detectable effects in organisms, but they may induce other damage, like genetic disorders and physiological alterations, which reduce life span in the long run [11].
There are various ways to group pesticides, including classification based on the pests they control. Some example, insecticides combat insect growth or survival, herbicides act against plants, weeds, and grasses, rodenticides tight against rats and other rodents, avicides act against bird populations, fungicides attack fungi, and nematicides combat nematodes [12]. The global pesticide market divided according to the type of pesticide is as follows: 42.48% herbicides, 25.57% insecticides, 24.19% fungicides, and 7.76% other types of pesticides [13].
Pesticides grouping can also rely on their chemical structure. Organophosphorus (chlorpyrifos and diazinon), carbamates (carbaryl and aldicarb), organochlorine (DDT and aldrin), pyrethrins and pyrethroids (cyfluthrin and cypermethrin), benzoic acids (dicamba), triazines (atrazine and simazine), phenoxyacetic derivatives (2,4-D), dipyridyl derivatives (diquat and paraquat), glycine derivatives (glyphosate), and dithiocarbamates (maneb and ziram) [12].
Pesticides that bear similar chemical structures exhibit similar mechanism of toxicity and physicochemical properties, as well as comparable fate and transport properties. This chapter will deal with pesticides according to their chemical group. Pesticides belonging to different chemical classes but which have similar toxic effects, such as the ability to induce oxidative stress and act as endocrine disrupters will be treated as well.
2. Physical and chemical properties and stages of intoxication
2.1. Organophosphorus
Organic compounds containing phosphorus, the so called organophosphorus compounds (OP), have found application as pesticides and war gases since their synthesis, in 1937 [14]. OP contain carbon and derive from phosphorous acid. Their primary structure may vary depending on whether they bear sulfur (S) or oxygen (O) double binds. X is a group of the general structure that separates when the compound binds to acetylcholinesterase (AChE). On the basis of the variations in their general structure, it is possible to subdivide these compounds into phosphates, phosphorothioates, phosphoramidates, and phosphonate, for example. The structural difference between these compounds results in peculiar characteristics regarding OP metabolism and toxicity. Some representatives of this class of pesticides are Diazinon, Malathion, and Paration [15].
The skin, conjunctiva, gastrointestinal tract, and lungs rapidly absorb most OP compounds. Cytochrome P450 isozymes metabolize these chemicals in the liver, which sometimes generates metabolites that are more toxic than the parent compounds [16]. One example is the oxon form, which may bind to cholinesterase or undergo hydrolysis to a dialkyl phosphate and a hydrolyzed organic moiety specific to the pesticide [14]. Most OP are polar and hence water soluble. Their metabolites arise 12 to 48 h after exposure. However, a few compounds, such as dichlofenthion, possess high partition coefficients, which culminates in long-lasting symptoms [17].
These pesticides can reversibly or irreversibly stablish covalent bonds with the serine residue in the active site of acetyl cholinesterase, to prevent the natural function of this enzyme in the catabolism of neurotransmitters [14]. The formation of complexes between acetylcholinesterase enzymes and organophosphates leads to phosphorylation and deactivation, and the neurotransmitter acetylcholine consequently accumulates in the synaptic cleft. The accumulation of large amounts of acetylcholine stimulates and exhausts cholinergic synapses due to the excessive cholinergic activity produced by these agents [18]. The cholinesterase-bound phosphate group can lose the o,o-dialkyl groups or undergo hydrolysis, to regenerate the active enzyme. This process occurs not only in insects, but also in humans and the wildlife [14].
The main symptoms of pesticides intoxication can be differentiated into syndromes like the muscarinic syndrome, in which the action of acetylcholine on the smooth muscle, heart, and exocrine glands increases bronchial secretion, tearing, and sweating; disrupts the gastrointestinal tone to cause nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea; and elicits urinary incontinence, bronchospasm, miosis, and bradycardia. Another example is the nicotine syndrome, in which acetylcholine accumulates at the motor nerve endings in the autonomic ganglia and causes tremors, spasms, hypertonicity, hyperreflexia, paralysis, or muscle weakness and stimulates the sympathetic autonomic ganglia, to promote tachycardia, pallor, hyperglycemia, and hypertension. Additional effects on the central nervous system (CNS) include anxiety, headache, dizziness, ataxia, sleep and memory disorders seizures, tremors, respiratory depression, and coma. Some OP still have teratogenic potential and mutagenic effects. Laboratory diagnosis of this syndrome involves determination of cholinesterase activity [19].
To treat poisoning with OP, it is necessary to maintain vital functions and assess cholinesterase levels in the red cells and pseudocholinesterase levels in the plasma, before therapy. It is important to avoid the use of parasympathomimetic agents, which may increase the anticholinesterase activity. Treatment should start with atropine, which acts as a competitive muscarinic anticholinergic agent, together with pralidoxime, until complete control of the symptoms. After atropinization, administration of furosemide prevents pulmonary congestion, whereas administration of benzodiazepines controls seizures [20].
2.2. Carbamates
Carbamates insecticides produce clinical signs and symptoms of cholinergic excess that resemble the signs elicited by organophosphate toxicity, except that the effects are more reversible and less severe [14]. The mechanisms underlying carbamates poisoning involve carbamylation of the active site of acetylcholinesterase, which inactivate this essential enzyme in the nervous system of humans and other animal species [21]. The reaction of carbamates with acetylcholinesterase is similar to the reaction of OP with the same enzyme. However, reactivation of the carbamylated enzyme by hydrolysis is faster as compared with reactivation of the phosphorylated enzyme, with reversal of inhibition typically occurring half an hour or less after exposure [22]. Nevertheless, reports on cases of neuropathy after poisoning exist [23].
Organisms readily absorb carbamates through the lungs, gastrointestinal tract, and skin. Fortunately, carbamates poorly penetrate the blood-brain barrier. Therefore, they affect brain cholinesterases activity minimally and promote fewer CNS symptoms as compared with organophosphates. In addition, the spontaneous in vivo hydrolysis of the carbamate-cholinesterase complex contributes to less severe and less enduring symptoms.
The main symptoms of carbamates intoxication are miosis, salivation, sweating, tearing, rhinorrhea, behavioral change, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, urinary incontinence, bronchospasm, dyspnea, hypoxemia, bradycardia, bronchial secretions, pulmonary edema, respiratory failure, drop in body temperature, incoordination, lip tingling, tremors, and seizures. Less common symptoms include muscle spasms, twitching, muscle weakness (including respiratory muscles), paralysis, tachycardia, and hypertension [24].
The treatment of carbamates intoxication includes maintenance of vital functions. It is crucial to avoid the use of parasympathomimetic agents, because they may increase the anticholinesterase activity. Treatment should start with atropine, followed by administration of furosemide, only if necessary. If poisoning is due to pure carbamates only, it is not necessary to administrate pralidoxime, except in cases that these carbamates are associated with OPs [15].
2.3. Organochlorines
Organochlorine is used mainly as insecticides. Human body burden due to organochlorine pesticides results from the universal presence of these contaminants in the environment. This constitutes a major public health concern; indeed, organochlorines have been linked with cancer, asthma, diabetes, and growth disorders in children [25]. Organochlorine pesticides include cyclodienes, hexachlorocyclohexane isomers, and DDT and its analogues (e.g., DDE, methoxyclor, and dicofol) [14].
Exposure to organochlorines occurs via ingestion of contaminated food or water, inhalation of vapor, and absorption through the skin. Occupational and other domiciliary exposures are also possible. Dietary exposure results in bioaccumulation of these chemicals in the human body [26].
Organochlorines have similar structure – they all contain a cyclodiene ring. The lungs, gastrointestinal tract, and skin can absorb all these compounds. In addition, although the organism absorbs approximately 10% of the applied dose, lipid solvents increase dermal penetration [15], thereby raising the risk of intoxication in the case of workers who apply these products in crops without proper protective equipment.
The accumulation of organochlorine compounds is a result of their chemical structure and their physical properties such as polarity and solubility. These fat-soluble compounds persist in both the body and the environment. Consequently, researchers and regulatory agencies have banned several organochlorines [14].
The main symptoms of organichlorines intoxication are dizziness, headache, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, malaise, dermatitis, diarrhea, apprehension, excitement, irritability, gait disorders, excessive sweating, altered reflexes, muscle weakness, tremors, spasms, mental confusion, anxiety, seizures, coma, and death. The carcinogenicity of this class of compound is assigned to polychlorocyclodiene compounds that form epoxides during their biotransformation. Because organochlorines have long half-life, these levels in the serum constitute a marker of exposure to these pesticides [15].
To treat organochlorines intoxication, it is necessary to maintain the vital functions, administer diazepam and phenobarbital by slow injection, to control seizures, and to monitor the airways closely. Lorazepam constitutes an alternative to diazepam. Ion exchange resins can also be administered orally. Arrhythmias that damage the myocardium rarely occur. Lidocaine is the treatment of choice [27].
2.4. Pyrethrins and pyrethroids
Pyrethrins and pyrethroids function mainly as iseticides. Pyrethrins are natural compounds originating from the plant
Crude pyrethrum is a dermal and respiratory allergen, probably due it is to non-insecticidal ingredients. Contact dermatitis and allergic respiratory reactions (rhinitis and asthma) have occurred after exposure to this compound [28].
Both pyrethrins and pyrethroids bear an acid moiety, a central ester bond, and an alcohol moiety in their structure. This class of compounds typically exists as stereoisomers (
After absorption, rapid pyrethroids distribution occurs in the organism. Therein, these compounds undergo biotransformation via two mechanisms: hydrolysis of the ester linkage by carboxylesterases and oxidation of the alcohol moiety by cytochromes P450 [30]. Pyrethroids exert the same mechanism of action in insects and mammals. Both pyrethrins and pyrethroids have insecticide potential because they can disrupt the muscular system and alter the normal functioning of voltage-dependent sodium channels. Sodium channels play an important role in the cell-to-cell communication, which is vital for the function of more excitable cells involved in the action potential that the excitable cells can propagate in the CNS. Pyrethroids bind to the α-subunit of the sodium channel that is left open for a longer time, to increase membrane permeability to sodium. Consequently, these compounds cause paralysis, especially in flying insects, known as knockdown. The specific interaction of pyrethroids with the sodium channel shows both the activation and inactivation properties of the sodium channel, making the hyperexcited cells [31]. After interaction of moderate levels of pyrethroids with the sodium channel, the cell can continue to operate in an abnormal state of hyperexcitability. The amplitude of the sodium current remains unchanged until the level of hyperexcitability overwhelms the maintenance of the activity of the sodium channel. This culminates in depolarization and blocks conduction of the action potential until the situation in the cell becomes unsustainable [31].
The toxicodynamics of pyrethroids may also include other mechanisms such as antagonism of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), stimulation of chloride channels modulated by protein kinase, modulation of nicotinic cholinergic transmission, increased release of noradrenaline, and deregulation of calcium homeostasis. Authors have also proposed that pyrethroids act on the voltage-sensitive chloride channels as well as on the voltage-dependent calcium channels [31].
Diagnosis can be difficult because acute pyrethroid poisoning can be mistaken for OP intoxication. Pyrethroid poisoning symptoms are: tremors, spasms, incoordination, prostration, drooling, irregular movements of the limbs, tonic and clonic convulsions, and hypersensitivity to stimuli. It can also cause skin irritation and tingling due to hyperactivity of cutaneous sensory nerve fibers. Eye miosis also occurs due to exposure [32].
Because exposure to pyrethroids does not usually prompt systemic effects, most patients only require decontamination of the skin and eyes, besides basic maintenance of the vital functions. Paresthesia usually subsides within 12-24 h, which dismisses direct treatment. If severe skin irritation occurs, application of DL-α-tocopherol acetate (Vitamin E) should alternate this problem. Gastric lavage is discarded in case of ingestion, because solvents present in many formulations may increase the risk of aspiration pneumonia. Ingestion of a potentially toxic amount requires administration of activated charcoal within one hour of the event [32].
2.5. Triazines
Triazines are effective and inexpensive compounds that have found application as herbicides. They combat a wide spectrum of weeds by inhibiting photosynthesis and the electron transport chain in plants. Physiological and molecular changes due to accumulation of these compounds in organisms remain unclear. Human exposure to triazines has been associated with carcinogenicity and endocrine disruption, but these effects are still debatable [33]. The chemical structures of triazine herbicides correspond to permutations of the alkyl substituted 2,4-diamines of chlorotriazine [14].
After absorption, these compounds undergo conjugation with glutathione or simply dealkylation. The chlorine group of the triazine structure is replaced with the free-SH group of glutathione, the terminal peptide is cleaved, and the cysteine moiety is N-acetylated. The mercapturate residues and the dealkylation metabolites are subsequently excreted in the urine [14]. Triazines have low acute oral and dermal toxicity. Chronic toxicity studies have primarily indicated reduced body weight gain [16].
Atrazine is the often most studied triazine herbicide. Authors have investigated their carcinogenic potential in mice and rats. Tumor incidence did not augment in mice, whereas atrazine appeared to increase the incidence of mammary carcinoma in Sprague-Dawley rats [34, 35].
Reports of human poisoning by this class of compounds are rare. When they happen, irritation at the site of contamination such as the skin, eyes, nose, and TGI occurs. Triazines may be carcinogenic and teratogenic, but there is still no evidence that this is really the case. Contamination with atrazine may also cause sensory motor polyneuropathy [15, 33].
Because exposure to triazines usually causes local irritation, in most cases it is only necessary to decontaminate the site exposed to the substance, besides offering basic life support [15].
2.6. Phenoxy derivatives
The structures of phenoxy derivatives bear an aliphatic carboxylic acid moiety attached to a chloride or methyl-substituted aromatic ring. The commonest phenoxy herbicides are 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) and 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T). A combination of these two herbicides in equal proportions affords Agent Orange, a product applied in the jungles of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia during the Vietnam War. Manufacture of phenoxy herbicides often requires co-formulation with ioxynil and/or bromoxynil, which are generally more toxic than the herbicides. Moreover, other more toxic substances can emerge during the fabrication of some of these herbicides at excessively high temperatures, such as at chlorinated dibenzo dioxin and chlorinated dibenzo furan [36]. Because 2,4,5-T contains the highly toxic and persistent 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzeno-
Phenoxy salts and esters rapidly dissociate or hydrolyze in vivo, so the toxicity of the derivative will depend mainly on the acid form of the pesticide. Individuals and species vary substantially in terms of phenoxy herbicides elimination. The biological half-life of herbicides in humans reportedly varies from 12 to 72 h [36], but long half-lives occur at large doses and after prolonged exposure [28].
The gastrointestinal tract absorbs phenoxy derivatives. The lungs absorb them less, their cutaneous absorption is minimal, and fat does not store them. Phenoxy derivatives exhibit a variety of mechanisms of toxicity including dose-dependent cell membrane damage, uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation, and disruption of acetylcoenzyme A metabolism [36]. Phenoxy acids and esters are moderately irritating to the skin, eyes, and the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and mucous membranes. Their toxicity on the CNS is dose-dependent. These derivatives disrupt the blood-brain barrier and the neuronal membrane transport mechanisms, and damage to the intracellular membrane results in uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation [36]. In addition, prolonged inhalation of these herbicides may cause burning sensation in the nasopharynx and dizziness. Some recent studies have examined female exposure to herbicides and assessed effects such as spontaneous abortion, birth defects, and infertility, among others [28].
Intoxication by this class of compounds is uncommon, but when they occur they can cause serious sequelae. The main symptoms are nausea, dizziness, vomiting, burning in the mouth, constipation, abdominal pain, numbness, diarrhea, gastrointestinal bleeding, gastrointestinal fluid loss, vasodilation and/or direct toxicity due to grafting hypotension, ECG alterations like ventricular or supraventricular tachycardia and, on rare occasions, sinus bradycardia. In more severe cases, agitation, confusion, weakness, paralysis, coma, and death by ventricular fibrillation can occur, and chances of survival are small. Other disrupted functions comprise changes in the NCS [36]. Some compounds of this class (e.g., 2,4,5-T) can also produce carcinogenic and teratogenic effects as well as hepatotoxicity. As for metabolic acidosis, clinical signs such as hyperthermia (due to uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation), renal failure, increased aspartate aminotransferase and alanine and lactate dehydrogenase, thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia, and hypocalcemia activities can arise [36].
In general, treatment of phenoxy derivatives poisoning includes maintenance of the vital functions. If the poisoning is due to ingestion, administration of activated charcoal is necessary for adsorption of the compounds, provided that intoxication occurred within an hour. Systemic poisoning calls for hemodialysis, but other effective purification methods exist, like alkalinization of the urine flow and increase of urine volume to facilitate excretion. To control seizures, administration of benzodiazepines is mandatory [36].
2.7. Dipyridyl derivatives
The dipyridyl compounds paraquat and diquat are non-selective contact herbicides that have found wide application in agriculture and industries. They help to control weeds. However, these compounds are highly toxic and managing poisoning with these substances requires a great skill and knowledge of proper management procedures [28].
Paraquat (1,1’-dimethyl-4,4’-dipyridylium) is a dipyridylium quaternary ammonium compound related to diquat and morfamquat. The latter product is the least toxic but also the least effective herbicide [15]. Their biotransformation produces free radicals, with consequent lipid peroxidation and cell injury [37].
Paraquat causes aggressive tissue damage in the lungs, kidney, and liver. The major target organ of paraquat poisoning is the lung, which consists of the most lethal and the least treatable manifestation of toxicity. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a crucial role in paraquat induced pulmonary injury, characterized by edema hemorrhage and hypoxemia, as well as infiltration of inflammatory cells [28, 38].
The other representative of this class is diquat (1,1’-ethylene-2,2’-bipyridilium), which causes fewer poisoning events than paraquat, the reason why reports on human toxicity and animal experimental data are less extensive for diquat than paraquat. The mechanisms of paraquat and diquat toxicity are similar: radicals destroy lipid membranes. After absorption, diquat does not selectively concentrate in the lung tissue, but it exerts severe toxic effects on the CNS, an event that is not typical in the case of paraquat [28]. The kidney is the main excretory pathway for absorbed diquat. Renal damage is therefore an important feature of diquat poisoning [15, 28].
A very interesting action against poisoning by diquat and paraquat is the addition of an emetic agent in their formulations, wherein the additive acts rapidly in the body and causes the individual to regurgitate the pesticide before it performs its toxic action [38 - 40]. The main poisoning symptoms are dehydration resulting from vomiting. The high oxidative stress elicited by these herbicides causes necrosis in the gastrointestinal tract, kidney tubules, liver, and lung; in the latter case, respiratory failure and pulmonary fibrosis may occur. Ingestion of large amounts of these compounds leads to death within two to three weeks, a result of acute renal failure, hepatitis, and especially respiratory failure caused by pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis. In addition to the systemic effects, these compounds are very harmful to the skin and may cause severe burns [38, 41].
The treatment of poisoning with dipyridyl derivatives includes maintenance of the vital functions, minimization of the absorption of the compound more cathartic (activated charcoal), acceleration of excretion (forced diuresis, hemodialysis, or hemoperfusion), abatement of the effects on the affected tissue, and fluid replacement. Topical lesions should be treated with topical silver sulfadiazine, combined with systemic antibiotics [41]. An addition method to recognize paraquat poisoning is to test the urine with sodium dithionite [42].
2.8. Glycine derivatives
Two representatives of this class are glyphosate (N-phosphonomethyl glycine) and glufosinate (N-phosphonomethyl homoalanine), marketed primarily as the isopropylamine salt (glyphosate) or ammonium salt (glufosinate). Both substances are broad-spectrum nonselective systemic herbicides with application in for post-emergent control of annual and perennial plants. Although both compounds contain a P=O moiety, they are not organophosphates, but organophosphonates, and they do not inhibit AChE [36].
Glyphosate, which contains phosphorus, is a herbicide used in 75% of all the genetically modified crops (GMCs), which tolerate high concentrations of this compound [36, 43]. Glyphosate inhibits an enzyme in the biosynthesis of tryptophan, phenylalanine, and tyrosine, present in plants, fungi, and bacteria, but not in animals or humans. [44]. However, according to literature reports, glyphosate can enter living organisms, including humans, where it exerts various toxic effects [45].
One pathway of glyphosate metabolism involves formation of aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA) by action of glyphosate oxidoreductase; AMPA is also the metabolite that emerges in humans [36]. Knowledge of the toxicokinetics of glyphosate derives mainly from animal studies and the similar patterns of absorption, metabolism, and eliminations in humans [46]. Rats absorb only 30% glyphosate after oral administration [36]. Glyphosate plasma concentrations peak at 1-2 h, and declined thereafter, with distributions to the intestine, colon, kidney, and bones [47].
The mechanisms of toxicity of glyphosate formulations are complicated [36]. The most widely used glyphosate product is Roundup®, formulated as a concentrate containing 41% glyphosate [16]. Some in vitro studies have suggested that, at high concentrations of glyphosate, its metabolites and impurities may reduce acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity [48], although no evidence for significant AChE inhibition in mammals in vivo exists [36]. A study published in the
Glufosinate inhibits the synthesis of glutamine in plants, and plant death occurs as a consequence of the increased ammonia levels [16]. Glufosinate supress the activity of glutamine synthetase and glutamate decarboxylase, reducing glutamic acid levels and elicits various types of moderate-to-severe CNS toxicities [51]. Given the differences in the biochemical and metabolic pathways of plants and mammals, glufosinate ammonium formulations are minimally toxic to humans [52]. However, ingestion of the undiluted form can cause grave outcomes such as seizures, respiratory arrest, coma, and disturbance of consciousness, which appear after a latent period of 4 – 60 h [53]. No work has reported that this compound induces genotoxic or carcinogenic effects or that impacts reproduction and fertilization [16].
The effects of this class of compounds range from irritation upon local contact (skin, GI), to hypotension, development of acute renal failure with oliguria, and severe hypoxia and death [54].
The treatment of glycine derivatives poisoning includes maintenance of the vital functions. Hemodialysis is crucial to reduce the amount of toxins normally excreted by the kidney, thereby preventing the impacts on this organ [54].
2.9. Dithiocarbamates
Dithiocarbamates comprise two groups: [1] dimethyldithiocarbamate and [2] ethylenebisdithiocarbamate, depending on which metal cation is present in the chemical structure. The nomenclature of various compounds of this class is related to the association of the metal cations; e. g., maneb (manganese), and zineb and ziram (zinc) [16, 50].
The slow absorption of these compounds means that they have low acute oral and dermal toxicity. On the other hand, chronic exposure to dithiocarbamates leads to adverse effects due to contact with dithiocarbamate acid or metal ligand [16].
The metabolite that arises from dithiocarbamates biotransformation is ethylenethiourea (ETU), which induces thyroid cancer and modifies thyroid hormones. Moreover, dithiocarbamates and disulfiram have similar structures, and both can inhibit acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, the enzyme that converts acetaldehyde into acetic acid [55].
Although these products are little toxicity to humans, they are potential precursors of ethylenethiourea, which has carcinogenic and teratogenic action.
There is no specific treatment for poisoning with this class of compounds, so only maintenance of vital functions and minimization of their absorption (activated charcoal) are necessary.
2.10. Others
Others classes of pesticides exist, including the chloroacetanilide commonly used in agriculture. A number of chloroacetanilides, like alachlor, acetochlor, metolachlor, and propachlor are carcinogenic [56]. The metabolism of chloroacetanilides most likely proceeds via conjugation with glutathione, as judged from the amount of glutathione-related metabolites in the urine of rats treated with these herbicides. [57]. However, the predicted differences between humans and rats in terms of disposition together with the lower rates of alachlor metabolism in human nasal microsomes have led scientists to question the human relevance of chloroacetanilide olfactory carcinogenicity [58].
Benzimidazoles are another important class of pesticides. They are commonly used as veterinary medicines (anthelmintics) and pesticides. They inhibit microtubule formation when they bind to free β-tubulin monomers at the colchicine-binding site [59].
Regarding new technologies, nanopesticides or nanoplant protection products represent an emerging technological development. In relation to pesticide use, these technologies could offer a range of benefits including increased efficacy and durability, and they use of smaller amounts of active ingredients [60]. Nanopesticides “involve either very small particles of a pesticide active ingredient (ai) or other small engineered structures with useful pesticidal properties” [61]. Nanoformulations combine several surfactants, polymers (organic), and metal nanoparticles (inorganic) in the nanometer size range [62].

Recently, some studies have reported on the nanomaterial-induced perturbation of different cell death pathways. In the majority of the cases, the key to understanding the toxicity of nanomaterials is that their smaller size as compared with cells and cellular organelles allows them to penetrate these basic biological structures and disrupt their normal function [63]. Thus, advances in research into the mechanism of action of nanopesticides will allow better prediction of the consequences of human exposure to these materials.
All these compounds are among more than 1000 active ingredients that are marketed as insecticide, herbicide, and fungicide. However, with the news pest resistance and need to hygienic controls the quantities of the formulations have been increased constantly [64].
Ass seen above, pesticides currently used over the world are numerous and have various chemical and physico-chemical properties [21]. Nevertheless, is already known that long-term contact to pesticides can harm human life and can disturb the function of different organs in the body, including nervous, endocrine, immune, reproductive, renal, cardiovascular, respiratory systems, and chronic diseases, including cancer, Parkinson, Alzheimer, multiple sclerosis, diabetes [64].
3. Pesticides and oxidative stress
Interest in the toxicological aspects of oxidative stress has grown in recent years. Many researchers have focused on the mechanistic aspect of oxidative damage and cellular responses in biological systems, mainly in the case of pesticides, because oxidative stress is a condition that stems from exposure to various classes of these compounds.
Oxidative stress occurs when the rate of reactive species production exceeds the rate of reactive species decomposition in antioxidant systems, which culminates in increased oxidative damage in different cellular targets [72]. Reactive species comprise substances that do not necessarily have unpaired electrons but are very reactive due to their instability [73]. Free radicals are atoms, molecules, or ions with unpaired electrons on an otherwise open shell configuration are examples of reactive species. Their electrons are usually highly reactive [74].
Oxygen and nitrogen free radicals play an essential role in the physiological control of cell function in biological systems. Living cells continuously produce these radicals [73]. In aerobic organisms, several basic cellular metabolic processes induce production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) within cells. Cellular respiration involves reduction of molecular oxygen (O2) to water during oxidative phosphorylation in the electron transport chain, to generate reactive, partially reduced intermediates such as the superoxide anion radical (.O2-), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and the hydroxyl radical (HO.) [75]. Around 5% of these ROS originate from electron transport chain processes and can damage cellular components [76]. Moreover, several enzymes produce ROS, thereby constituting a second source of ROS synthesis in cells [77].
Regulated ROS production is higher in organisms, and maintenance of redox homeostasis is essential for the physiological health [78]. Living organisms have developed adequate enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidant mechanisms to protect cellular components from oxidative damage [79].
Exposure to some xenobiotics, especially toxic chemical pollutants, such as pesticides, may produce an imbalance between endogenous antioxidants and ROS, with subsequent decrease in antioxidant defenses to trigger oxidative stress in biological systems, damage to tissues, inflammation, degenerative diseases, and aging [79]. As mentioned previously, many classes of pesticides induce oxidative stress, through several different mechanisms. They may affect the redox cycle by donating electrons to or withdrawing electrons from cell components. During metabolism, they may deplete glutathione (endogenous antioxidant) or even inactivate other endogenous antioxidants [74]. In short, oxidative stress can take place either through overproduction of free radicals or alteration in antioxidant mechanisms [80]. Increased concentration of plasma and red blood cell thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARs), changes in the antioxidant status, and altered activities of cellular enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) indicated higher oxidative stress in pesticides sprayers. Hence, many researchers have associated exposure to pesticides with oxidative stress [81].
Several works have described oxidative stress induction after exposure to organophosphorus insecticides. The stress is a result of intracellular Ca+2 influx, which leads to cholinergic hyperactivity and activates proteolytic enzymes and nitric oxide synthase, which in turn generates free radicals [74]. Fenitrothion, a phosphorothioate, has been linked to histopathological effects on the liver and kidneys and cytotoxic effects on the lungs. These effects originate from ROS generation via pesticide metabolism by P450 or via high-energy consumption coupled with inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation [82]. Moreover, hydrocarbon insecticides chlorinated like DDT can induce oxidative stress after metabolic activation by CYP450 [80].
Synthetic pyrethroids are less persistent and less toxic to mammals and birds. Deltamethrin is one of the pyrethroids that has found wide acceptability. Nevertheless, this pyrethroid has effects on the nervous, respiratory, and hematological systems in fish, and it displays tumorigenicity in rodents [80]. All these effects are due to oxidative stress; they impact various antioxidants [83].
A classic example of oxidative stress induction among pesticides is the action of dipyridyls such as paraquat. This compound enters the redox cycle and constantly generates ROS such as the superoxide anion and the hydroxyl and peroxyl radicals [74]. ROS play a crucial role in the development of paraquat-induced pulmonary injury [38]. The basic mechanism of oxidative stress in this class is simple: the dipyridyl initiates a cyclic oxidation/reduction process. First, they undergo one-electron reduction by NADPH to form free radicals. The latter donate their electron to O2, to give a superoxide radical. Upon NADPH exhaustion, to superoxides react to produce hydroxyl free radicals and other reactive species that lead to oxidative stress and consequent cell death [80]. The free radicals react with lipids in cell membranes, to start a destructive process known as lipid peroxidation. The lung is the organ that is mostly involved in this case [38]. Other compounds, like dithiocarbamates mainly inhibit antioxidant enzymes, such as SOD and catalase [84].
Pesticides can induce free radical formation by altering the way that cell organelles, like mitochondria operate. Rotenone, an insecticide of the class of rotenoids, strengthens the case for complex I inhibition – rotenone specifically binds to complex I, to inhibit the electron flow through the respiratory chain. Deficiencies in the mitochondrial respiratory chain diminish ATP synthesis and produce ROS, which culminates in oxidative stress, mitochondrial depolarization, and initiation of cell death processes [16, 75].
In this context, many studies in human or animals have evidenced that pesticides exert their toxic action in the body via oxidative stress induction both upon acute and chronic exposure.
4. Pesticides and endocrine disruption
The endocrine system refers to glands located in several areas of the body. Glands release some hormones that enter the circulation and act on specific “target” organs. If an event disrupts the endocrine system, some organs will not receive the correct amount of hormones and might not function properly or even function wrongly. In this context, low levels of some pesticides in the environment can impair the endocrine system [85].
Besides their primary action as pesticides, organophosphorus, carbamates, and organochlorines can act as endocrine disruptors and affect the function of hormones by blocking, mimicking, displacing, or acting to subvert their natural roles in living species. DDT and its metabolites are among the most famous endocrine disruptors. DDT was widely used in the 1950s and 1960s, and it is still allowed in some countries. Its proven estrogenic action can affect the reproductive system of mammals and birds [86].
In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that pyretroids also act as endocrine disruptors, but their effects only arise at relatively high levels [87]. Atrazine, a triazine herbicide, may also exert endocrine-disrupting effects on amphibians [5].
5. Pesticides and human health
Many workers and residents, especially in the rural sector, are in contact with pesticides on a daily basis, so they are at high risk of poisoning by these compounds. This exposure can cause neuropsychiatric sequelae (mood disorders, depression, and anxiety), because many pesticides underlie changes in the function (e.g., cholinergic crisis) of the central, peripheral, and autonomic nervous system, which are often followed by suicide attempts. In addition to being causative agents of neuropsychiatric disorders that might culminate in suicide, these effects may lead to the use of pesticides as a weapon [88].
According to data released by the World Health Organization (WHO) [89], suicide by pesticides is common in many Asian and Latin American countries. Pesticides are often poorly controlled and widely available, particularly in countries of low and middle income [42]. The first epidemiological reports of suicides involving pesticides appeared in the beginning of the 1990s. Currently, homicides and suicides involving pesticides have raised the concern of many organizations and governments as, depression and suicide clearly correlate with high exposure to pesticides. This concern has motivated and still motivates many studies into how and why exposure to pesticide occurs; researchers have also caught methods to solve this serious social problem [88].
Detoxification measures after poisoning are crucial, no matter whether exposure was intentional, accidental, or occupational. Recognition of poisoning is easy when the patient knows which pesticide he/she was exposed to or when symptoms are typical. However, poisoning may be unclear if the patient has generalized symptoms. Therefore, along with the procedures to terminate contamination, an investigation with family members and the people present at the time of contamination, and information on patient care should exist. These individual will be questioned, about the way in which the patient was exposed to the contaminant and about the possibility of simultaneous intoxication with other poisons [27]. Along with these recognition steps the analytical detection of pesticides is mandatory.
Decontamination methods must be combined with care and maintenance of vital signs and administration of antidotes. It is important to bear in mind that new cases of contamination may appear. Furthermore, professionals as well as other patients staying in the same ward as the contaminated individuals must wear protective equipment until decontamination and treatment are complete [27].
Methods exist to decontaminate patients poisoned via gastrointestinal tract. Gastric lavage is extremely invasive and aggressive to the body, so it is indicated only in potentially fatal cases. The cathartic method, which elicits bowel movement to force excretion of the pesticide, is not suitable when poisoning induces diarrhea. Administration of adsorbents is an alternative – adsorbents can bind to the toxic agent, to form a stable compound. This compound is not absorbed by the gastrointestinal tract and is subsequently excreted with the feces. This method is commonly performed in conjunction with the cathartic method. The most usual adsorbent is activated charcoal, but it does not adsorb all pesticides. Finally, the syrup ipeac, a medicinal plant, can help to induce vomit. However, this procedure is contraindicated in the case of ingestion of hydrocarbons or corrosive substances [27, 28].
In the case of dermal exposure, it is necessary to start the decontamination process by placing the patient under a shower and using soap and water to remove the chemicals from the skin, hair, nails, ear canals, and other possibly contaminated body parts. If contact occurs by the ocular route, it is essential to rinse the eyes with plenty of clean water. All the materials and clothes used by the patient at the time of intoxication, like clothes and shoes, should be removed. In cases of large contamination, it is crucial to consider the need to decontaminate all the people who work in the emergency system [27, 28].
Because hundreds of pesticides compositions exist, we will focus on the clinical profile and treatment of pesticides that cause major poisoning, in terms of quantity and severity of cases. In general, treatment aims to override the mechanism of action of the toxic pesticides, and many possibilities exist (Table 2).
|Pharmacological antagonism - competes with pesticides for the target site|
|Physiological antagonism - reversal of a physiological effect of the pesticide|
|Changing distribution to tissues – e.g., competition with membrane pumps|
|Modification of biochemical pathways - interferes with the biochemical response of the pesticide|
|Chelation of a pesticide to disable it|
|Treatment of pathological response to tissue injury caused by pesticides|
An example of suicide attempt has been the case of a man aged 22 who tried to kill himself by drinking a solution of paraquat (50 mL). He underwent gastric lavage and received activated charcoal. Later, he was discharged. However, the treatment did not suffice – four days later, the man returned to the hospital with sore throat, dysphagia, retrosternal pain, hemoptysis, and blistering and ulceration of the mouth and tongue. Biochemical tests revealed elevated creatinine levels, leukocytosis, hyponatremia, and metabolic acidosis. Because the effect had become systemic, the patient had to undergo hemodialysis and immunosuppressive therapy (cyclophosphamide, methylprednisolone, and dexamethasone). The patient did not improve and presented hemoptysis. Examination of the thoracic region detected localized alveolar infiltrate, pulmonary opacities, pneumomediastinum, pneumothorax, and subcutaneous emphysema. The patient's condition worsened, and he -underwent the same immunosuppressive therapy again. The patient recovered gradually; he was discharged after four weeks. After four months, he was working again. His lungs did not return to perfect condition – the man still this place crackles in the lower lung fields, universally distributed wheezing and pleural friction in the right hemithorax, and dyspnea after physical exertion [40].
An example of homicide involving pesticides is the case of a 52-year-old entrepreneur that was killed by injections of poison in his abdomen, conducted by their business rivals. Soon after he was attacked, the man was taken to a private clinic to receive primary treatment, and later he was taken to a hospital, where hours later he was pronounced dead. The body was sent to the morgue for post-mortem examination. Necropsy revealed distended abdomen and two punctures by needles in this region; necrotic changes appeared in the tissue around these two holes. Analysis of the organs revealed congested and edematous brain and lungs, as well as congested stomach with hemorrhagic spots. The toxicological analysis report described the presence of organochlorine pesticides in the region of the piercings and all viscera. This suggested that the man died due to cerebral and pulmonary edema after organochlorine poisoning [90].
Apart from intentional exposure to pesticides, cases of accidental poisoning occur frequently. A Latin American man (66 years old), who had a history of diabetes mellitus (type 2), hypertension, and alcohol abuse, was admitted to the emergency department unconscious, reaching a score of 5 in the Glasgow Coma Scale; he also presented hypotension (blood pressure 87/45 mmHg), sweating, and hypoxia. On the basis of reports by his wife, she had accidentally mixed Roundap in his alcohol, and he had ingested between 350 and 500 mL of rum Roundup. About two hours after ingestion, she found him with altered mental status, non-bilious vomiting, and difficulty to wake, but he did not present bleeding. Biochemical analysis revealed high hypoxia and lactic acidosis as well as AG and high osmolar gap. First care included intubation, ventilation, and fluid bolus with 2 L of normal saline and 1 L of sodium bicarbonate. His condition worsened, and he rapidly went into shock (blood pressure 66/43 mmHg), with acute renal failure, hyperkalemia, leukocytosis, and worsening lactic acidosis. On the basis of these results, health professionals administered high dose of Levophed (Hospira, Lake Forest, Illinois) and vasopressin to provide pressure support and continuous veno-venous hemofiltration. After 24 h, the patient’s conditions improved. Treatment was discontinued, and renal and cerebral functions were fully recovered [91].
Finally, cases of poisoning due to occupational exposure exist. Some pesticides can cause topical damage when they come in contact with the skin, as in the case of two farm workers admitted to the hospital in great pain due to extensive chemical burns in the perineal and scrotal regions, caused by Ducatalon (a dipyridyl herbicide containing a mixture of diquat and paraquat). The men suffered burns due to a leak in the equipment they used to spray the herbicide. Lesions reduced upon topical treatment with silver sulfadiazine associated with systemic administration of antibiotics. Fortunately, in a few days, the damaged skin recovered without scars. After replacement of the faulty equipment, no more injuries occurred [41].
6. Pesticides and environmental health
Pesticides reach the environment primarily during preparation and application. Application can take place via different techniques, depending on factors such as the formulation type, the controlled pest and, the application timing. In agriculture, it is possible to apply pesticides to the crop or to the soil. Liquids sprays are commonly used in crops; for example, boom sprayers, tunnel sprayers, or aerial application. Systemic pesticides can also be employed. As for soils, pesticides can be applied as granules, injected as a fumigant, or sprayed onto the soil surface, which is possibly followed by pesticide incorporation into the soil top layer. Seeds are sometimes treated with pesticides prior to planting. [92].
After application, pesticides can be taken up by target organisms, degraded, or transported to the groundwater; they can also enter the surface water bodies, volatilize to atmosphere, or reach non-target organisms by ingestion, for example. The physical and chemical properties of the pesticide, soil, site conditions, and management practices influence the behavior and fate of pesticides [93].
Concerning the physical and chemical properties of pesticides, their solubility determines their transport in surface runoff and their leaching to groundwater. The higher the solubility, the greater the carrying and leaching. The partition coefficient also affects the behavior of pesticides, and many chemicals do not leach because soil particles adsorb them.
Adsorption depends on the chemical and also on the soil type. The volatility of pesticides indicates their tendency to become a gas; the higher the volatility (high vapor pressure), the larger their loss to the atmosphere. Environmental conditions such as temperature and humidity impact volatility, which can occur from soil, plants, or surface water, and may continue for several days or weeks after pesticide application. In the atmosphere, the chemicals can be transported over long distances. Subsequent atmospheric deposition can contribute to surface water pollution. Finally, the degradation of pesticides that also determines the behavior and fate of these compounds in the environment. Degradation (their brake down into other chemical forms) can occur by photodecomposition, microorganisms, and a variety of chemical and physical reactions. Pesticides with low biodegradation are called persistent, they can remain in the environment for a long time [94, 95].
Soil properties can also affect the movement of pesticides. In relation to the soil texture, coarse-textured sands and gravels have high infiltration capacities, and water tends to percolate through the soil and reach groundwater. Fine-textured soils such as clays generally have low infiltration capacities, so water tends to run off, reaching streams and lakes. Moreover, soil containing more clay in its composition bears larger surface area to adsorb pesticides. Regarding permeability, highly permeable soils allow water to more easily. This water may contain dissolved pesticides, which will reach groundwater. Texture influences soil permeability. Ultimately, soils with high organic matter content can adsorb pesticides and retain water with dissolved chemicals. Moreover, these soils possess a larger population of microorganisms that can degrade the pesticides [93, 94].
The site conditions that can determine pesticide behavior in the environment are depth until the groundwater, geological conditions, topography, and climate. In the case of shallow groundwater, the soil filters smaller amount of water with chemicals and adsorbs and degrades lower quantities of pesticides, so contamination is a major concern. Regarding the geological conditions, the presence of wells, sinkholes, and highly permeable materials, such as gravel deposits, facilitates groundwater contamination. On the other hand, the existence of drainage ditches, streams, ponds, and lakes increases the probability that rainfall or irrigation runoff will contaminate surface water. In relation to topography, flat landscapes, areas with closed drainage systems where water drains toward the center of a basin, and especially sinkhole areas, are more susceptible to groundwater contamination. As for climate, large rainfall or irrigation may culminate in large amounts of water percolating through the soil, to reach groundwater. Rainfall can also carry pesticides to surface waters, contaminating rivers, lakes, and seas, and taking these chemicals to distant places [94].
Finally, management practices can affect the movement of pesticides. With respect to the application methods, pesticides injected or incorporated into the soil are more available for leaching and reaching groundwater, whereas pesticides sprayed onto crops are more susceptible to volatilization and surface runoff, reaching surface waters and the atmosphere. Concerning the application rates and timing, the use of larger amounts of a pesticide during are rainfall or irrigation facilitates the assess of the chemical to groundwater. With respect to handling practices, correct storage and disposal of the pesticides containers impact environmental contamination [94].
The fact that a contaminant is present in the environment does not necessarily mean that it will reach an organism. The contaminant and the organism must overlap in time and space for exposure to occur. Contact can be dermal or oral or even via inhalation, gills, and, more rarely, injection [5].
Once pesticides reach non-target organisms, they may undergo biotransformation via reactions like hydrolysis, oxidation, reduction, or conjugation catalyzed by liver enzymes. Biotransformation is an effort of the organism to detoxify and eliminate xenobiotics, but this process can also produce metabolites that are more toxic than their parent compound, a phenomenon called bioactivation. An example of bioactivation is the biotransformation of DDT, which is not highly toxic to birds, into DDE, which causes thinning of eggshells because it disrupts calcium metabolism [5].
In organisms, the absorption of a pesticide with high lipid solubility and low elimination rate can lead to bioaccumulation of this chemical in the fatty tissue, and the final concentration of the chemical in the organism will be higher than its concentration in the environment [96]. When the bioaccumulated chemical passes from lower to higher trophic levels through the food chain, successively greater pesticide concentrations emerge in animals of higher trophic level. This phenomena is called biomagnification. The offspring of top predators can also become contaminated, mainly in the case of marine mammals, because they can consume milk with extremely high fat and pesticides content [5].
Application of pesticide involves not only the active ingredient but also the whole formulation. Therefore, the environment and the human are exposed to both the active and inert ingredients. Although inert ingredients have no pesticidal activity, facilitate application of the pesticides – they enhance the active compound penetration into the target organism as well as the toxic action. Hence, the inert ingredients raise the formulation toxicity even in non-target organisms [35]. One example is the formulation of glyphosate, which is an active ingredient. It contributes a little to the total toxicity of the formulated product, particularly in the case of aquatic organisms, which are more sensitive to surface-active substances [97].
The categorization of pesticides commonly relies on their persistence in the environment. Organochlorine pesticides are persistent, whereas organophosphates, carbamates, phenoxyacid derivatives, chloroacetanilides, pyrethroids, and others are non-persistent. Compared with persistent pesticides, non-persistent chemicals have much shorter environmental half-lives and do not tend to bioaccumulate. Nevertheless, because of the heavy agricultural use of these chemicals, exists concern about their presence in the environment [14].
The non-persistent pesticides organophosphorus and carbamates act on acetylcholinesterase. The presence of this enzyme in insects, birds, fish, and all mammals allows these pesticides to reach both target and non-target organisms. [98]. Pesticides such as organophosphorus and carbamates can affect numerous teleost behaviors [99]. The pesticides that inhibit acetylcholinesterase are polar and water soluble. Moreover, their metabolism in the body is fast, and their degradation in the environment is relatively rapid. Therefore, organophosphorus and carbamates do not tend to bioaccumulate in aquatic species. However, the accumulation of these compounds in fish and invertebrates was reported long ago [100].
Organophosphorus compounds do not persist in the environment. However, their large-scale use and their decomposition rates in the environment cause these compounds to accumulate in soils, from where they subsequently enter groundwater and rivers [101]. A recent study detected the organothiophosphate insecticide chlorpyrifos in air and seawater in the Arctic, which demonstrated the long-range transport of this chemical [102]. Diazinon, another organophosphorus compound, frequently occurs in point sources (wastewater treatment plant effuent) and non-point sources (storm water runoff) in urban and agricultural areas. This pesticide is extremely toxic to birds and the aquatic life [103].
Organophosphorus compounds are acutely toxic, broad-spectrum pesticides. In the environment, secondary poisoning can occur when predators consume animals poisoned by these chemicals. Examples of contamination by organophosphorus are numerous. In Argentina in 1995–1996, approximately 6000 wintering Swainson’s hawks (
An example of carbamate contamination occurred with the pesticide, aldicarb, which polluted groundwater in the United States. Other carbamates such as carbaryl and its degradation product 1-naphthol have emerged in surface waters. The metabolite 1-naphtol is more toxic than its parent compound, and it has arisen in India [104].Methomyl, carbaryl and carbofuran, commonly used carbamates, have appeared in the aquatic environment [105].Carbofuran has commonly been associated with wildlife pesticide poisoning events when applied in the granular form. Apparently, birds mistake them for seeds [5].
Organochlorines have long environmental half-lives and tend to bioaccumulate and biomagnify in organisms. A series of evaporation and deposition steps as well as migration of animals containing bioaccumulated organochlorines can transport these compounds through the environment, carrying it to animals in higher levels of the food chain. These persistent chemicals thus occur thousands of miles away from their origin [14]. The properties of organochlorines like aldrin and dieldrin result in direct mortality of predatory birds, such as sparrow hawks and kestrels [5]. These chemicals have intensive use in agricultural and industrial activities, so they emerge across the world, including the deserted plateau and the polar zone [106]. The organochlorine chlorothalonil is a fungicide that has arisen in seawater and air in the Arctic as well as in snow cores in Arctic Canada. Endolsulfan, an organochlorine insecticide, has appeared in animals from Greenland like marine fish and mammals [102].
Despite the ban on many organochlorine compounds in the 1970s, some countries still fabricate and use chemicals such as DDT to control vector disease [98]. Other countries have replaced organochlorines with the less persistent and more effective organophosphorus compounds [107].
Pyrethrins and Pyrethroids are non-persistent pesticides used worldwide as insecticides in agriculture, forestry, households, public health and stored products [108]. Therefore, urban and peri-urban populations are potentially chronically exposed to these compounds [87].
Pyrethrins and Pyrethroids act on sodium channels in the nervous system of numerous phyla, such as arthropods and chordates [87]. Pyrethrins and Pyrethroids present low acute toxicity to mammals and birds and constitute one of the safest insecticides to man. However, at low concentrations these chemicals are acutely toxic to a wide range of aquatic organisms and insects [108].
Pyrethrins are natural compounds extracted from chrysanthemum flowers; pyrethroids are synthetic compounds whose structure resembles the structure of pyrethrins [87]. Light degrades these chemicals. Modification of pyrethroids over the years has enhanced their insecticidal activity and persistence in the environment [109]. Compared with pyrethrins, pyrethroids are more stable under light [108], which incurs increased environmental risks associated with their use [5]. Pyrethrins and Pyrethroids display high selectivity and easy degradability in the environment as compared with other pesticides, been a favored replacement for organophosphorus compounds [110].
Pyrethroids strongly adsorb to soil particles, but they can move in runoff with soil particles and reach sediments, consequently entering aquatic ecosystems and affecting aquatic organisms like invertebrates and fish [108]. Fish are highly sensitive to pyrethrin and pyrethroid products, and contamination of lakes, streams, ponds, or any aquatic habitat is a concern [109]. Moreover, some formulations contain additional insecticides, insect repellents, and solvents such as alcohol and petroleum, which increase pesticide toxicity [109].
Triazines basically consist of herbicide compounds, are relatively persistent and migrate easily through the soil into surface and ground waters [111]. In soil, they undergo degradation mainly in a microbial action, but the role of photodegradation is still significant [112]. Residues of triazines have emerged in soil, surface waters, and groundwater in areas where the application of agrochemicals has taken place [111].
Herbicides are often benign with regard to impacts on animals; however, these compounds can have toxic effects at concentrations found in the environment [5]. Furthermore, indiscriminate use of this herbicide, careless handling, accidental spillage, or discharge of untreated effluents into natural water ways can harm the fish population and other aquatic organisms and may contribute to long-term effects in the environment. Atrazine, a triazine herbicide, is one of the most often detected pesticides in streams, rivers, ponds, reservoirs, and groundwater [113].
Phenoxy derivatives basically consist of compounds with herbicide action. They are soluble in water and can pollute surface and ground waters. Phenoxy derivatives display moderate toxicity, but some chlorinated metabolites can be toxic to human and aquatic organisms [114]. In addition, the metabolites may have mutagenic and carcinogenic properties. 2,4-D and MCPA, which are also phenoxy herbicides, can undergo degradation by biotic and abiotic mechanisms. However, these processes may not suffice to reduce the concentrations of chlorinated phenoxy derivatives on many sites [115].
Regarding dipyridyl derivatives, the best-known compounds are diquat and paraquat, developed as herbicides and desiccants. Diquat is water soluble and persistent in the aquatic system. However, it can bind to soil, which reduces its mobility in the environment. Although herbicides are usually little toxic to animals, diquat is toxic to some aquatic organisms [116]. Soil adsorbs paraquat, which presents its leaching to ground water; soil microorganisms and photolysis degrade this herbicide [117]. The herbicide glyophosate bears glycine, which adsorbs to soil, undergoes degradation by bacteria, and has low potential for runoff. However, is it highly water soluble and emerges in surface waters. Glyphosate is little toxic to mammals, but the surfactants present in some formulations rise the toxicity of this chemical. Hence, some formulations, mainly those intended for aquatic vegetation control, can kill amphibians [5]. Many authors have demonstrated that glyphosate formulations can cause genetic damage in fish [97].
Dithiocarbamates (DTC) function mainly as fungicides that protect crops, but they also work as rodent repellents [118]. The intensive use of dithiocarbamates in agriculture often contaminates water bodies [119]. Ziram, one of the best-known dithiocarbamates, is toxic to aquatic organisms [120].
Other examples of chemical classes of pesticides exist. Alachlor and metolachlor belong to the group of chloroacetanilides. These herbicides and their degradation products have arisen in surface and groundwater [121]. Diuron, a urea derivative, can pollute freshwaters by leaching through the soil. It has appeared in marinas and coastal areas [122]. Additionally, trifluralin, a dinitroanilin, has emerged in Arctic air and seawater [102].
Therefore, a huge amount and variety of pesticides exist in the environment. Many chemicals that exist at low concentrations may not cause acute detectable effects in organisms, but they may induce other kinds of damage, like genetic disorders and physiological alterations that, in the long run, reduce the organisms life span [11].
7. Methods to detect pesticides
A wide range of methodologies exist to identify possible exposure to pesticides. When identification is necessary due to poisoning of a patient attended in the clinic, the general procedures include anamnesis, physical examination, evaluation of clinical signs, and diagnostic and toxicological analysis. If the investigation aims to qualify and/or quantify a possible pesticide, it is generally necessary to collect a sample and analyze it for the presence of pesticides and/or metabolites in biological samples (blood, liver, stomach contents) and/or the environment (air, water, ground). Selection of the test will depend on the purpose of the analysis. It is also essential to consider the financial costs of a method. Simpler tests are still important, – apart from been inexpensive, many offer high sensitivity, specificity, precision, and accuracy, all of which are factors that are crucial for reliable analysis [123, 124].
Prior to analyzes pesticides samples analysts have to go through similar steps: definitions of the analytical problem (target analyte and its properties), choice of detection methods (immunoassays spectrometry), sampling (how to collect and store the sample), sample preparation (solubilization, extraction, concentration, and separation), calibration (qualification and/or quantification of the analyte), calculation and evaluation of the results, and actions to complete the analysis [125].
Sample storage for long periods should ensure that no sample degradation or external contamination occurs. Well-sealed containers stored under refrigeration and protected from light are mandatory. To avoid any type of external interference during analysis, none of the employed materials should modify or degrade the pesticide in the sample. The analysis of pesticides, mainly in water, ambient air, and soil sediments, often requires a purification step to clean the sample and pre-concentrate the analytes, to improve the quality of the analytical results. The extraction process is a key analytical step – it extracts the desirable compounds for further separation and characterization. Liquid-liquid extraction, and pre-concentration procedures, such as solid-phase extraction and solid-phase microextraction, are the most commonly used methods, but other extraction methods are also applicable depending on the objective [126]. Extraction of residues from the sample matrix demands appropriate solvents for maximum extraction efficiency and minimal co-extraction of interfering substances. The extraction solvents must be highly pure. Blank tests help to prove that the matrix does not interfere in the analyzes. After extraction, a purification step removes the interfering substance with minimal loss of the analyte. The final solution should include an appropriate solvent for analyte determination by the selected method [127].
Below is a didactic description of the main separations and detection methods.
7.1. Physicochemical methods
Gas chromatography (GC), Liquid Chromatography (LC), and Capillary Electrophoresis (CE) constitute physicochemical separation methods.
When the analyzed pesticide is volatile or semi-volatile, GC still is the method of choice: it offers higher resolution and lower detection limits. GC is usually associated with multiple detectors whose choice will depend on the characteristics of the target analytes. GC is based on sample volatilization and introduction into a chromatographic column coated or packed with a solid or liquid stationary phase. A gaseous mobile phase elutes the analyte; this phase is inert, and does not interact with the analyte. The carrier gases should be pure and chemically inert, too, and the choice will depend on the detector. The commonest carrier gases are helium, argon, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen [128].
LC has emerged as a great separation tool. It allows for effective separation of nonvolatile and thermally unstable pesticides that are incompatible with GC. During LC, extracts pass through multiple adsorbent columns that can discriminate between the components of the matrix and target analyte. The degree of selectivity will vary according to the adsorbent present in the column (alumina, silica gel, or Florisil), mesh size, and activity levels. Columns can be used separately or in combination [129].
CE is a powerful tool to separate and identify a wide range of molecules. EC provides high resolution, and large separation efficiency. It requires small sample size and low solvent consumption analyzes is faster and operational coats are low [130].
An ideal detector should ensure adequate sensitivity, good stability and reproducibility, and linear response to various concentrations of the analytes. It should also operate in a wide range of temperature, have reduced response time (independent of the flow), and be easy to handle. The detector response should be equivalent for all the analytes or selective to certain classes of compounds. Ultimately, the detector should not destroy the sample. Unfortunately, a switch that exhibits all these characteristics does not exist, so it is necessary to select the detector according to the desired goal [128].
Several types of detectors are commercially available. They can come coupled to the separation device. These detectors use photometric or fluorimetric methods, thermal conductivity, diode array detection, electrons capture, atomic absorption, or pesticides mass/charge evaluation. The latter method is currently in evidence due because it is highly sensitive, offers autonomy, and performs a variety of functions. Electron capture and mass spectrometry are the most often used to detect pesticides.
The electron capture detector (ECD) is usually employed to search for organic pesticides, because it is highly sensitive and selective toward molecules containing electronegative functional groups. It also detects masses in the order of pictograms and can analyze traces of pesticides. However, ED cannot detect compounds with low electron affinity. Its excellent properties are useful for analysis of pesticides in both the environmental area and hospitals. A detector called μECD is also available in the market. It is advantageous over ECD in term of sensitivity, stability, and robustness [131].
Mass spectrometry (MS) is based on the ionization, acceleration, and separation of the generated molecules and ions according their mass/charge (m/z) ratio. This Provides a typical spectrum that gives the relative mass abundance of the different ionic species as a function of m/z so, which permits unambiguous identification of molecules. Mass spectrometry is a confirmation technique that is less subject to misunderstanding. Nevertheless, it has a drawback – it destroys the analyte [132].
As mentioned previously, the choice of method will depend on the case. LC-MS and GC-MS are the methods that generally separate and detect pesticides most suitable. These methods play a very important role in the analysis of pesticides and related compounds and are applicable in several areas like environmental analysis, food safety, and occupational toxicology, among others. Because they can serve various purposes, these methods also help to detect compounds in different samples, such as water, soil, sediment, sludge, vegetables and fruits, and animals and humans tissues and fluids [124, 126]. Obviously, method will based on the needs and characteristics of the target pesticide, and each sample will have their own features, which will depend on their physicochemical properties.
7.2. Biological
Chemical analysis of isolated compounds is commonly used to monitor environmental pollution, but such analyses can be limited and expensive and cannot indicate the biological effects. In contrast, biological tests indicate the toxicity of a ride range of compounds or environmental samples, and are therefore essential to determine the environmental impacts of the presence of these chemicals [133]. Immunoassays and biosensors are methods related to the biological factor. Immunoassays are a powerful tool in clinical laboratories and one of the most widely applied analytical techniques. The reagents kits and the equipment necessary to perform immunoassays are commercially available and rely on fluorescent, chemiluminescent or other detection methods. Immunoassays can detect a wide range of compounds including drugs, proteins, and hormones; they can also identify and quantify the presence of pesticides residues in various samples such as natural water, food, and blood, among others [129].
Regarding biosensors, organisms such as
8. Summary of important points and perspectives
The chapter begins with an introduction about pesticides, citing the Second World War and the publication of the book ""Silent Spring"" by Rachel Carson. Even in the introduction, it is mentioned the Integrated Pest Management (IPM) and the risks and benefits of pesticides use.
Subsequently, the chapter presents the topic ""physicochemical properties and stages of intoxication."" This topic cites the physicochemical properties, the exposure, toxicokinetic, toxicodynamic and clinical phase of organophosphorous, carbamates, organochlorines, pyrethrins and pyrethroids, triazines, phenoxy derivatives, dipyridyl derivatives, glycine derivatives, dithiocarbamates, and others. In the latter group, the nanopesticides are mentioned.
The chapter also discusses the pesticides as inducers of oxidative stress and endocrine disruptors action of two important issues. Beyond, adress three topics differences: pestidas and human health, pesticides and environmental health, and methods of detection of these compounds. In the first, there are examples of intoxication from occupational, accidental and intentional exposure, besides decontamination methods. The second topic shows how a pesticide reaches the environment, and how it behaves. In other words, if hits the water, soil, and / or are biodegraded. Finally, the third topic addresses methods of detection of pesticides. Gas chromatography (GC), Liquid Chromatography (LC), and Capillary Electrophoresis (CE) constitute physicochemical methods. Immunoassays and biosensors are methods related to the biological factor.
Currently, there is a pursuit of a sustainable society, generating huge concern for human health just like the environment, this occurs due to action/persistence of pesticides in the environment, as well as its toxic effects to humans and other living beings. This pursuit for a healthier society tries to combat the toxic effects of pesticides, as they have caused a large reduction in biodiversity (mainly insects pollinators), and affect humans causing genetic mutations, Mutagenicity and carcinogenicity, reproductive damages as well as disturbances behavioral (depression and suicides). Faced with this problem, many governments have sought to measures to limit access to these compounds, aimed at protecting human and environmental health, such as work done by the governments of India, Western Samoa and Finland, which restricted access to pesticides and reduced cases of suicides in their countries [42, 134].
This concern can also be viewed on the growing interest of researchers and regulatory agencies regarding research related to biopesticides and biological control of pests, also seeking the quality of environmental and human health mainly in the near future [135]. .

azocleantech,https://www.azocleantech.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=563 ,"Canada is largely defined by its size, as the second-largest country in the world, and sparse population, with about 75 percent of Canadians living within 100 miles of the United States of America. The Canadian population is also highly concentrated around its cities, outside of southern Ontario.
Canada is a large country with a landmass of 9,970,610 square kilometers. Being a large country, Canada has a wide range of ecosystems. Lakes and rivers cover 7 percent of the country. The southern part of Canada is temperate and the northern regions are sub-Arctic and Arctic.. In northernmost Canada only 12 percent of the land is suitable for agriculture due to the harsh climate, resulting in most of the population of Canada living within a few hundred kilometers of the southern border.
Canada’s culture and market-based economy very much resemble that of its southern neighbor, the USA. Some of Canada’s biggest industries involve the extraction of natural resources, including oil, gas, and uranium. The country also has strong banking and technology sectors.
Environmental Issues of Canada
With the Arctic warming faster than any other biome recently, Canadians are particularly concerned about the impacts of climate change. The country generates enormous wealth from its oil and gas operations. However, the oil and gas industries account for a quarter of Canada’s greenhouse gas emissions, with the oilsands being the most carbon-intensive.
The oil extracted in Alberta’s oilsands reserves is shipped in pipelines in its bitumen raw form. The debate about whether Canada should build new pipelines is still ongoing due to worries about climate change, pipeline leaks, oil tanker spills, and First Nations rights. The Keystone XL pipeline proposal was rejected by President Obama but has since been approved by President Trump. Other planned pipeline proposals such as the Enbridge Northern Gateway pipeline and Energy East pipeline have been abandoned.
A large amount of the Canadian population lives in urban areas and cities are notorious for their poor air quality. Environment Canada has singled out air pollution as a major concern as it affects wildlife, vegetation, soil, and water. The government agency has said air pollution from urban areas causes acid rain and contributes to climate change.

Canada is home to an abundance of fresh water, but the World Wildlife Fund has raised concerns about water usage and the damming of Canadian rivers. The WWF noted that Canada uses large amounts of water for agriculture, industry, and consumption. The conservation organization said Canada moves more water from one watershed to another than any other country in the world and this activity can be devastating to ecosystems.
Environmental Policies of Canada
Experiencing many of the effects of climate change first-hand, Canada has enacted numerous policies aimed at combating emissions. The Canadian Environmental Protection Act was introduced in 1999 to combat specific to air pollutants and has had many amendments and additions since its introduction.
To tackle greenhouse gas emissions in the electricity sector, the Canadian government has banned the creation of new coal-fired power plants. The government has also passed regulations that mandate lower vehicle emissions and more efficient fuel usage. In 2016 they introduced the Multi-sector Air Pollutants Regulations to limit the number of nitrogen oxides (NOx) emitted from gaseous fuel-fired non-utility boilers, heaters, and stationary spark-ignition gaseous fuel-fired engines.
Canada has also reached numerous environmental agreements with the international community. Canada was the first developed nation to ratify the UN Convention on Biological Diversity. In accordance with this treaty, Canada’s governments have moved to safeguard almost 10 percent of Canada's landmass and 3 million hectares of ocean.

Canada has also signed a number of waste management treaties, including the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants and the Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent Procedure for Certain Hazardous Chemicals.
Canada is also involved in major international environmental organizations, such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the North American Commission for Environmental Cooperation.
Clean Technology in Canada
While the clean technology sector in Canada has been expanding every year, the sector has not been expanding as fast as it has in other countries, resulting in the nation falling behind in the global marketplace. Canada is only ranked 16th among the top 25 exporters, with China, Germany, and the US taking the top three export spots. The federal government has invested $1.8 billion in clean technology, but some of that money will not be available until 2019.
According to a 2015 report from the research firm Analytica Advisors, Canada’s share of the international market for clean technology goods dropped by 41 cents between 2005 and 2013. In 2015 the industry had $13.27 billion in revenues but retained earnings have declined every year for the last five years.
Céline Bak, president of Analytica Advisors, said leading clean technology countries are pursuing a more holistic approach beyond financing startup companies. The Canadian government has put forward a robust financing program for clean technology that is largely funneled to the not-for-profit organization, Sustainable Development Technology Canada (SDTC).
Canada: Environmental Issues, Policies and Clean Technology

Coal mines are important for Canada's energy needs. Canada produced 67.3 million tons of coal in 2005, 56 million tons of which were used for energy purposes. With the Arctic circle on its doorstep, Canada is well aware of the problems that climate change can cause. It works on an international level to encourage other nations to help slow the effects of this problem.
The SDTC has three different funds. Since 2001, the Canadian government has allocated a total of $965 million to the SD Tech Fund to invest in air quality, climate change, soil quality, and water quality projects. A derivative of the SD Tech Fund, the SD Natural Gas Fund supports the creation and use of new downstream natural gas technology. The NextGen Biofuels Fund backs the creation of demonstration-scale renewable fuel facilities, and although it is no longer accepting applications, the fund will continue to operate until September 30, 2027.
Government investments appear to be bearing fruit and Analytica Advisors has found that Canada’s clean technology sector is the nation’s fastest-growing. One company, Alter NRG, is developing waste-to-energy solutions that convert solid waste into electricity-generating fuel.
Another company, CarbonCure, has created a process that recycles carbon dioxide emissions from the making of concrete, which represents more than 5 percent of all global emissions. Hydrostor is a Canada-based company that can store electrical power as compressed air that can be tapped into on an ""as needed"" basis.
At the SDTC Cleantech Leadership Summit in May, Minister Bains announces a $26.3-million investment in clean technology. The funding will be spread across four new companies that join more than 300 others that SDTC has invested in since 2001. D-Wave, MEG Energy, MineSense, and Ionomer are expected to deliver environmental benefits to multiple industries and demonstrate our government’s commitment to helping businesses scale and compete on the global stage according to Leah Lawrence, the President, and CEO of SDTC.
A Clean Future?
Canada’s clean future largely depends on how the country regulates its large and growing fossil fuel extraction industries. These industries are a major source of Canadian wealth; however, they are associated with massive amounts of emissions.
Virtually sitting on the front lines of climate change, Canada will likely continue to push forward on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions as it pulls large quantities of emissions-generating fuels from the Earth.

Book Description
Environmental pollution is one of humanity’s most pressing issues and will remain so for the foreseeable future. Anthropogenic activity is disturbing natural cycles and generating pollutants that are altering the atmosphere, accumulating in the food chain and contaminating the world’s soils, rivers and oceans. Human health and ecosystems continue to be damaged by toxic metals, persistent organic pollutants, radionuclides and other hazardous materials. The Elements of Environmental Pollution provides comprehensive coverage of this essential subject. It explains the key principles of pollution science, assesses human disturbances of natural element cycles and describes local and global pollution impacts, from smoggy cities, polluted lakes and toxic soils to climate change, ocean acidification and marine dead zones. The book is informed by the latest pollution research and benefits from numerous real-world examples and international case studies. A comprehensive glossary provides clear and concise explanations of key concepts.
This textbook will support teaching and learning in environment-related university courses and will be vital reading for anyone with an interest in environmental protection.

Reviews
""The author writes clearly, targeting undergraduates who have some chemistry background. There is a good selection of end-of-chapter references, and most of them are from very recent research, mainly since 2000. This offers a very up-to-date viewpoint of the subject. The book also provides an unusually useful selection of figures and tables. Summing Up: Recommended. Undergraduate and graduate students.""
CHOICE, H. E. Pence, SUNY College at Oneonta
""This is an excellent primer that provides a refreshing approach to understanding contemporary pollution issues. It provides a useful systematic approach to examining the role of key elements that chiefly affect human and environmental health; combining their chemistry with relevant environmental processes. This is a very useful text book which should be on hand to all Environmental Science, Chemistry and Geography students.""
Crispin Halsall, Lancaster University, UK
""As our generation contemplates conditions being created for future generations, the topic of anthropogenic pollution of air, waters and soils will need to be closely evaluated and considered in order to protect and preserve the Earth's lifeforms, including humans. This book is an important extension of the literature on the role of human activities in changing the environment of the Earth and the topic is handled exceptionally well.""
Howard W. Mielke, Tulane University, USA
""I am very impressed by this book. It is clearly written, accurate and places pollution in its correct context. The book fulfils an important need and it is comprehensive and readable.""
J.N.B. Bell, Imperial College London, UK
""This book offers a fresh look at the interaction between the building blocks of our planet and human activities. Travelling through the periodic table, it examines the way we affect and may disrupt the life cycles of the most important and abundant elements necessary for life, and as a result influence our health and the health of the ecosystem around us. It is written in an accessible style whilst at the same time is underpinned by clear scientific principles.""
Hemda Garelick, Middlesex University, UK
""A highly readable text that is both interesting and informative. I recommend this book as a valuable resource for undergraduates undertaking modules in environmental pollution and, more broadly, as background reading for students taking environmental degrees.""
Peter J Shaw, University of Southampton, UK
""Identifying and comprehending the phenomenon of pollution requires that we understand the difference between natural material fluxes and those caused by mankind. This book, which classifies pollution processes according to individual elements, should be part of the library of all those concerned with environmental geochemistry and pollution.""
Martin Mihaljevič, Charles University, Czech Republic
""The simple, fluent writing style makes this an extremely accessible book, especially for readers without a firm background in chemistry. Complex concepts are explained clearly, with additional background information provided for non-specialists.""

Book Description
This timely book provides a thorough introduction to the inter-relationship of food and the environment. Its primary purpose is to bring to our attention the multiplicity of linkages and interconnections between what we eat and how this impacts on the earth’s resources. Having a better idea of the consequences of our food choices might encourage us to develop more sustainable practices of production and consumption in the decades ahead.
Although human societies have, over time, brought under control a large proportion of the earth’s resources for the purpose of food production, we remain subject to the effective functioning of global ecosystem services. The author highlights the vital importance of these services and explains why we should be concerned about the depletion of freshwater resources, soil fertility decline and loss of biological diversity. The book also tackles some of the enormous challenges of our era: climate change – to which the agri-food system is both a major contributor and a vulnerable sector – and the prospect of significantly higher energy prices, arising from the peaking of oil and gas supplies which will reveal how dependent the food system has become upon cheap fossil fuels. Such challenges are likely to have significant implications for the long-term functioning of global supply chains and raise profound questions regarding the nutritional security of the world’s population. Taken together the book argues that a re-examination of the assumptions and practices underpinning the contemporary food system is urgently required.
Environment and Food is a highly original, inter-disciplinary and accessible text that will be of interest to students and the wider public genuinely interested in and concerned by the state of the world’s food provisioning system. It is richly illustrated with figures and makes extensive use of boxes to highlight relevant examples.

Reviews
""A fine, wise and extraordinarily timely book that addresses agricultural and food systems worldwide from field to plate, and shows how precisely they can become more sustainable and healthy."" Professor Jules Pretty OBE, University of Essex, UK.
""Environment and Food is an extraordinarily accessible and comprehensive account of the ecological consequences of our agri-food systems. Colin Sage offers a timely and thoughtful guide to rethinking the relationship between food and ecology in an age of rising social and environmental uncertainty."" Professor Philip McMichael, Cornell University, USA.
""Although written as a textbook, this is a highly accessible and comprehensive account of the relationship between environment and food, both now and potentially in the future. The overall agenda has to be the creation of a sustainable food system, which the current agri-industry model is certainly not, especially when tied in with the global food industry and its pursuit of profit at the expense of the health of their customers.""

“This is a landmark deal. It brings Afghanistan closer than ever before to launching a formal peace process to end an interminable war. The US and the Taliban had a long and fraught negotiation. But as tough as it was, the next step will be even harder. A formal peace process will require a deeply divided Afghan political class to come together with a common vision toward peace, and the Taliban will need to agree to share power within a political system it has long rejected. In effect, the US-Taliban deal was the low-hanging fruit. Now the hard work begins.”

The Coalition’s founding members endorse the scientific consensus that failure to reach this milestone will result in temperature “overshoot,” in which emissions remain too high to hold Earth within 1.5 degrees Celsius of pre-industrial levels, leading to major and irreversible damages to the environment. Damage may be especially harmful for highly temperature-sensitive frozen components of the Earth system, with impacts ranging from sea level rise to infrastructure damage to food insecurity.
Arctic sea ice has likely reached its maximum extent for the year, at 14.77 million square kilometers (5.70 million square miles) on March 21, 2021, according to scientists at the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) at the University of Colorado Boulder. The 2021 maximum is tied with 2007 for seventh lowest in the 43-year satellite record.
NSF renews funding for 15-year NSIDC program to support Arctic community-led research and Indigenous Knowledge sovereignty
Since 2006, the Exchange for Local Observations and Knowledge of the Arctic (ELOKA) program at the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) has worked with Indigenous organizations, community partners, and researchers across the Arctic to facilitate the collection, preservation, exchange and use of Indigenous Knowledge and community-based observations of the Arctic. This year, the National Science Foundation (NSF) has renewed funding for the program with a five-year collaborative award to ELOKA, Calista Education and Culture (CEC), the Alaska Arctic Observatory and Knowledge Hub (AAOKH) at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, and the Yukon River Inter-Tribal Watershed Council to continue their work with Indigenous partners.
QGreenland, an open-source mapping tool that aids in the discovery and teaching about Greenland, is now available from the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) and its partners. This free geographic information systems (GIS) tool allows for the exploration of data on Greenland’s ocean, land, ice sheet, biology, communities and more, and can be used by a diverse range of users to examine the data available about Greenland’s landscape, ecosystem and communities. QGreenland is the first GIS data-viewing tool of its kind to focus on Greenland.
As climate change warms the Arctic more than twice as fast as the rest of the planet, new challenges abound for the communities that live in the region, including food sovereignty, coastal erosion, increasing shipping traffic and more. The National Science Foundation’s Navigating the New Arctic (NNA) initiative aims to improve our understanding of the rapid, dramatic changes taking place in the region in order to better mitigate these challenges. Beginning February 1, 2021, Alaska Pacific University (APU), the University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF), and the University of Colorado Boulder (CU Boulder) will host the Navigating the New Arctic Community Office (NNA-CO). Over the next five years, these universities will work together to provide leadership and support to researchers and Arctic communities to address this region’s biggest climate-related threats. .

Definitions
- Adjusted net national income > Constant 2000 US$: Adjusted net national income (constant 2000 US$). Adjusted net national income is GNI minus consumption of fixed capital and natural resources depletion.
- CO2 Emissions per 1000: CO2: Total Emissions (excluding land-use) Units: thousand metric tonnes of carbon dioxide. Figures expressed per thousand population for the same year.
- Climate change > CO2 emissions from electricity and heat production, total > Million metric tons: CO2 emissions from electricity and heat production, total (million metric tons). CO2 emissions from electricity and heat production is the sum of three IEA categories of CO2 emissions: (1) Main Activity Producer Electricity and Heat which contains the sum of emissions from main activity producer electricity generation, combined heat and power generation and heat plants. Main activity producers (formerly known as public utilities) are defined as those undertakings whose primary activity is to supply the public. They may be publicly or privately owned. This corresponds to IPCC Source/Sink Category 1 A 1 a. For the CO2 emissions from fuel combustion (summary) file, emissions from own on-site use of fuel in power plants (EPOWERPLT) are also included. (2) Unallocated Autoproducers which contains the emissions from the generation of electricity and/or heat by autoproducers. Autoproducers are defined as undertakings that generate electricity and/or heat, wholly or partly for their own use as an activity which supports their primary activity. They may be privately or publicly owned. In the 1996 IPCC Guidelines, these emissions would normally be distributed between industry, transport and ""other"" sectors. (3) Other Energy Industries contains emissions from fuel combusted in petroleum refineries, for the manufacture of solid fuels, coal mining, oil and gas extraction and other energy-producing industries. This corresponds to the IPCC Source/Sink Categories 1 A 1 b and 1 A 1 c. According to the 1996 IPCC Guidelines, emissions from coke inputs to blast furnaces can either be counted here or in the Industrial Processes source/sink category. Within detailed sectoral calculations, certain non-energy processes can be distinguished. In the reduction of iron in a blast furnace through the combustion of coke, the primary purpose of the coke oxidation is to produce pig iron and the emissions can be considered as an industrial process. Care must be taken not to double count these emissions in both Energy and Industrial Processes. In the IEA estimations, these emissions have been included in this category.

- Water > Freshwater pollution: Industrial organic pollutants per available freshwater
Units: Metric Tons of BOD Emissions per Cubic Km of Water
Units: Emissions of organic water pollutants are measured by biochemical oxygen demand, which refers to the amount of oxygen that bacteria in water will consume in breaking down waste. This is a standard water-treatment test for the presence of organic pollutants. The data from the World Bank, which represented BOD emissions (kilograms per day) were normalized by the combination of water availability per capita and water inflow availability per capita from the WaterGap2.1 model. In calculating the ESI, the base-10 logarithm of this variable was used.

- Climate change > CO2 emissions from electricity and heat production, total > % of total fuel combustion: CO2 emissions from electricity and heat production, total (% of total fuel combustion). CO2 emissions from electricity and heat production is the sum of three IEA categories of CO2 emissions: (1) Main Activity Producer Electricity and Heat which contains the sum of emissions from main activity producer electricity generation, combined heat and power generation and heat plants. Main activity producers (formerly known as public utilities) are defined as those undertakings whose primary activity is to supply the public. They may be publicly or privately owned. This corresponds to IPCC Source/Sink Category 1 A 1 a. For the CO2 emissions from fuel combustion (summary) file, emissions from own on-site use of fuel in power plants (EPOWERPLT) are also included. (2) Unallocated Autoproducers which contains the emissions from the generation of electricity and/or heat by autoproducers. Autoproducers are defined as undertakings that generate electricity and/or heat, wholly or partly for their own use as an activity which supports their primary activity. They may be privately or publicly owned. In the 1996 IPCC Guidelines, these emissions would normally be distributed between industry, transport and ""other"" sectors. (3) Other Energy Industries contains emissions from fuel combusted in petroleum refineries, for the manufacture of solid fuels, coal mining, oil and gas extraction and other energy-producing industries. This corresponds to the IPCC Source/Sink Categories 1 A 1 b and 1 A 1 c. According to the 1996 IPCC Guidelines, emissions from coke inputs to blast furnaces can either be counted here or in the Industrial Processes source/sink category. Within detailed sectoral calculations, certain non-energy processes can be distinguished. In the reduction of iron in a blast furnace through the combustion of coke, the primary purpose of the coke oxidation is to produce pig iron and the emissions can be considered as an industrial process. Care must be taken not to double count these emissions in both Energy and Industrial Processes. In the IEA estimations, these emissions have been included in this category.

Hi guys!
Despite our focus on the new A340-600 we have not forgotten about our existing products and we just sent the beta of the A319 V1.6 to our testing team. Once the A319 V1.6 is released, we will incorporate the same changes in the A321 and A321 NEO (with a couple of undisclosed NEO specific additions) for V1.3 of those products.
Release of the A319 V1.6 to everyone is expected for early in the week of April 26th.
We are very happy with this new update as it incorporates lots of major and minor new features. Here is the full list:
Changes from build 1299 (V1.5.2) to build XXX (V1.6)
Major new features:
- Pilot item database allowing the creation and storage of custom waypoints, including associated page reconfigurations on DIR TO, FPLN, RAD NAV page etc.
- Bleed system upgrade to a quantitative bleed model affecting fuel consumption and take-off thrust
- Support for LDA, IGS, Localizer Backcourse and GLS approaches
- Complete rework of the PERF pages to add EO mode information as well as climb/descent predictions to a given altitude
- Rework of the PROG page to include EO mode information including indication of OEI gross ceiling and predictive GPS function
Minor new features:
- When flying the IAE engine, the EWD now properly supports revision to N1 Mode
- TO performance calculator also determines whether packs need to be ON or OFF for the take-off.
- Complete redo of the SD pages ENG, BLEED, PRESS, and F/CTL for better representational accuracy
- FPLN page rework: Constraints are now shown prior to filing the INIT B page.
- FPLN page additional information: The Final approach slope is now shown
- Improved the lateral-directional handling qualities in manual flight
- Changes to altitude and speed constraints of the active flight plan create TEMPY flight plan.
- Added RAT and outflow valve to the external 3d model
Bug fixes:
- Corrected PFD speed bug location during Go Around
- Prevented waypoint sequencing when flying in HDG mode in opposite direction of FMS path at current TO waypoint
- Fixed ILS indication location on PFD
- Improved AP vertical target tracking when flying with high Angles of Attack
- Fine tuning of the graphical representation in the EWD.
- Speed target for flap 3 landings is back to VAPP
- Waypoints can now be added at end of FPLN directly on the FPLN A page.
- Various small bug fixes

We thought you should be the first to know! https://store.x-plane.org/King-Air-350_p_969.html
The Airfoillabs team, an X-Plane 11 addon developer from Brno, Czech Republic is about to release 1.5 update of their King Air 350. The team from Airfoillabs has spent quite a bit of time focusing on the physical model, avionics, performance and general handling of their airplane. 5th in line, this update introduces a new Quick Look feature, which allows the Pilot to use predefined views to navigate around the flightdeck. This feature should significantly reduce the workload for the pilot during critical phases of the flight.
Throughout the preparations of the update the Airfoillabs have cooperated with pilots and FI’s to consult the different aspects of the KA350 flight model, in order to give the immersive experience their customers are expecting.
One of the current KA350 pilots cooperating with the Airfoillabs team on their update is Charlie H., the guy behind the YouTube channel Chazflyz, who was kind enough to share his feedback.
""The King Air 350 by AirfoilLabs is an authentic replication of the real airplane. As a current King Air 350 pilot, I use this aircraft in X-Plane 11 to stay current with my procedures and checklist usage. The realistic functionality of every switch, button and lever and full fidelity flight model provide an immersive experience that is unmatched. I highly recommend this airplane in X-Plane 11 to those wanting a legitimate study level turboprop aircraft.""
Apart from the Quick Look feature, Airfoillabs have also addressed a number of feature requests as well as issues.
All IFR pilots will welcome adjustments they made to both the FMS, G530 and Reality XP avionics, where the EHSI will display correct information from the Flight Plan. Changes were made also to the A/P, which is now less sensitive to disengage during heavy turbulence, systems such De-icing, various switches operations now feel more reallike.
A big thanks for participation on this update goes to Chazlyz, to Michal “Dreamer” V., and to the IVAO CZECH REPUBLIC community.
Here are the full release notes for the 1.5 version.

A significant update of the ERJ Family by X-Crafts! This update is mainly focused on the FMS. Steve has been working on this for months because it required a complete rewrite of a huge part of the FMS navdata code. This new work will be the cornerstone of the new Authentic FMS which will be part of the new EJets family currently in development. There are also other smaller improvements on the aircraft, so check out the release notes!
Release notes:
FMS Converted navigation data to use X-Plane 11 native formats. GNS430 data is no longer needed, nor is a ""Custom Data"" folder required in the ERJ aircraft folder. You also no longer need updated GNS430 data in the X-Plane/Custom Data folder unless you have other aircraft that require it.The FMS now handles all waypoint types.New waypoint delete function on SID / STAR / ROUTE / FLT PLAN pages. More info below the release notes.FMS data entry process improvements:The Departure page only has one hot key to begin SID selection. Once you select your SID, you will automatically select your SID ENROUTE TRANSITION if any are available and you wish to select one.The Arrival page now only has two selections for procedures. STAR and APPROACH.Selecting the STAR will change the page automatically to the STAR TRANSITION selection page.Selecting the APPROACH selection will automatically change to the APPROACH TRANSITION page. Runway selection is optional, but will be made automatically if you select an approach.Waypoint entry has been improved with data checking that prevents selecting the wrong waypoint type for a given identifier.Navaid or FIX ID duplication detection has been added so that you can be sure that you're selecting the correct fix or navaid when there exists more than one valid possibility.
AVIONICS and CUSTOM COMMANDS Corrected the ALT ""hundreds"" knob change command.Added custom commands for the FMS and NAV buttons. Switching between NAV and FMS will now go back to the correct NAV which was previously selected, not the opposite.Added custom commands for the landing lights, the taxi and cockpit dome lights.
AIRCRAFT Added APU hot air effectsFixed the Metallic channels on all objects (metallic objects will appear metallic again)Added toe brake animationsAdjusted the Landing Lights direction and strengthUpdated the DCU buttons manipulators
More info on the FMS Changes:
As mentioned in the Release notes, you can now press the DEL key on the keypad and DEL will popup automatically on the SCRATCHPAD. If you are on the SID EDIT, ROUTE EDIT, STAR EDIT or FLT PLAN pages, selecting a waypoint and then the SELECT key will delete the waypoint without changing the page. This makes it possible to delete a lot of waypoints very quickly. There's a reason for that....
Procedures can be messy. You will need to refer to the appropriate procedure charts to determine what selections to make, and then how to clean up what you get. It is not often that STAR's in particular can be counted upon to produce a smooth waypoint flow from start to finish. This is one reason real FMS's have discontinuities in their waypoint flow.
So it's up to the pilot to edit what the FMS provides - every time you load a STAR. Fortunately, this is not often the case with SID's, but pay attention to what you get there as well.
In other news, the WebFMC now also includes the Tekton FMS!
HOW TO DOWNLOAD THE LATEST VERSION:
Option 1: Use the SkunkCrafts Updater. You will need the latest version of the SkunkCrafts updater or you might have some problem with the add-ons.
Option 2: Simply redownload and reinstall the files directly from the store.

We are delighted to announce that WebFMC Pro 1.7.0 (and 1.7.1, see below) has been released. It contains following features and improvements: Support for Tekton FMC in ERJ family of aircraft from X-Crafts (you can switch between Tekton and the default XP FMC by switching sides in WebFMC; note: Tekton in E-Jets v2.4 is not supported)Support for new FMC variant (A2) in Zibo’s 738Night mode (configurable via settings dialog option)Screen brightness controls (client-side only, brightness is not linked to the FMC brightness in the cockpit)For cockpit builderssome display aspects of WebFMC can now be configured via url parameters (forcing full screen mode, active side selection, etc.)lights state (EXEC, MSG, etc.) is now exposed via global javascript variablessee PDF manual for more detailsWebFMC menu entry and a basic status window added to the X-Plane plugin menuwebfmc-win.bin, webfmc-mac.bin and webfmc-lin.bin helper binaries renamed to webfmc-win.exe, webfmc-mac and webfmc-lin respectively and moved to bin/ subdirectory of the plugin.
This should help with MacOS BigSur firewall issue where it was impossible to pick webfmc-mac.bin file for firewall exclusion.Fixed a small bug with “Waiting for X-Plane…” startup message that sometimes wouldn’t get displayed depending on the timing of the initial connection and active FMC side.Linux version: because Ubuntu 16.04 is reaching EOL, the plugin is now built using Ubuntu 20.04 LTS as a base.PDF manual updates (new configuration options added, install section has been slightly simplified, brightness controls usage, setting options by url)Fixed Toliss font size issuesIncreased label lines font size in most aircraftRevised touch screen events for better support of generic mobile monitorsFixed saving Screen Only option into local storage to make it permanentAdded check for disabled Javascript within browser with proper error message
We would like to take this opportunity to thank @Steve.Wilson and @X-Crafts for making support for their great ERJ Family aircraft possible and sharing with us CDU background images.
For any technical questions, issues or other matters, please use our dedicated forum (do not post them here): https://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?/forums/forum/415-webfmc/
As always, the update is free for existing owners of WebFMC Pro - just re-download it from your Account page in the x-plane.org store. If updating from the older version, please make sure to backup your license file before removing the old version!
Try WebFMC Free Buy WebFMC Pro
UPDATE
We are very sorry for inconvenience, but we had to release WebFMC Pro 1.7.1 with important bug fixes, here is complete change log: Handle special “PLS INSERT APT WAYPOINT” message introduced in Tekton FMC with ERJs 1.4.0 update.Fixed CTD when WebFMC couldn’t find expected datarefs on startup, e.g. for a non-activated aircraftFixed “Dirty LCD” option not working regression bug.Fixed minor up/down arrow character alignment issue with Tekton FMC when using alternate font option.Fixed minor “Night mode” styling issue
For those of you who have already updated to 1.7.0 it is recommended to update to 1.7.1.
Please note, in case of Safari web browser some of the above fixes may require browser cache to be cleared (or a restart in case of iPad) to take effect.

Do you think that the Ozone Hole is a grunge rock club? Or that the Food Web is an on-line restaurant guide? Or that the Green Revolution happened in Greenland? Then you need The Cartoon Guide to the Environment to put you on the road to environmental literacy. The Cartoon Guide to the Environment covers the main topics of environmental science: chemical cycles, life communities, food webs, agriculture, human population growth, sources of energy and raw materials, waste disposal and recycling, cities, pollution, deforestation, ozone depletion, and global warming—and puts them in the context of ecology, with discussions of population dynamics, thermodynamics, and the behavior of complex systems.

We believe we can create a future in which our children and neighbours inherit the same planet we’ve enjoyed; where we deliver prosperity and well-being while avoiding environmental impact. Creating this future will require leadership, collaboration, and creativity, and will involve a diversity of new technologies, business ideas, and social innovation. Getting there is a challenge, but also an imperative.
At Carbon Engineering, our contribution to this future is a Direct Air Capture technology – more than 11 years in the making – that captures carbon dioxide directly out of the atmosphere.
Unlike capturing emissions from industrial flue stacks, our carbon removal technology captures carbon dioxide (CO2) – the primary greenhouse gas responsible for climate change – directly out of the air around us. This can help counteract today’s unavoidable CO2 emissions, and remove the large quantities of CO2 emitted in the past that remains trapped in our atmosphere.
At Carbon Engineering, we’re focused on the global deployment of megaton-scale Direct Air Capture technology so it can have the greatest impact on the huge climate challenge. Our team and partners around the world are working to build Direct Air Capture facilities that will capture one million tons of CO2 per year each – which is equivalent to the work of 40 million trees.
The public discourse is shifting. More and more corporate leaders and governments are committing to reduced, net-zero, or even net negative emissions. If your organization is among those leading on climate change, or evaluating options, we can help.
Our Direct Air Capture technology provides a range of affordable solutions that can help your business meet critical emissions reductions targets. From ultra-low carbon fuels to power your existing fleets, to permanent removal of your carbon emissions, we work with you to create a custom set of solutions for your sustainability and net zero plans.
CE was founded more than a decade ago with the mission to develop and commercialize affordable and highly scalable carbon removal technology. Today, our technology is proven, the leading commercial markets are ready, and we’ve formed key strategic partnerships to deploy our technology around the world. We’re now engineering the largest DAC plant in the world – a facility that will capture one million tons of CO2 directly from the atmosphere each year.
It’s our goal to have this first plant ignite an industry by demonstrating that megaton-scale Direct Air Capture technology is feasible, available, and affordable. We envision fleets of Direct Air Capture facilities working alongside renewable electricity, energy efficiency, and clean innovations in all sectors to fully tackle the climate challenge. .

| . Just over a decade is all that remains to stop irreversible damage from climate change, world leaders heard today as the General Assembly opened a high‑level meeting on the relationship between the phenomenon and sustainable development.
The meeting — held pursuant to General Assembly resolution 72/219 (2017) — will run through 29 March with a focus on protection of the global climate for present and future generations, in the context of the economic, social and environmental dimensions of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
“We are the last generation that can prevent irreparable damage to our planet,” General Assembly President María Fernanda Espinosa Garcés (Ecuador) warned the gathering in her opening remarks, stressing that 11 years are all that remain to avert catastrophe. Highlighting the meeting’s theme, Ms. Espinosa called for an intergenerational approach to climate change. “Climate justice is intergenerational justice,” she said, calling on States to act collectively and responsibly.
Pointing to intensified calls by youth leaders for action on climate change, she said that 2019 must be a year of climate action at all levels. Drawing inspiration from the thousands of students worldwide demanding tangible action, she called on world leaders to make 2020 the last year carbon emissions increase due to human activities. To achieve these goals, people worldwide must change their patterns of consumption, she said, noting that, every year, 1.3 billion tons of food are wasted as some 2 billion people suffer of hunger and malnutrition.
Further echoing the global youth’s call to action was United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres, who said young people are demanding that today’s leaders act on behalf of future generations. “We must address this global emergency with ambition and urgency,” he stressed, remarking that climate change threatens decades of development progress and plans for inclusive sustainable development.
Noting that “hundreds of thousands — perhaps millions” of people have been affected by cyclone Idai in Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe, he said such events are becoming more frequent and will become worse without urgent, immediate action. He announced the convening of a climate action summit, calling on leaders to meet in New York on 23 September with concrete, realistic plans to enhance nationally determined contributions by 2020.
Pointing to agents of change, he stressed the importance of the role of women as key decisions makers, adding that the summit will assemble Governments, the private sector, local authorities and other organizations.
Addressing the real‑life impact of climate change was Shedona Richardson, youth representative of Grenada. To her, climate change and global warming were ambiguous terms until her life, and that of her fellow Grenadians, was forever altered by Hurricane Ivan in 2004. “That was the day mother nature fought back after being treated so unkindly for so long,” she said, adding that the international community is failing to act as small island developing States face the existential threat of climate change. Addressing the heads of State and Government present at the meeting, she said: “Our future is in your hands, do not let the hope of the world be in vain.”
Immediately following opening remarks, the Assembly held a fireside chat that touched on the achievements of the Twenty-third and Twenty-fourth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change — held in Bonn, Germany, and Katowice, Poland, respectively, as well as the expectations for the Twenty-fifth conference to be held in Chile from 2 to 13 December.
During that discussion, Fiji’s Prime Minister Josaia Voreqe Bainimarama, who served as President of the Twenty-third Conference of the Parties, said that, while the gathering featured disagreements and finger pointing, the spirit of cooperation and understanding prevailed. Michał Kurtyka, Secretary of State at the Ministry for Energy and Environment of Poland and President of the Twenty‑fourth Conference, said that a people-centred approach to climate change mitigation emerged in Katowice. For her part, Carolina Schmidt, Minister for Environment of Chile and President of the upcoming Twenty-fifth Conference, said discourse must now shift towards change and action with the understanding that climate change and poverty are linked.
The meeting also featured two panel discussions: one on synergies between climate and sustainable development agendas and another on means of implementation.
During the first discussion panellists, Member States and civil society representatives asserted that the time for discourse has passed. “Now is the time for action,” said Krishnee Appadoo, youth representative of Mauritius, pointing to the direct impact climate change is having on small island developing States, women and young people. Such action must be based on a new narrative that promotes systemic change, said Manish Bapna, Executive Vice-President of the World Resources Institute.
Throughout the second discussion, panellists stressed the need to promote technology transfers, provide targeted development assistance and create favourable financing packages that allow vulnerable States to adapt to, and mitigate, climate change. Panellist Javier Manzanares, Executive Director of the Green Climate Fund, said helping developing countries access climate financing is the Fund’s priority and over the past three years its portfolio has included 102 projects worth $5 billion.
The Assembly will reconvene at 10 a.m. on Friday, 29 March, to resume the high-level meeting.
Opening Remarks
MARÍA FERNANDA ESPINOSA GARCÉS (Ecuador), President of the General Assembly, warned the Assembly that “we are the last generation that can prevent irreparable damage to our planet”. Worldwide, thousands of students are mobilizing around the message that we do not have a planet B and there is no future without a planet, she said, calling for their pleas not to fall on deaf ears. Against that backdrop, she stressed the need to act. “Eleven years is all we have ahead of us to change our direction,” she said, citing the findings of the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report. “2019 must be the year of climate action at all levels,” she stressed.
She called for a change in global patterns of consumption. Every year 1.3 billion tons of food are wasted as some 2 billion people suffer of hunger and malnutrition. Development in harmony with nature is possible and sustainability efforts must incorporate cities — where 70 per cent of global carbon emissions are produced. “I invite you all to commit to 2020 being the last year carbon emissions increase due to human activities,” she said, noting that achieving the Sustainable Development Goals requires meeting climate benchmarks. Inaction in the face of climate change will lead to deteriorating global health standards. She concluded by calling for an intergenerational approach to climate change. Children, adults and older persons all live in the same house and must look after it by working together. “Climate justice is intergenerational justice,” she said, adding that States must act collectively and responsibly.
ANTÓNIO GUTERRES, Secretary-General of the United Nations, said no country or community is immune to climate-related devastation, with the poor and vulnerable the first to suffer the worst hit. Pointing to the “hundreds of thousands — perhaps millions” of people affected by cyclone Idai in Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe, he noted such events are becoming more frequent and will become worse without urgent, immediate action. Climate change threatens decades of development progress and plans for inclusive sustainable development. Facing increased poverty, food insecurity, water stress and environmental damage, he said: “We have no excuse not to act.” He further noted that humankind has the tools to address the crisis in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris Agreement on climate change. “But tools are no use if you don’t use them,” he stressed, adding: “We need action, ambition and political will.”
Citing the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s 2018 special report and its warning that humankind has less than 12 years to avoid potentially irreversible climate disruption, he announced the convening of a climate action summit, calling on leaders to meet in New York on 23 September with concrete, realistic plans to enhance nationally determined contributions by 2020. He also asked them to demonstrate how to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 45 per cent over the next decade and achieve net zero global emissions by 2050, to ensure no one is disadvantaged by climate action and to demonstrate how it leads to job creation, lower air pollution and improved public health. “We all know that the green economy is the future, but we must make sure that everyone benefits, and no one is left behind,” he said.
He stressed the importance of the role of women as key decisions-makers, adding that the summit will assemble Governments, the private sector, local authorities and other organizations. Noting a “growing momentum for transformational change”, he pointed to new, less costly technologies, such as solar and onshore wind power, and called for an end to subsidies for fossil fuels, enacting real carbon pricing, and closing coal plants. Future vast global infrastructure investment must be sustainable and climate-friendly. Young people are demanding that today’s leaders act on behalf of future generations. “I echo that demand,” he said, adding that: “We must address this global emergency with ambition and urgency.”
SHEDDONA RICHARDSON, youth representative of Grenada, said climate change, global warming and the greenhouse gas effect were ambiguous terms until her life was affected by Hurricane Ivan in 2004. “That was the day mother nature fought back after being treated so unkindly for so long,” she said. The Caribbean faces intensifying storm seasons and small countries are struggling to cope with that changing reality. “The impacts of climate change are our new normal,” she said, adding that world leaders are failing to act. Small island developing States know climate change is a reality which represents an existential risk and that sustainable development efforts must incorporate climate change initiatives. The General Assembly’s meeting gives youth leaders hope that global leaders understand the time for action is now. “Our future is in your hands, do not let the hope of the world be in vain,” she concluded.
Conference of the Parties Fireside Chat
The General Assembly then held a fireside chat of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Moderated by Patricia Espinosa, Executive Secretary of the Convention, it featured Josaia Voreqe Bainimarama, Prime Minister of Fiji; Michał Kurtyka, Secretary of State at the Ministry for Energy and Environment of Poland; and Carolina Schmidt, Minister for Environment of Chile.
Ms. ESPINOSA, noted that, as in a family, the parties had experienced disagreements but that discussions were ultimately successful, laying the groundwork for the Twenty-fourth Conference of the Parties to the Conference, which took place in Katowice, Poland, in December 2018, and the Twenty-fifth Conference, to take place in Santiago, Chile, in December 2019, known as COP24 and COP25, respectively. The process had demonstrated that multilateralism is alive and ready to address the challenges of climate change, but there is no time to lose, she said.
Mr. BAINIMARAMA, who served as President of the Twenty-third Conference of the Parties to the Conference, which took place in Bonn, Germany, in November 2017, known as COP23, noted that discussions were conducted not with finger-pointing but with empathy and understanding. The exchange of ideas was inspiring, and his country had prepared a report summarizing the exchange of ideas. “The time for talking and listening must now give way to action,” he said, noting that three years after the Paris Agreement, the world is facing worsening climate impacts. Global warming is approaching 3°C above pre-industrial levels. Technologies exist to de-carbonize, he said, but political will is missing.
Ms. ESPINOSA then asked about the results of the discussions in Katowice.
Mr. KURTYKA, who served as President of COP24, responded that in its wake global climate governance is in place, but implementation is the new direction. People, technology and nature are the three elements involved in change. He highlighted the people-centred approach emerging from Katowice and called for a just transition that leaves no people behind, pointing towards the upcoming climate action summit in New York and COP 25 as key moments in addressing the issue.
Ms. ESPINOSA asked what the implementation expectations were for COP25 set to be held in Chile from 2 to 13 December.
Ms. SCHMIDT, President of COP25, called for change and action, stressing that climate action must be linked to long-term development and poverty reduction. She called for increased focus on “ambition, mitigation and adaptation” when considering implementation efforts.
Ms. ESPINOSA closed the fireside chat by asking panellists what one word they would use to motivate youth leaders.
Mr. BAINIMARAMA said “more ambition”.
Mr. KURTICA told youth leaders “you are the voters of tomorrow, use your power”.
Ms. SCHMIDT called on them to “pursue action for change”.
Panel I
In the afternoon, the General Assembly held a high-level panel discussion on “Synergies between climate and sustainable development agendas”, moderated by Inga Rhonda King (Saint Vincent and the Grenadines), President of the Economic and Social Council. The discussion featured presentations by Thani bin Ahmed Al Zeyoudi, Minister for Climate Change and Environment of the United Arab Emirates; Martha Delgado, Undersecretary for Multilateral Affairs and Human Rights of Mexico; Mary Robinson, Chair of The Elders Group and former President of Ireland; Krishnee Appadoo, youth representative of Mauritius; and Manish Bapna, Executive Vice-President of the World Resources Institute.
Ms. KING said climate change can bring devastating consequences to small island developing States. The direct impact of climate change hits the poorest nations hardest as they lack resources to properly mitigate the phenomenon. She said a number of high-level meetings on climate change are scheduled for September and share the goal of accelerating action towards sustainable development.
Mr. AL ZEYOUDI said the United Arab Emirates has adopted a whole-of-Government approach for the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals that includes initiatives to engage with myriad stakeholders at the national and international levels. “The United Arab Emirates is well aware of the impacts of climate change,” he said, noting that the country’s location makes it vulnerable to water shortages. A national climate change plan is preparing the United Arab Emirates to transition towards a green economy, he said, calling for the inclusion of the private sector, academia and youth in climate-related summits. Half of the population is under the age of 35 and the United Arab Emirates was among the first countries to appoint a Minister for Youth, he noted.
Ms. DELGADO said Mexico has seized the opportunity to participate in climate-related activities within the United Nations. Urging stakeholders to transition efforts towards implementation initiatives, she said Mexico is developing a road map to integrate social justice and environmental protection. States must recognize the interdependence of the Sustainable Development Goals, she said, adding that “climate change has the potential to reverse development gains and aggravate intergenerational poverty”. Mexico is promoting the integration of stakeholders as a means to identify new opportunities emerging from climate action. Citing a Government report, she said benefits of such activities include increased productivity and improvements in public health indicators. Further, the President’s Office is conducting a study to quantify the benefits of climate action, including how preventable deaths can be reduced by improving public transit networks.
Ms. ROBINSON said the debate on climate change is evolving and the seriousness of the situation is being acknowledged. “We will create the best synergies between climate and the Sustainable Development Goals through the lens of intergenerational dialogue,” she said, noting that even school children are becoming involved in climate action. “We are not preparing a safe future for our children and grandchildren,” she stressed, calling on every person on earth to take the issue of climate change personally.
Ms. APPADOO said all those convened at the meeting are concerned about the future of the planet. “Now is the time for action,” she said, pointing to the direct impact climate change is having on small island developing States, women and young people. For climate action to succeed it must account for the needs of all affected communities, she noted, adding that the University of Mauritius is set to host a multi-stakeholder climate justice conference. Such efforts allow for genuine action that recognizes the link between climate action and the Sustainable Development Goals. “More often than not, the voices of young people are not heard,” she said, urging leaders to learn from the global youth. “If we want real change we must bring all relevant actors together,” she concluded.
Mr. BAPNA said the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is a real triumph. However, the international community is not on track to meet its goals or those set forth in the Paris Agreement. Across most areas progress has been insufficient. He suggested the use of an integrated narrative that brings the Sustainable Development Goals and climate action together in an exciting way that promotes systemic changes. “We have to reimagine the energy system and cities,” he said, calling for greater awareness of intergenerational equity. Such a narrative needs to accord proper attention to the institutions capable of delivering on the 2030 Agenda and Paris Agreement. He pointed to the shift towards a green economy in India as an example of best practice and said upcoming high-level meetings provide a stage to catalyze greater action.
The floor was then opened for respondents.
PETTERI TAALAS, Secretary-General of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), noted the recent Cyclone Idai in Mozambique, Malawai and Zimbabwe, oceans warming by half a degree, and the most expensive hurricane season in Caribbean history, all of which demonstrate a worsening situation demanding action. He highlighted that the past four years have been the warmest in history and greenhouse gases have increased by 2.7 per cent. Meanwhile, only 15 per cent of global energy is sourced from nuclear, hydro and renewable power. Without concrete action, the planet will continue to get warmer. Turning to population growth, he said Africa may have 4 billion inhabitants by the end of the century. Echoing other speakers, he called for more involvement by young people.
OMAR FIGUEROA, Minister for State of the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, Fisheries, the Environment, Sustainable Development and Immigration of Belize, said Governments alone cannot solve the problem and the private sector and youth must be involved. However, he noted there is evidence “that we are moving in the right direction”. He called for every individual to take the issue personally, then collectively positive changes can be achieved. The Sustainable Development Goals are integral to mitigating the effects of climate change, but a warming planet will make the Goals impossible to realize. Statistics suggest vulnerable countries such as small island developing States receive a mere 2 per cent of climate funding.
NORMA KASSI, Director of Indigenous Collaboration of the Arctic Institute of Community-Based Research, said indigenous people have sustained themselves for thousands of years, and must be included in implementation of all Sustainable Development Goals going forward. Indigenous people have a “law” to pass on information to younger generations. “We have a millennia of knowledge to contribute,” she said. Indigenous and all races of women are key to healing Mother Earth. “We have no more time to waste,” she added.
The floor was then opened for an interactive exchange.
LAURA TUCK, Vice-President of Sustainable Development of the World Bank, echoed the call to take steps that positively impact the most Sustainable Development Goals. She noted the importance of addressing the negative effects of new technologies like solar pumps, or how moving from plastic to glass bottles may increase emissions due to transportation.
The representative of Italy said the model of development must be rethought. His country has a national strategy for sustainable development that integrates climate issues, looking all the way to 2050, and two months ago established a Centre for Climate and Sustainable Development in Rome. He noted that Africa continues to be the continent most affected by climate change.
The representative of the Inter-Parliamentary Union expressed worry that the right synergy does not exist in the economic model, and that the international community is still thinking of a technological solution. The world must escape this growth model, which persists even in United Nations debates. “We need an economic model of hand-me-downs,” he said.
The representative of Mexico stressed the need for a commitment to real action, citing the World Bank’s position on a whole sustainability perspective.
The representative of the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN-Women) reiterated the need for synergies between climate actions and sustainable development. She said there is a tendency to work in silos, and despite improvements in including gender requirements in proposals, real implementation of them is lacking.
A civil society representative echoed Ms. Robinson’s focus on youth, noting it has taken worldwide protests by young people to combat special interests that seek to uphold the status quo. This is a year for practical solutions, including realistic carbon funding.
Ms. KING, closing the discussion, said action requires strong partnerships and better coherence among multiple partners. “We need to take bold and innovative climate action to accelerate change towards the future we want,” she said.
Panel II
The General Assembly then held a high-level panel discussion on “Means of implementation”, moderated by Jayathma Wickramanayake, Special Envoy for Youth of the Secretary-General. It featured presentations by Hussain Rasheed Hassan, Minister for Environment of the Maldives; Yassmin Fouad, Minister for Environment of Egypt; Eva Svedling, Secretary of State at the Ministry for Environment and Energy of Sweden; Marilyn Ceci, Managing Director and Head of Green Bonds of J.P. Morgan; and Javier Manzanares, Executive Director of the Green Climate Fund.
Ms. WICKRAMANAYAKE said climate change is the most pressing challenge facing the international community and the situation will continue to deteriorate if further action is not taken. “We put the world in this emergency and we must be the ones to solve the problem,” she said, noting that inclusion is essential to developing effective climate strategies. She asked Ms. Svedling what policy interventions are needed to achieve emission cuts and how intergenerational equity factors into those strategies.
Ms. SVEDLING said the Swedish Parliament adopted legislation with the aim to reach net-zero emissions by 2045. In terms of private sector engagement, she said road maps are being presented by business sector representatives outlining climate initiatives. She noted that the European Union is the top provider of development assistance worldwide, with climate initiatives being increasingly integrated into funding priorities. Ms. Svedling said Sates must embed climate action in national budgets in order to establish a clear link with the Sustainable Development Goals.
Ms. WICKRAMANAYAKE, turning to Ms. Fouad, asked how Egypt is integrating low-carbon technologies.
Ms. FOUAD said such technologies yield positive results but developing countries require developed States to promote technology transfers to make them affordable. Further, Egypt launched initiatives that provide training for youth on the use of low-carbon technologies as a means to create jobs. The Government is seeking to increase its reliance on green energy sources, including by converting waste to energy. She called for low-carbon technologies to be packaged with favourable financing terms.
Ms. WICKRAMANAYAKE next asked Mr. Hassan what approaches were being taken in the Maldives to strengthen resilience and adaptation.
Mr. HASSAN said the Maldives has developed a number of programmes to address the impact of climate change. However, lack of resources means such programmes fail to be fully implemented. Among initiatives undertaken in the Maldives is a 2004 conservation project that fostered public-private partnerships to protect one of the most popular tourist destinations in the country. The Government has identified a number of atolls where such projects can be replicated and scaled up if the proper development assistance is made available.
Ms. WICKRAMANAYAKE asked Mr. Manzanares what percentage of the Green Climate Fund’s portfolio is dedicated to adaptation and how support for adaptation can be increased.
Mr. MANZANARES said helping developing countries access climate financing is the core goal of the Green Climate Fund and adaptation is the priority for the most vulnerable countries. The Fund has built a portfolio of 102 projects worth $5 billion that includes cross-cutting city programmes and partnerships with local financial institutions. He said the Fund steers its operations to meet the needs of developing countries. Ensuring adequate support for adaptation accounts for 54 per cent of the Fund’s grant portfolio, with funds primarily direct to the most vulnerable States.
Ms. WICKRAMANAYAKE then asked Ms. Ceci what opportunities for investment are emerging in the climate and sustainable development spheres.
Ms. CECI said early stumbling blocks in the green market emerged when trying to fulfil the needs of pension funds while meeting the goals of issuers. Obstacles lifted when issuers realized they could reach new markets. The priority now is creating new green financial instruments to service the industry. She pointed to the International Finance Corporation’s Amundi Planet Emerging Green One fund — which has taken money from pension funds in Europe to invest in emerging market green bonds — as an example of best practice.
The floor was then opened for respondents.
NEZHA EL OUAFI, Secretary of State and Ministry of Environment of Morocco, expressed sadness over unprecedented flooding in Malawi and Mozambique, noting no country is spared from climate change today. Morocco established the Marrakesh Proclamation calling for capacity-building and technology transfer. She called for a road map for financing for sustainable development principles. The Climate Centre in Morocco is helping Africa deal with the Sahel region, and the country is researching solar and new types of energy technology. Developing countries require a new quantifiable objective for climate action financing, she stressed.
PRAMISHA THAPALIYA, youth representative of Nepal, said youth will bear the brunt of the intergenerational problem. She noted the current mechanisms for climate finance are not available to youth organizations. Young people make up nearly half of the global population of 7.7 billion but are underfunded in the domain, and the Green Climate Fund must take note to redress the inequity. Nonetheless, young people are already taking significant action with limited resources.
The floor was then opened for an interactive exchange.
A youth representative highlighted the need for increased gross national income funding for youth initiatives, and to move away from fossil fuels.
A civil society representative asked how it will be possible for young people to be included in climate action and get visas to sit at the discussion table.
Ms. FOUAD responded to the youth representative that discussions for the Paris Agreement had led to a commitment of $100 billion in climate funding by 2020. She agreed that the Green Climate Fund must increasingly engage youth. Pointing to Earth Hour on 30 March, she said her country, Egypt, is firmly engaged in highlighting that effort by including celebrities and athletes in the programme.
Mr. HASSAN said the current generation has a duty to establish and ensure intergenerational equity in terms of resource conservation. His country considers that issue when developing any project involving resources. “We haven’t got much time” to rectify the problems, he said, which present an existential threat. If the current trend continues, global temperature will rise 2 per cent, meaning 70 to 90 per cent of Maldives coral reefs will be compromised, threatening the very existence of the country.
Ms. SVEDLING pointed to a fossil-free initiative in Sweden and the importance of multilayered discussion between unions, businesses, politicians and youth representatives. She highlighted the need for ambitious goals from every sector, including financial.
Ms. WICKRAMANAYAKE asked how to create more effective partnerships between Governments, civil society and the private sector.
Ms. CECI responded that those partnerships cannot be forced. She noted a lack of pressure on corporations to advance environmentally sound pension programmes. The Sustainable Development Goals, however, have been very impactful in the corporate world. She added that young people have a lot of power to raise their voices in that domain.
Ms. WICKRAMANAYAKE asked how young people can tap into the Green Climate Fund.
Mr. MANZANARES agreed on the need for a mechanism for a green youth portfolio and green equity fund. He noted that the Green Climate Fund operates in 150 developing countries through a country-driven approach, and every project must have a non-objection from the country. It does not directly fund, but works through, national entities. He encouraged young people to organize and access the Fund.
Ms. WICKRAMANAYAKE closed the meeting by repeating: “We are running out of time”. .
