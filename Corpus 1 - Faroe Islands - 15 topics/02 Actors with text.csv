How Our Trash Impacts the Environment
February 28, 2019
By Austin Downs and Richard Acevedo
The waste humans generate waste has been detrimental to our environment for quite some time now. Humans are generating too much trash and cannot deal with it in a sustainable way. Waste that is not biodegradable and cannot be properly be recycled is filling our oceans and landfills. Let’s take plastic waste as an example. A recent study found that of the 6.3 billion metric tons of plastic waste that has been produced, only 9% of that plastic waste had been recycled. (Find out more about plastic pollution and how you can help reduce your own waste.) In 2017, for instance, the Environmental Protection Agency calculated that the total generation of municipal solid waste in the United States just that year was 267.8 million tons. Compared with 2015 levels, it was a 5.7 million increase. All together, the amount of waste generated affects the environment in multiple ways: its contribution to the worsening climate crisis, its negative impact on wildlife and the natural environment, and its detriment to our very own public health.
Climate Change
The way we dispose of waste is troubling. What is worse, in this decade alone, it would seem that waste disposal has become more careless. What we have failed to do is to put into action the ideas we believe will help us mitigate or adapt to climate change. Case in point: the trash that is dumped in landfills releases methane gas. Taken one step further open landfills were found to represent 91% of all landfill methane emissions. The burning of large, open piles of trash in various parts of the world emits dangerous levels of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas that is heating up our planet. Researchers have calculated that approximately 40% of the world’s trash is burned in this fashion, posing large-scale risks to both our atmosphere and the people that live near these burning sites.
Wildlife
Ecosystems vary widely from location to location. However, one of the most outsize consequences of our global waste problem manifests itself in relation to our marine life and waterways. Simply put, it affects the people who depend on the ocean for their livelihoods. They cannot distinguish between what is or isn’t food. They consume the trash, which results in death because the aquatic animal could not process it. This affects fish, seals, turtles, whales, and many other aquatic animals, as scientists have also found many plastic fragments in over a thousand species. Due to ingestion of trash or plastics, starvation is usually the next step because some species do not have high acidic levels in their stomach to break down the object that they ingested. There are some animals that do but plastic fragments have been known to be able to last 100 years. When it comes to biodiversity, our waste problem is severely plaguing the health of the world’s species.
Public Health
Human health is at risk through our inaction. We keep producing large amounts of trash, we do not dispose of it correctly, and in the end that will be our downfall as it is for the environment and wildlife in the ecosystems we all share. We cannot prevent or promote longevity with how we treat our Earth. The more emissions that we produce due to how much trash we generate, affects us long term. One can develop diseases such as asthma, birth defects, cancer, cardiovascular disease, childhood cancer, COPD, infectious diseases, low birth weight, and preterm delivery. Bacteria, vermin and insects can also be added to the problem that trash causes.

Key Environmental Parameters
Carbon Dioxide
CO2 is part of the human metabolism. It is produced when, for example, carbohydrates are metabolized to generate energy. The produced CO2 is then transported out of the body by respiration. The CO2 concentration in the inhaled air is decisive for the metabolism. Depending on the level of the concentration in the air breathed in, various symptoms can occur that affect daily life and health. High CO2 concentrations in the air we breathe lead to concentration problems and fatigue. The performance potential of people in the room decreases constantly the higher the amount of CO2 in the air gets. Furthermore, CO2 concentrations relate to the potential of virus infections.
The level of CO2 in the air can be thought of as a ""traffic light"" system: Green is between 400–1'000 ppm; yellow is between 1'000–1'600 ppm and is where 80% of people are satisfied with perceived air quality; red is ≥1'600 ppm and is where there are detectable negative impacts on human health and well-being. At this level, the air quality is considered poor and the risk of viral transmission is increased.
Humidity and Temperature
Do you find it hard to breathe in your home some days? Are you more prone to headaches and asthma attacks during the summer months? You’re not allergic to heat - but you may have serious humidity problems in your home or office. When we talk about indoor air quality, humidity is one of the main things we’re referring to. Too high or too low humidity levels in closed spaces can lead to various issues. For example, bacteria and viruses that cause respiratory infections thrive in extremely high and extremely low humidity. Mold spores, dust mites and other allergens survive best in high humidity environments. Furthermore, higher humidity can increase the levels of noxious chemicals in the air, which may include ozone and formaldehyde.
40-60 % relative humidity is an optimal level for the immune system and our respiratory system. It reduces the spread of seasonal respiratory diseases and increases well-being. Scientists are therefore calling on the WHO (World Health Organization) to revise the global guidelines for indoor air quality with the petition 40to60RH. Click here to learn more about it.
Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs)
VOCs originate from a number of different possible sources, like building materials, tobacco smoke, people and their activities, and indoor chemical reactions. Exceptionally high VOC levels are typically found in new buildings or after renovation. Further, when using products that contain VOCs, such as air fresheners or cleaning agents, people expose themselves and others to high pollutant levels that can persist long after the activity has finished. A number of systematic human exposure studies have shown various adverse health
effects caused by exposure to elevated VOC levels. Among the effects reported by participants are dryness and irritation of the eye, the nose and the throat, headaches, and dizziness.
Sensirion’s powerful VOC Algorithm analyzes VOC events detected by the SGP40 sensor and maps them to a VOC Index. This VOC Index provides a practical quantification of VOC events relative to each individual sensor’s typical indoor environment. In this way, it behaves similarly to the human nose, which is highly susceptible to changes in odor, but it also detects VOC events that are not perceived by humans. The VOC Index indicates to what extent the indoor air quality has deteriorated or improved compared to the sensor’s typical VOC environment. Learn more about the VOC index at www.sensirion.com/sgp40.
Particulate Matter (PM2.5)
Particulate Matter (PM) is a complex mixture of solids and aerosols composed of small droplets of liquid, dry solid fragments, and solid cores with liquid coatings. Particles are defined by their diameter for air quality regulatory purposes. Those with a diameter of 10 microns or less (PM10) are inhalable into the lungs and can induce adverse health effects. A number of adverse health impacts have been associated with exposure to PM2.5. Short-term exposures (up to 24-hours duration) have been associated with premature mortality, increased hospital admissions for heart or lung causes, acute and chronic bronchitis, asthma attacks, emergency room visits, respiratory symptoms, and restricted activity days.
Indoor PM levels are dependent on several factors including outdoor levels, infiltration, types of ventilation and filtration systems used, indoor sources, and personal activities of occupants. In homes without smoking or other strong particle sources, indoor PM would be expected to be the same as, or lower than, outdoor levels. To know what the limits of PM exposure are, please consider official air quality standards. The US Environmental Protection Agency defines the AQI levels as follows: With regard to primary (health-based) standards for fine particles (generally referring to particles less than or equal to 2.5 micrometers (mm) in diameter, PM2.5), the EPA is revising the annual PM2.5 standard by lowering the level to 12.0 micrograms per cubic meter (mg/m3) so as to provide increased protection against health effects associated with long- and short-term exposures (including premature mortality, increased hospital admissions and emergency department visits, and development of chronic respiratory disease), and to retain the 24-hour PM2.5 standard at a level of 35 mg/m3.
Formaldehyde
Formaldehyde (chemical formula H2-C=O or often HCHO) is a colorless gas and the simplest organic molecule containing C, O, and H. It is highly reactive and has several natural and man-made sources. Formaldehyde concentrations are much higher indoors than outdoors and hence formaldehyde is qualified as a very specific indoor pollutant.
The most significant sources of formaldehyde are likely to be pressed wood products such as particleboard, plywood, or medium-density fiber board (MDF) made using formaldehyde-based resins. These materials are frequently used as sub-flooring and shelving and in cabinetry and furniture. Elevated formaldehyde concentrations can be present in freshly built, furnished, or painted rooms for months.
Health effects
In relevant concentrations, formaldehyde is a pungent-smelling gas, can cause watery eyes, burning sensations in the eyes and throat, nausea, and difficulty in breathing. Sensory irritation by formaldehyde has been reported for concentrations as low as 0.15 mg/m3 (120 ppb). High concentrations may trigger attacks in people with asthma. There is evidence that some people can develop a sensitivity to formaldehyde. It has also been shown to cause cancer in animals and formaldehyde is classified by IARC as carcinogenic to humans (Group 1).
Guidelines and Standards
The WHO has established an indoor air quality guideline for exposure to formaldehyde of 0.1 mg/m3 (80 ppb) as a 30-minute average. Local guidelines range from 8 ppb to 100 ppb depending on the environment and duration of exposure

Hot Topics
Reduce the risk of virus infection in classrooms
Ventilate indoor spaces regularly and thoroughly - this is recommended by the Federal Environment Agency to reduce the risk of Sars CoV-2 infection. This announcement is particularly relevant in view of the fact that the school has started again at full class size. For this reason, the supply of fresh air in the classrooms should also be as high as possible, regardless of other protective measures such as keeping minimum distances or wearing a mouth-and-nose cover. After all, droplets and tiny aerosol particles should play a decisive role in the transmission of Sars-CoV-2. Especially the aerosol particles that are produced when breathing, coughing, speaking and sneezing can float in the air for hours or days, according to current knowledge. Consistent ventilation can significantly reduce the risk of infection, but cannot provide 100% protection.
Petition ""40to60RH""
It has been proven that indoor humidity plays an important role in preventing virus transmission and improving the response of the immune system. Extensive research shows that a relative humidity (RH) between 40% and 60% is optimal to minimise the spread of viruses such as influenza. Scientists are therefore calling on the WHO to revise the global guidelines for indoor air quality.
The importance of indoor humitidy is crucial to us. As market leader in humidity sensing it is important to us to support petition 40to60RH.

Abstract
Background
Mining activities, including prospecting, exploration, construction, operation, maintenance, expansion, abandonment, decommissioning and repurposing of a mine can impact social and environmental systems in a range of positive and negative, and direct and indirect ways. Mining can yield a range of benefits to societies, but it may also cause conflict, not least in relation to above-ground and sub-surface land use. Similarly, mining can alter environments, but remediation and mitigation can restore systems. Boreal and Arctic regions are sensitive to impacts from development, both on social and environmental systems. Native ecosystems and aboriginal human communities are typically affected by multiple stressors, including climate change and pollution, for example.
Methods
We will search a suite of bibliographic databases, online search engines and organisational websites for relevant research literature using a tested search strategy. We will also make a call for evidence to stakeholders that have been identified in the wider 3MK project (https://osf.io/cvh3u/). We will screen identified and retrieved articles at two distinct stages (title and abstract, and full text) according to a predetermined set of inclusion criteria, with consistency checks at each level to ensure criteria can be made operational. We will then extract detailed information relating to causal linkages between actions or impacts and measured outcomes, along with descriptive information about the articles and studies and enter data into an interactive systematic map database. We will visualise this database on an Evidence Atlas (an interactive, cartographic map) and identify knowledge gaps and clusters using Heat Maps (cross-tabulations of important variables, such as mineral type and studied impacts). We will identify good research practices that may support researchers in selecting the best study designs where these are clear in the evidence base.
Background
On the impacts of mining
Mining activities, including prospecting, exploration, construction, operation, maintenance, expansion, abandonment, decommissioning and repurposing of a mine can impact social and environmental systems in a range of positive and negative, and direct and indirect ways. Mine exploration, construction, operation, and maintenance may result in land-use change, and may have associated negative impacts on environments, including deforestation, erosion, contamination and alteration of soil profiles, contamination of local streams and wetlands, and an increase in noise level, dust and emissions (e.g. [1,2,3,4,5]). Mine abandonment, decommissioning and repurposing may also result in similar significant environmental impacts, such as soil and water contamination [6,7,8]. Beyond the mines themselves, infrastructure built to support mining activities, such as roads, ports, railway tracks, and power lines, can affect migratory routes of animals and increase habitat fragmentation [9, 10].
Mining can also have positive and negative impacts on humans and societies. Negative impacts include those on human health (e.g. [11]) and living standards [12], for example. Mining is also known to affect traditional practices of Indigenous peoples living in nearby communities [13], and conflicts in land use are also often present, as are other social impacts including those related to public health and human wellbeing (e.g. [14,15,16,17]. In terms of positive impacts, mining is often a source of local employment and may contribute to local and regional economies [18, 19]. Remediation of the potential environmental impacts, for example through water treatment and ecological restoration, can have positive net effects on environmental systems [20]. Mine abandonment, decommissioning and repurposing can also have both positive and negative social impacts. Examples of negative impacts include loss of jobs and local identities [21], while positive impact can include opportunities for new economic activities [22], e.g. in the repurposing of mines to become tourist attractions.
Mitigation measures
‘Mitigation measures’ (as described in the impact assessment literature) are implemented to avoid, eliminate, reduce, control or compensate for negative impacts and ameliorate impacted systems [23]. Such measures must be considered and outlined in environmental and social impact assessments (EIAs and SIAs) that are conducted prior to major activities such as resource extraction [24, 25]. Mitigation of negative environmental impacts in one system (e.g. water or soil) can influence other systems such as wellbeing of local communities and biodiversity in a positive or negative manner [23]. A wide range of technological engineering solutions have been implemented to treat contaminated waters (e.g. constructed wetlands [26], reactive barriers treating groundwater [27], conventional wastewater treatment plants). Phytoremediation of contaminated land is also an area of active research [28].
Mitigation measures designed to alleviate the negative impacts of mining on social and environmental systems may not always be effective, particularly in the long-term and across systems, e.g. a mitigation designed to affect an environmental change may have knock on changes in a social system. Indeed, the measures may have unintentional adverse impacts on environments and societies. To date, little research appears to have been conducted into mitigation measure effectiveness, and we were unable to find any synthesis or overview of the systems-level effectiveness of metal mining mitigation measures.
Mining in the Arctic
Boreal and Arctic regions are sensitive to impacts from mining and mining-related activities [29, 30], both on social and environmental systems: these northern latitudes are often considered harsh and thus challenging for human activities and industrial development. However, the Arctic is home to substantial mineral resources [31, 32] and has been in focus for mining activities for several 100 years, with a marked increase in the early 20th century and intensifying interest in exploration and exploitation in recent years to meet a growing global demand for metals (Fig. 1). Given the region’s geological features and society’s need for metals, resource extraction is likely to dominate discourse on development of northern latitudes in the near future. As of 2015, there were some 373 mineral mines across Alaska, Canada, Greenland, Iceland, The Faroes, Norway (including Svalbard), Sweden, Finland and Russia (see Table 1), with the top five minerals being gold, iron, copper, nickel and zinc [33].
Many topics relating to mining and its impacts on environmental and social systems are underrepresented in the literature as illustrated by the following example. The Sami people are a group of traditional people inhabiting a region spanning northern Norway, Sweden, Finland and Russia. Sami people are affected by a range of external pressures, one of which pertains to resource extraction and land rights, particularly in relation to nomadic reindeer herding. However, there is almost no published research on the topic [34].
The literature on the environmental and social impacts of mining has grown in recent years, but despite its clear importance, there has been little synthesis of research knowledge pertaining to the social and environmental impacts of metal mining in Arctic and boreal regions. The absence of a consolidated knowledge base on the impacts of mining and the effectiveness of mitigation measures in Arctic and boreal regions is a significant knowledge gap in the face of the continued promotion of extractive industries. There is thus an urgent need for approaches that can transparently and legitimately gather research evidence on the potential environmental and social impacts of mining and the impacts of associated mitigation measures in a rigorous manner.
Stakeholder engagement
This systematic map forms a key task within a broader knowledge synthesis project called 3MK (Mapping the impacts of Mining using Multiple Knowledges, https://osf.io/cvh3u/). The stakeholder group for this map includes representatives of organisations affected by the broader 3MK project knowledge mapping project or who have special interests in the project outcome. We define stakeholders here as all individuals or organisations that might be affected by the systematic map work or its findings [35, 36], and thus broadly includes researchers and the Working and Advisory Group for this project.
Invitations to be included in this group were based on an initial stakeholder mapping process and soliciting expressions of interest (see Stakeholder Engagement Methodology Document, https://osf.io/cvh3u/). This group included government ministries and agencies such as the Ministry of Enterprise and Innovation, the Mineral Inspectorate (Bergstaten) and County Administrative Boards, the mining industries’ branch organisation (Svemin) and individual companies such as LKAB Minerals and Boliden AB, Sami organisations, including the Sami Parliament, related research projects, and representatives of international assessment processes, such as activities within the Arctic Council. Stakeholders were invited to a specific meeting (held at Stockholm Environment Institute in September 2018) to help refine the scope, define the key elements of the review question, finalise a search strategy, and suggest sources of evidence, and also to subsequently provide comments on the structure of the protocol .
Objective of the review
The broader 3MK project aims to develop a multiple evidence base methodology [37] combining systematic review approaches with documentation of Indigenous and local knowledge and to apply this approach in a study of the impacts of metal mining and impacts of mitigation measures. This systematic map aims to answer the question:
What research evidence exists on the impacts of metal mining and its mitigation measures on social and environmental systems in Arctic and boreal regions?
The review question has the following key elements:
- Population: :
Social, technological (i.e. industrial contexts, heavily altered environments, etc.) and environmental systems in circumpolar Arctic and boreal regions.
- Intervention/exposure: :
Impacts (direct and indirect, positive and negative) associated with metal mining (for gold, iron, copper, nickel, zinc, silver, molybdenum and lead) or its mitigation measures. We focus on these metals as they represent approximately 88% of Arctic and boreal mines (according to relevant country operating mine data from 2015, [33]), and contains the top 5 minerals extracted in the region (gold, iron, copper, nickel and zinc). Furthermore, these minerals include all metals mined within Sweden, the scope of a related workstream within the broader 3MK project (https://osf.io/cvh3u/).
- Comparator: :
For quantitative research; the absence of metal mining or metal mining mitigation measures—either prior to an activity or in an independent, controlled location lacking such impacts. Additionally, alternative mining systems is a suitable comparator. For qualitative research; comparators are typically implicit, if present and will thus not be required.
- Outcome: :
Any and all outcomes observed in social and environmental systems described in the literature will be iteratively identified and catalogued.
- Data type: :
Both quantitative and qualitative research will be included.
Methods
The review will follow the Collaboration for Environmental Evidence Guidelines and Standards for Evidence Synthesis in Environmental Management [38] and it conforms to ROSES reporting standards [39] (see Additional file 1).

We will search across 17 bibliographic databases as show in Table 2. Bibliographic database searches will be performed in English only, since these databases catalogue research using English titles and abstracts.
Web-based search engines
Searches for academic (i.e. file-drawer) and organisational grey literature (as defined by [40]) will be performed in Google Scholar, which has been shown to be effective in retrieving these types of grey literature [41]. The search strings used to search for literature in Google Scholar are described in detail in Additional file 3.
Search results will be exported from Google Scholar using Publish or Perish [42], which allows the first 1000 results to be exported. These records will be added to the bibliographic database search results prior to duplicate removal.
Organisational websites
In order to identify organisational grey literature, we will search for relevant evidence across the suite of organisational websites listed in Table 3. For each website, we will save the first 100 search results from each search string as PDF/HTML files and screening the results in situ, recording all relevant full texts for inclusion in the systematic map database. The search terms used will be based on the same terms used in the Google Scholar searches described above but will be adapted iteratively for each website depending on the relevance of the results obtained. In addition, we will hand search each website to locate and screen any articles found in publications or bibliography sections of the sites. All search activities will be recorded and described in the systematic map report.
Bibliographic searches
Relevant reviews that are identified during screening will be reserved for assessment of potentially missed records. Once screening is complete (see below), we will screen the reference lists of these reviews and include relevant full texts in the systematic map database. We will also retain these relevant reviews in an additional systematic map database of review articles.
Estimating the comprehensiveness of the search
A set of 41 studies known to be relevant have been provided by the Advisory Team and Working Group (review team); the benchmark list (see Additional file 4). During scoping and development of the search string, the bibliographic database search results will be checked to ascertain whether any of these studies were not found. For any cases where articles on the benchmark list are missed by the draft search string, we will examine why these studies may have been missed and adapt the search string accordingly.
Search update
We will perform a search update immediately prior to completion of the systematic map database (i.e. once coding and meta-data is completed). The search strategy for bibliographic databases will be repeated using the same search string, restricting searches to the time period after the original searches were performed. New search results will be processed in the same way as original search results.
Assembling a library of search results
Following searching, we will combine results in a review management platform (e.g. EPPI-Reviewer) and duplicates will be removed using a combination of automated removal and manual screening.
Article screening and study eligibility criteria
Screening process
We will screen records at three levels: title, abstract and full text. Screening will be performed using a review management platform (e.g. Rayyan, EPPI Reviewer, Colandr).
Consistency checking
A subset of 10% of all titles and abstracts will be screened by two reviewers, with all disagreements discussed in detail. Refinements of the inclusion criteria will be made in liaison with the entire review team where necessary. A kappa test will be performed on the outputs of screening of this subset and where agreement is below k = 0.6, a further 10% of records will be screened and tested. Only when a kappa score of greater than 0.6 is obtained will a single reviewer screen the remaining records. Consistency checking on a subset of 10% will be undertaken at full text screening in a similar manner, followed by discussion of all disagreements. A kappa test will be performed and consistency checking repeated on a second subset of 10% where agreements is below k = 0.6. Consistency checking will be repeated until a score of greater than 0.6 is obtained.
Eligibility criteria
The following inclusion criteria will be used to assess relevance of studies identified through searching. All inclusion criteria will be used at full text screening, but we believe that data type and comparator are unlikely to be useful at title and abstract screening, since this information is often not well-reported in titles or abstracts.
- Eligible population: :
We will include social, technological and environmental systems in Arctic and boreal regions based on political boundaries as follows (this encompasses various definitions of boreal zones, rather than any one specific definition for comprehensiveness and ease of understanding): Canada, USA (Alaska), Greenland, Iceland, the Faroe Islands, Norway (including Svalbard), Sweden, Finland, and Russia.
- Eligible intervention/exposure: :
We will include all impacts (positive, negative, direct and indirect) associated with any aspect of metal mining and its mitigation measures. We will include research pertaining to all stages of mining, from prospecting onwards as follows: prospecting, exploration, construction, operation, maintenance, expansion, abandonment, decommissioning, reopening and repurposing. Eligible mines will include those of gold, iron, copper, nickel, zinc, silver, molybdenum and lead.
- Eligible comparator: :
For quantitative research; the absence of metal mining or metal mining mitigation measures—either prior to an activity or in an independent, controlled location lacking such impacts. For qualitative research; comparators are typically implicit, if present and will thus not be required.
- Eligible outcome: :
Any and all outcomes (i.e. measured impacts) observed in social, technological and environmental systems will be included.
- Eligible data type: :
We will include both quantitative and qualitative research.
- Eligible study type: :
We will include both primary empirical research and secondary research (reviews will be catalogued in a separate database). Modelling studies and commentaries will not be included.
For all articles excluded at title and abstract or full text levels, reasons for exclusion will be provided in the form of one or more a priori exclusion criteria as follows:
Exclude, not Arctic or boreal (population).
Exclude, no primary data (i.e. commentary, modelling article or similar) (study type).
Exclude, no comparator [for quantitative studies only].
Exclude, not mining or mining mitigation measures (intervention/exposure).
Exclude, not relevant metal mining (intervention/exposure) [this category is related to the above intervention/exposure exclusion criteria but will only be selected where all other criteria are met, facilitating expansion of the map in the future].
Exclude, not an existing mine (planned or unrealised mining activity).
Full text retrieval
We will attempt to retrieve full texts of relevant abstracts using Stockholm University and Carleton University library subscriptions. Where full texts cannot be readily retrieved this way (or via associated library inter-loan networks), we will make use of institutional access provided to our Advisory Team members, including: University College London, KTH, University of Lapland, and SLU. Where records still cannot be obtained, requests for articles will be sent to corresponding authors where email addresses are provided and/or requests for full texts will be made through ResearchGate.
Study validity assessment
This systematic map will not involve an assessment of study validity (an optional part of systematic maps), although some extracted meta-data and coding will relate to internal validity.
Demonstrating procedural objectivity
None of the review team has authored or worked on research within this field prior to starting this project, but members of the Advisory Team and project Working Group will be prevented from providing advice or comments relating specifically to research papers to which they may have contributed.
Data coding strategy
We will extract and code a range of variables, outlined in Table 4. All meta-data and coding will be included in a detailed systematic map database, with each line representing one study-location (i.e. each independent study conducted in each independent location).
Meta-data extraction and coding will be performed by multiple reviewers following consistency checking on an initial coding of subset of between 10 and 15 full texts, discussing all disagreements. The remaining full texts will then be coded. If resources allow we may contact authors by email with requests for missing information.
Study mapping and presentation
We will display the results of the systematic mapping using a ROSES flow diagram [44]. We will narratively synthesise the relevant evidence base in our systematic map using descriptive plots and tables showing the number of studies identified across the variables described above. For more complex data, we will use heat maps to display the volume of evidence across multiple variables (see “Knowledge gap and cluster identification strategy”, below).
We will display the contents of our systematic map database in an Evidence Atlas; an interactive, web-based geographical information system showing all meta-data and coding on a cartographic map.
Knowledge gap and cluster identification strategy
We will use interactive heat maps (pivot charts) to display the volume of evidence across multiple dimensions of meta-data in order to identify knowledge gaps (sub-topics un- or under-represented by evidence) and knowledge clusters (sub-topics with sufficient evidence to allow full synthesis). Examples of meta-data variables that will be used together include (this is an indicative rather than exhaustive list):
Study location (country or broad region) versus outcome.
Study location (country or broad region) versus mine type.
Study location (country or broad region) versus data/study type.
Outcome versus mine type.
Outcome versus data/study type.

dredgeyard,https://dredgeyard.com/news/dredging-the-environment/ ,"All About Dredging & the Environment
Dredging: environmental impact
Dredging is often associated with pollution, contaminated soils, CO2 emissions or other negative environmental impact. Yet, the positive perspective and nature improvements dredging can achieve are often overlooked. The word “dredge” itself is defined as the act of cleaning and clearing “the bed of (a harbour, river, or other area of water) by scooping out mud, weeds, and rubbish with a dredge” by Oxford Dictionary.
Accordingly, dredging is an activity, which to a large extent focuses on improvement of our society, businesses and even the environment itself. Furthermore, due to constant environmental and societal developments such as climate change, population growth and pollution, dredging is becoming an increasingly important protective process.
How can dredging improve the environment?
While there is a variety of dredging objectives, a large range of applications focus on improvement of the environment and nature protection. Some of these applications are discussed below.
Dredging rivers to prevent flooding
Due to natural weathering and erosion, sand, silt and debris are constantly washed downstream. Sediments gradually fill up rivers, channels or canals making them very shallow and creating blockage. As a result, waterways become inaccessible to ships. Furthermore, blockage can cause water to flow over the river banks, flooding the surrounding area. Therefore, shallow waters can have major impacts on local businesses and even become a safety hazard to the surrounding residents and wildlife.
River dredging is an example of an application with the objective of nature protection. It ensures not only waterway accessibility for ships, but also protection and safety of people and wildlife in the area.
Environmental dredging to clean contaminated soils
Currently, one of the bigger issues that waterways face are polluted and contaminated soils, which become an environmental threat. Contaminated soils can negatively affect the environment and its inhabitants. In this case, environmental dredging is an effective method to remove polluted sediments. The soils must be cleaned in a controlled and precise manner, without spreading the pollutants in the surroundings. Accordingly, dredging solutions are continuously evolved to ensure precise dredging, which will not harm the environment or the operators involved.
Mine tailing removal for environmental safety
Mining operations such as coal or gold mining can produce tailings, which are finely crushed rock and mineral byproducts of the operations. Tailings often contain leftover chemicals, which can be dangerous and must be regularly cleaned to not harm the environment. Storage and handling of tailings has become a major environmental issue worldwide, where dredging is an effective solution to protect the surrounding environment.
Dredging reservoirs for clean & safe water supply
Dams, reservoirs and lakes play an important role in our society. They provide power and drinking water, as well as act as an energy source and habitat for various plants and animals. Just as in rivers, natural weathering, erosion and pollution threaten these water resources by clogging them up. Sediments can also contain chemical precipitates, which are especially harmful to the environment and life. This is another example, where dredging provides an effective solution to ensure clean, safe and sufficient water supply for the environment and life within it.
Environmental precautions when dredging
As discussed above, dredging is often an efficient solution to cleaning and improving the environment. Nevertheless, some aspects of these dredging projects must be considered in order to ensure minimal negative impacts on the nature.
Dredging equipment
When it comes to dredging equipment – size matters, and bigger is not always better. In the dredging industry – dredger types & sizes vary from one-container-transportable to grandiose vessels, such as the Spartacus. It is immensely important to evaluate project conditions and choose the right equipment for your dredging project. An undersized dredger will not fulfil project requirements and can ultimately lead to additional costs. Choosing oversized equipment can unnecessarily break the budget. Furthermore, naturally, larger equipment requires more power and thus, has higher fuel consumption, which results in increased CO2 emissions. Therefore, aside from increased expenses, choosing oversized equipment can also needlessly harm the environment.
Types of dredging methods
Choosing the right equipment goes hand in hand with the right dredging method. Some dredging methods can be considered more environmentally friendly than others. Thus, it is important to evaluate what is the most sufficient method for both – project requirements and environmental conditions.
Water Injection dredging is one example of the more environmentally friendly dredging solutions. One of the key aspects of this method is the fact that it involves nature itself in the dredging process by using water currents for material transportation. Additionally, water injection dredging does not involve material removal from the ecosystem. This contributes to sustainability of natural ecosystems that are vital in natural waterway processes.
There are also a variety of economic advantages of this dredging method, though it requires very specific environmental conditions to be sufficient. Find more about water injection dredging here.
Dredged material as a resource
Whenever dredged material does not involve any pollutants, it should be considered as a valuable resource, which can easily be reused. Dredged, clean sediment can be used for a variety of different applications such as beach nourishment, land reclamation, soil improvement, construction materials and more. Multiple dredging projects with different objectives (e.g. maintenance and capital dredging) are often combined in order to achieve the highest benefit of the project. In this way, the environment is protected from immense impact of unnecessarily many dredging activities. Additionally, if not reused, dredged material is simply disposed of. This is an expensive solution, which can also harm the environment and habitats in the disposal areas.
ECO-friendly equipment
There is a variety of nature-friendly dredging objectives and precautions that can be taken to protect the environment. Nevertheless, it cannot be denied that dredging has certain negative impacts, as it is a form of interference with the ecosystem. Due to this, the dredging industry is increasingly focusing on new, innovative and green solutions, which would minimize any harm to the environment.
Adaptive auger head
One of such ECO-friendly solutions is the adaptive auger head. Dredge Yard introduced the adaptive auger head system, which due to a strong suction vacuum, closely follows the ground when dredging. As a result, the adaptive auger head protects the marine animals from entering the suction system. It also causes minimal to no turbidity and accurately removes even the thinnest layers of sediment. Therefore, it is not only protective of the marine animals, but also of the general environment, especially when contaminated sediments are involved.
Additionally, our Auger dredger ECO 200 is equipped with the ECO-friendly system for environmental dredging. However, the adaptive auger head can also be purchased separately to upgrade existing dredgers. In this way, it can increase dredger efficiency, protect the environment and prolong your existing dredger life.
Spare parts
As an additional service, Dredge Yard offers dredge components from stock. We want to encourage maintenance, upgrading and modification of durable dredgers for a variety of applications. In this way, overproduction and rapid equipment disposal can be avoided.
Green(er) Future
Dredge Yard strives for a greener future, where dredging will not cause any negative impacts on the nature and its inhabitants. Therefore, we are constantly researching the newest technologies in order to design and engineer more efficient, greener dredging solutions.

This is the ninth installment in a series of articles on wellness. You can read the earlier articles at myamericannurse.com/category/wellness101/.
YOU DON’T HAVE TO GO FAR to experience nature—it can be in your own backyard, a community park, or walking trail. You also can venture miles from home for hiking, waterskiing, camping, or canoeing. When you’re outdoors, the rest of life seems to disappear. You become “one with nature”—spiritually, mentally, and physically—as you appreciate all the beauty this planet has to offer.
Your senses heighten as you become more aware of your surroundings. And you may not realize it, but you’re improving your health and well-being. Yes, outdoor activities, from a simple walk around the block to snow tubing down a wintry hill, enhance your overall health.
We may not give a lot of thought to how the environment fits into our wellness efforts, but the environment and how we take care of it can have a huge impact on our overall well-being.
The evidence is in
Research has demonstrated that green space, such as parks, forests, and river corridors, are good for our physical and mental health. In a study by Blumenthal and colleagues, 71% of people found a reduction in depression after going for a walk outdoors, versus a 45% reduction in those who took an indoor walk. In a 2013 study from Roe and colleagues, gardening demonstrated a significant reduction in subjects’ levels of the stress hormone cortisol. And in 2016, the World Health Organization conducted a systematic review of 60 studies from the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Europe and concluded that green space is associated with reduced obesity.
More than nature
“Environment” doesn’t mean only the great outdoors. Your environment is everything that surrounds you— your home, your car, your workplace, the food you eat, and the people you interact with. Nurses’ work environments contain many hazards, so we need to pay extra attention to this component of our wellness. The U.S. Department of Labor rates hospitals as one of the most dangerous places to work. In 2017, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that private-industry hospital workers face a higher incidence of injury and illness—six cases per 100 full-time workers—than employees working in other industries traditionally considered dangerous, such as manufacturing and construction. In 2015, the most common event leading to injuries in hospitals was overexertion and bodily reaction, including injuries from moving or lifting patients. In other words, those of us working with patients outside of a hospital setting are vulnerable, too.
Improve your workplace environment
The good news is that many injuries can be prevented with proper equipment and training. For in- stance, almost 50% of reported injuries and illnesses among nurses and other hospital workers were musculoskeletal, many (25% of all workers’ compensation claims for the healthcare industry in 2011) caused by overexertion from lifting, transferring, and repositioning patients. Learning safe ways to handle patients can safeguard your well-being as well as your patients’. It may be time to review your workplace safety standards or form a committee to review patient-handling procedures and other safety measures.
Of course, the people we deal with every day aren’t just risk factors for disease and injury. Everyone brings his or her personalities, attitudes, and behaviors, and we can’t always avoid the stress they add to our environment. We can, however, cushion ourselves against stress by modifying our own behavior.
Nurse.org offers these suggestions when dealing with a difficult patient:
- Avoid defensive thoughts. Remember, it’s not about you, it’s about the patient. Don’t blow up at him or her because you’re
- Set boundaries. If someone behaves inappropriately toward you by swearing or yelling, set limits by saying, “There are certain things we allow here, and this behavior is not one of them. I’ll step out of the room to give you time to calm”
- Let them tell their story. Letting a patient tell you how he or she got to this point can help reduce distress and might give you insight into the behavior. Even if you don’t agree with what the patient says, he or she will feel listened to, which may be calming.
- Realign your body language. Taking a few measured breaths to refocus your thoughts can help you calm down. Tension can create defensive body language that patients may react to negatively.
Choosing to thrive
Studies show that we thrive better when surrounded by people who support our goals and want to help us succeed. We can’t usually choose the people we work with, but we can consciously choose to spend more time with those friends and family members who support and uplift us.
And we can all contribute to making our physical surroundings healthier, from recycling to creating a culture of respect and gratitude. (See 6 ways you can improve your environment.) Start with a small step today—at work, at home, at school, with your family, or by volunteering in the community—to improve your environmental wellness.

Environment and climate change
Relevance of gender in the policy area
Environment is a cross-cutting issue. It encompasses issues relating to:
- water, air and soil quality
- waste management and the use of chemicals
- environmental assessment
- green public procurement, sustainable development and the urban environment
- the environmental impact of industry, land use
- the marine environment and the coast
- nature and biodiversity.
At EU level environment and climate change, although two separate issues, are increasingly associated and interlinked. Environmental change and climate change are increasingly caused by developments taking place at global level, including those relating to demographics, patterns of production and trade, and rapid technological progress. Such developments may offer significant opportunities for economic growth and societal well-being but nevertheless pose challenges and uncertainties for the EU’s economy and society, as well as causing environmental degradation worldwide. Coupled with current wasteful production and consumption systems in the world economy, rising global demand for goods and services and the depletion of resources are increasing the cost of essential raw materials, minerals and energy, generating more pollution and waste, increasing global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and making land degradation, deforestation and biodiversity loss worse.
In this context, the United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing (1995) identified environment as one of 12 critical areas for women. Area K of the Beijing Platform for Action (BPfA), on women and the environment, asserted that ‘women have an essential role to play in the development of sustainable and ecologically sound consumption and production patterns, and approaches to natural resource management’.
Gender is considered particularly relevant in climate protection policies, specifically in the design and implementation of adaptation and mitigation strategies as responses to climate change. When considering climate change from a gender equality perspective, various aspects should be taken into account. One consideration relates to the very low participation of women in decision-making in the sector. Secondly, to be effective climate policies should consider various gender-related aspects of climate change: the impact of climate change on women and men; their different contributions to and perceptions of climate change; and the solutions that women and men are perceived to prefer in terms of mitigation and adaptation. For example, measures intended to reduce reliance on fossil fuels and emissions from transport in the EU have led to increased demand for biofuels, a demand that can be met only by importing the latter from developing countries. This leads to land use changes, which are often gendered since the land used for biofuels production is most likely to be marginal land farmed by women for household subsistence rather than the prime agricultural land farmed by men for export .
Monitoring the gendered outcomes of climate change policy responses is thus important in pinpointing reforms to the climate protection system so that adaptation and mitigation responses promote gender equality, poverty eradication and sustainable development. As the European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE) notes:
Various research data show that gender differentials with regard to the impacts of climate change mean more casualties among women during extreme weather events and an increased burden from care work. There is also evidence of gender-specific consumption patterns that affect contributions to GHG emissions, and thus to climate change. For example, women spend more time at home due to care duties, and thus depend on domestic heating to a greater extent. For mobility, women depend on access to public transport to a larger degree due to lower levels of car ownership, but also because of their preferences for the use of environmentally-friendly solutions (public transport). Due to their lower average income, women are at greater risk of energy poverty than men, and have fewer options for investing in low-carbon options such as energy efficiency and renewable energies. Perceptions and attitudes towards climate change and climate policy options also vary substantially according to gender. Women are, on average, more concerned about climate change than men.

Gender inequalities in the policy area - Main issues
Women’s under-representation in environment and climate change decision-making institutions
Women are still under-represented in climate change decision-making bodies at the national level in EU Member States. In 2011, women held 18.2% of positions at the highest levels in ministries dealing with the environment/climate change, transport and energy policy. At managerial or administrative level, this figure was 27%, while among heads of sectoral departments or divisions it was 27.6% on average. However, the role of women in climate change-related ministries varies considerably across Member States, with Finland and Sweden achieving gender balance at the highest level, with women and men nearly equally represented within ministries, committees, agencies and institutions relevant to climate change. Recent data show that in 2014 women represent the 28% of senior ministers and 22% of junior ministers in the EU-28. At administration level, women represent the 30% of level 1 administrators and 38% of level 2 administrators.
In contrast to the situation at national level in relevant EU directorates-general (DG), in DG Climate Action and DG Energy women play an important role in high-level decision-making (40% of positions in each DG are held by women). However, in DG Environment and DG Mobility and Transport, this percentage is lower (25% and 12.5% respectively). In the committees of the EU responsible for climate change and related issues, women hold on average 39.2% of the positions (51.6% within the Committee on Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, 36.4% within the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, and 25% within the Committee on Transport and Tourism. In the directorates-general referring to environment and climate change (DG Climate Action, DG Energy, DG Environment and DG Mobility and Transport), as was the case in 2014, one in four commissioners is a woman (DG Mobility and Transport). While the commissioner of DG Environment is a man, as is the head of the cabinet, the members of the cabinet are equally represented by sex (50%). In terms of European Commission administrative positions (Director-General (Directorate-General), Directors (Directorates), women hold around 29% of posts at DG Environment, and 25% at DG Mobility and Transport and DG Climate Action, while 50% at DG Energy. At the European Parliament, 46% of the members of the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety Committee are women.
Within the Conference of Parties (COP) delegations to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the average proportion of women on the EU Member States’ delegations and the EU delegation over the period 2006 – 2010 was 37.6%, increasing from 24.3% in 1996, to 32.4% at COP6 in 2000, and 40.5% at COP16 in 2010. Recent figures show that women have reached the 45% of National COP delegation in the UNFCCC of the EU-28 Member States.
Globally, under the UNFCCC and the Kyoto Protocol, the proportions are less balanced: for example, on the executive board of the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) in June 2015, the percentage of women was only 10 (1 out of the 10 members). The proportion of women stood at 15% within the Least Developed Countries Expert Group, at 28% on the Adaptation Fund Board, and at 25% in the Technology Executive Committee. Of the party delegates to the 20th session of the COP and the eighth session of the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol (CMP), 36% were women.
Gender gaps in energy-related education are also relevant, in that the environment sector requires workers with scientific knowledge and domain-specific expertise in the sector. Women are strongly under-represented in this respect. According to an indicator developed by EIGE, in 2012 women accounted for 53.8% of the total number of graduates in the natural sciences, while in technological domains they accounted for only 28% of graduates. It must be emphasised, however, that not all areas included in the calculation of the indicator are directly linked with energy and/or climate change.
Gender differences in adaptation and mitigation strategies
Climate change is a complex environmental and social issue, affecting a world that is characterised by, and based on, deep-rooted unequal gender relations. This is not just a question of women’s vulnerability and the fact that they generally hold less power and are, therefore, less able to mitigate and cope with climate change. It’s also a question of understanding how women and men relate to one another and how these relationships influence the ways that households, communities, countries and the global community are affected by, and respond to, climate change.
Uncovering these power relations helps us understand why some groups are contributing differently to GHG emissions and why some are affected differently by climate change than others. It also enables us to analyse the ways in which climate change mitigation and adaptation may lead to different roles and responsibilities in the future. These need to be taken into account in order to identify solutions that draw on the skills, knowledge, resources and experiences of both sexes.
Adaptive activities (e.g. climate-proofing agriculture and ensuring food security, promoting the conservation and efficient use of water, pest and disease management, fire management) are critical to sustainable development. Adaptation efforts, which are daily issues for individual women and men, families and households, are likely to require more resources than such individuals currently have available. Though this impacts on both women and men and women- and men-headed households, it is likely to be more acute for women and women-headed households due to gender gaps in income and social and economic resources.
Women and men living in Europe contribute differently to GHG emissions, both in terms of total emissions and the sectors in which emissions are produced. These differences are based on prevailing gender roles and identities, which are expressed by behaviour and consumption patterns. These gender differentials in the consumption of services and goods can be partly explained by gendered socialisation and the social roles assigned to, and performed by, women and men. Studies have shown that women are more likely to have a greater awareness of health issues and more highly developed risk perceptions, which often impacts on how they perceive health and environmental issues, while men tend to be more strongly oriented towards convenience.
Mitigation strategies are also not gender or equity neutral. Mitigation within the context of sustainable development can help to promote gender equity and women’s empowerment by addressing at least four issues:
- women and men’s energy needs and uses
- women and men’s employment and entrepreneurship – though there are potential challenges and constraints in the agriculture, energy and power sectors
- incorporating women and men’s traditional knowledge and practices into mitigation strategies and policy frameworks
- paying close attention to ensuring gender equity in the use, conservation and management of forests.
Some mitigation actions, such as the provision of clean and modern energy services, save both women and men time, reduce accidents and promote better health. However, other mitigation actions, such as affecting land use, can shift the balance of economic and social resource distribution between women and men and among different communities, and can therefore exacerbate inequality.
Gender differences in the effects of climate change
Extreme weather conditions have gendered impacts. Many disaster studies from around the world show that drought and flooding often kill more women than men. Other differentiators such as age, socioeconomic status and ethnicity are also important determining factors in this context. The heat-wave in France in 2006 killed around 1% more elderly women than men due to cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease and directly heat-related deaths.
Both women and men are vulnerable to climate change, particularly if it reduces their capacity to adapt to its negative impacts and also adversely affects their ability to contribute to mitigation. However, women are frequently exposed to additional gender‐specific factors and barriers that consistently render them more vulnerable than men to the impacts of climate change and disasters. This prevents them from utilising their specific skills and knowledge (such as resource management and conservation) to improve mitigation and adaptation outcomes.
Existing gender-equality policy objectives at EU and international level
The gender dimension in environmental policies has begun to be addressed in policy initiatives and debates at the European and international levels only very recently. Gender equality and environmental sustainability have been mainstreamed into EU and international development policies in parallel processes.
EU level
European Council
The 2009 European Council Conclusions on Climate change and development underlined “the human dimension of climate change, including a gender perspective, and that poor people are most at risk, and that their resilience to climate change needs to be strengthened”. The document also refers to gender equality and women’s empowerment at the end of paragraph 6. This relates to support for programmes that contribute to a low-carbon and climate-resilient development path and adaptation to the adverse impacts of climate change: “In providing such support special attention should be paid to gender equality and women’s empowerment.”
The 2012 Council Conclusions on Gender Equality and the Environment stated that enhanced decision-making, qualifications and competitiveness in the field of climate change mitigation policy in the EU play an important role in the focus assigned to gender issues throughout EU environmental policies. These conclusions, which were informed by the report on gender and climate change commissioned by the Danish Presidency and produced by the European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE) recognise that: “Women play a vital role in sustainable development, and that gender as well as social and employment aspects need to be integrated into efforts to combat climate change in order to improve them” (paragraph 1). They also state that: “Women and men affect the climate differently: their consumption patterns are different and they have different CO2 footprints, and they are not represented equally in decision-making in this field … Studies show that women and men also have different perceptions and attitudes towards climate change: women are in general more concerned about this issue and more motivated to act. Women’s potential as agents of change needs to be recognised”. In addition, the conclusions stress that “There is an urgent need to improve gender equality in decision-making in the field of climate change mitigation, especially the transport and energy sectors, and to increase the number of women with relevant qualifications in scientific and technological fields as well as the number of women participating in relevant scientific bodies at the highest level” (paragraph 9). They claim that gender-based prejudices and stereotypes exclude women from areas of the green economy such as transport and energy, causing human resources to be wasted and preventing the EU from achieving its full competitive potential.
The Council calls on the Member States and the Commission to take active and specific measures aimed at achieving a balanced representation of women and men in decision-making in the field of climate change mitigation at all levels, including the EU level; to support women in science and technology at national and European level; to eliminate gender stereotypes and promote gender equality at all levels of education and training, as well as in working life; and to integrate the principle of gender mainstreaming into all relevant legislation, policy measures and instruments related to climate change mitigation. It calls on the Commission to provide guidance for gender mainstreaming of policy areas; to consider focusing on the issue of women and climate change in one of the future reports; and to take action, with the participation of civil society, to raise awareness of the gender dimension of climate change policy.
European Parliament
The European Parliament has been very active in this field since 2011, producing a number of resolutions which address climate change from a gender perspective. For example, in the European Parliament resolution of 29 September 2011 on developing a common EU position ahead of the UN Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20), Article 19 emphasises that the Rio+20 Summit should discuss an integrated approach to address multiple challenges such as poverty eradication, health, food, employment, gender equality, climate change and energy supply.
The European Parliament resolution of 20 April 2012 on women and climate change is explicitly concerned with exposing and addressing the links between climate change and gender. In Article 8 it calls on the Commission and the Member States to collect country-specific and gender-disaggregated data when planning, implementing and evaluating climate change policies, programmes and projects, so as to effectively assess and address the differing effects of climate change on each gender, to produce a guide on adapting to climate change, outlining policies that can protect women, and to empower women to cope with the effects of climate change.
Article 20 calls on the Commission and the Member States to integrate the gender issue into strategies for preventing and managing the risks associated with natural disasters, to promote women’s empowerment and awareness through capacity-building before, during and after climate-related disasters, and to further their active involvement in disaster anticipation, early warning systems and risk prevention as part of their role in resilience-building.
Article 35 stresses the important role played by women in implementing mitigation measures in daily life – for example, through energy- and water-saving practices, recycling measures and the use of eco-friendly and organic products.
Article 42 stresses the need for financing mechanisms to reflect women’s priorities and needs, and for the active involvement of organisations that promote gender equality in the development of funding criteria. This includes the allocation of resources for climate change initiatives, particularly at local level and in the activities of the Green Climate Fund.
The European Parliament report on women and climate change (2012) calls on “the Commission and the Council, in order to ensure that climate action does not increase gender inequalities but results in co-benefits to the situation of women, to mainstream and integrate gender in every step of climate policies, from conception to financing, implementation and evaluation … ”
Article 4 of the European Parliament resolution of 11 September 2012 on women and the green economy calls on the Commission and the Member States to compile age- and gender-disaggregated data when strategies, programmes and budgeting projects are being planned, implemented and evaluated for the environment and climate sectors.
Article 5 calls on the Commission and Member States to establish gender mainstreaming mechanisms at international, national and regional levels in environmental policies, as gender concerns and perspectives are not well integrated in policies and programmes for sustainable development.
The resolution also includes other recommendations regarding gender aspects of environment and the green economy in general, as well as particular recommendations relating to sustainable consumption, sustainable transport, the welfare sector, ‘green’ jobs, and sustainable policies in international relations.
Finally, the European Parliament, in its resolution of 9 June 2015 on the EU Strategy for Equality Between Women and Men Post 2015, calls on the Commission to gather gender-specific data with a view to conducting an impact assessment for women in the areas of climate, environment and energy policy. The resolution stresses the EU’s responsibility and role as a model for gender equality and women’s rights, and underlines that women are not only more vulnerable to the effects of energy supply and use, environment and climate change, but also effective actors in relation to mitigation and adaptation strategies, as well as a driving force for an equitable and sustainable model of growth.
European Commission
Like all EU policies, climate action is supposed to be gender mainstreamed, and DG CLIMA has named a gender focal person.
International level
United Nations
The United Nations play a pioneering role within the consideration of gender aspects in environmental policies. The World Summit on environment and development (Rio de Janeiro, 1992) adopted a gender perspective in all development and environment policies and programmes, leading to the promotion of women’s effective participation in the proper use of natural resources. This provided the first international precedent for including the gender perspective in promoting sustainable development.
As written in Principle 20 (Rio Principles) resulting from the UN conference on environment and development (UNCED) Rio, 1992: “Women have a vital role in environmental management and development. Their full participation is therefore essential in achieving sustainable development”.
During the Earth Summit held in Rio de Janeiro on 13 June 1992, 178 governments voted to adopt the Agenda 21 programme: it describes action priorities to achieve sustainable development until the 21st century. While there is mention of women throughout the 40 sectoral and inter-sectoral chapters, chapter 24 – Global action for women towards sustainable development – is specifically dedicated to considering women.
This chapter identifies areas that require urgent international action to achieve equality between women and men, which in turn is necessary to enable effective implementation of the sustainable development agenda. It focuses on the crucial role they play in changing the present consumption and production model and stresses that, if the Summit’s Resolutions are to be successfully implemented, they will need to play a part in politico-economic decisions. At the same time, there are proposed actions to end present discrimination against women. Agenda 21 recognises the importance of women’s traditional knowledge and practices, stresses the contributions women have made to biodiversity conservation (Section 24.8 (a)) and asks that specific measures be adopted to transform objectives into strategies (Section 24.2(f)).
The convention on biological diversity (CBD), adopted in 1992 at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (the Rio ‘Earth Summit’), is the international framework for the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity and the fair distribution of its benefits. The objective of the CBD is to promote the sustainable use of biodiversity. This convention recognises that biodiversity includes not only plants, animals, micro-organisms and their ecosystems, but also human beings and their needs (e.g. food, clean air, medicines and a clean and healthy environment). To date, it has been ratified by 190 states. Women’s participation has been explicitly addressed within the CBD. Paragraph 13 of the Preamble of the Convention mentions the important participation of women in the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity: “Recognise the vital role that women play in the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity, emphasising the need for the full participation of women at all levels of policymaking and implementation for biological diversity conservation.”
At the Fourth World Conference on Women, held in Beijing in 1995, the link between gender, the environment and sustainable development was clearly defined. Area K of the Platform for Action makes specific reference to the environment with strategic objectives and action as central themes, including the poverty that affects many women; the need for women to participate vigorously in making decisions about the environment at all levels; and integration of the gender perspective in sustainable development policies and programmes. This perspective was later apparent in a number of international meetings that further explored the relationship between gender and sustainable development. BPfA Area K on Women and Environment identifies the following strategic objectives:
Strategic objective K.1: Involve women actively in environmental decision-making at all levels
Strategic objective K.2: Integrate gender concerns and perspectives in policies and programmes for sustainable development
Strategic objective K.3: Strengthen or establish mechanisms at the national, regional and international levels to assess the impact of development and environmental policies on women.
The Earth Charter (2000), the international declaration of fundamental values and principles aimed at building a just, sustainable, and peaceful global society in the 21st century, “seeks to inspire in all peoples a sense of global interdependence and shared responsibility for the well-being of the human family, the greater community of life, and future generations”. In particular, Article 11 states: Affirm gender equality and equity as prerequisites to sustainable development and ensure universal access to education, health care and economic opportunity.
During the UN World conference on disaster reduction held in Hyogo (2005), the United Nations agreed on the opportunity to integrate gender equity into all decision-making and planning processes related to disaster risk management.
The Framework for Action of the World Conference on Disaster Reduction states: “A gender perspective should be integrated into all disaster risk management policies, plans and decision-making processes, including those related to risk assessment, early warning, information management, and education and training. Develop early warning systems that are people centred, in particular systems whose warnings are timely and understandable to those at risk, which take into account the demographic, gender, cultural and livelihood characteristics of the target audiences, including guidance on how to act upon warnings, and that support effective operations by disaster managers and other decision makers. Ensure equal access to appropriate training and educational opportunities for women and vulnerable constituencies, promote gender and cultural sensitivity training as integral components of education and training for disaster risk reduction”.
The Future We Want outcome document of the UN Conference on Sustainable Development/ Earth Summit (Rio+20) held in Rio de Janeiro 2012, recognises gender equality as an important cross-cutting issue, makes several gender-specific references in the preamble and in sectoral and thematic areas, and includes a special thematic section on gender equality and the empowerment of women, in which several provisions are made to enhance gender equality in the context of sustainable development and the promotion of a green economy. The document states that “women have a vital role to play in achieving sustainable development” and recognises “the leadership role of women”. In the document the United Nations “resolve to promote gender equality and the empowerment of women and to ensure their full and effective participation in sustainable development policies, programmes and decision-making at all levels”.
The Sendai Framework is the successor instrument to the Hyogo Framework for Action (HFA) 2005-2015: Building the Resilience of Nations and Communities to Disasters. It was adopted at the Third UN World Conference in Sendai, Japan, on 18 March 2015. It is the outcome of stakeholder consultations initiated in March 2012 and intergovernmental negotiations from July 2014 to March 2015, supported by the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction at the request of the UN General Assembly. Attention is posed on a participatory process which need to be tailored to the needs of users, including social and cultural requirements, in particular gender.
UNESCO
Since the fourth UNESCO Forum on Gender Equality held on 19 June 2008 with a deep focus on the gender dimensions of climate change, the commitment of UNESCO and its Division for Gender Equality to the mainstreaming of gender equality considerations throughout all of its actions to mitigate and/or adapt to global climate change, have clearly emerged. During the forum, UNESCO analysed the causes and foreseen effects of global climate change, highlighted the importance of integrating a gender equality dimension from the start into action to address climate change.

Below, you can find useful resources and practical examples for mainstreaming gender into environment and climate change policies. They are organised according to the most relevant phase of the policy cycle they may serve.
Practical examples of gender mainstreaming in environment and climate change
Austria
Integration of gender-related concerns and gender perspectives in sustainable development policies and programmes is realised through the Austrian Development Cooperation Agency (OEZA). In this context, the OEZA recognises the UN’s environmental conventions, the principles of EU policies and the OECD Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness in the inter-ministerial Strategic Guideline on Environment and Development (Strategischer Leitfaden Umwelt & Entwicklung) which was adopted by the Cabinet in September 2009. Women, as important guardians of environmental knowledge, are crucial actors when it comes to changes in natural resource management.
Furthermore, in December 2012 the Austrian Foreign Ministry organised the Vienna Policy Dialogue on Gender Equality in cooperation with UNDESA and UN Women. The event, Advancing gender equality and women’s empowerment in development cooperation and the post-2015 development agenda, was mainly aimed at preparing the fourth Development Cooperation Forum of the UN Economic and Social Council in 2014. The subjects discussed were, first and foremost, how gender equality and women’s empowerment can be positioned in the global environmental development agenda of the future.
Finland
As part of Finland’s presidency in the Nordic Council of Ministers in 2011, an electronic portal about climate change and gender was created. The Nordic gender equality ministers have been working to include a gender equality perspective into solutions targeted towards mitigation and adaptation work and to disseminate information on gender equality in climate change and sustainable development. The portal collects knowledge about climate and gender from a number of different perspectives including transport, consumption, food and energy. It also contains information about gender-aware climate work in the Nordic countries as well as the Faroe Islands, Greenland and Åland and also on global level (UN). Furthermore, it contains information about activities, reports and political decision-making regarding gender equality and climate change as well as portrays practical examples about how women and men, and girls and boys, are affected, and how they in turn affect climate change through their lifestyles and behaviour patterns.
Sweden
The Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences and Spatial Planning (Formas) is to pursue the impact of a gender perspective in research and promote equality between men and women. Formas annually reports on its work on, among other things, the distribution of women and men in its drafting groups and in applications received and approved applications.
Timeline
The key milestones of the EU environment and climate change policy are presented below.
The objectives of the European Environmental Policy are set in its Article 191.
Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), adopted in 1992 at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (the Rio ‘Earth Summit’), in which the important participation of women in the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity is explicitly mentioned.
Adoption of the Kyoto Protocol with the objective of reducing emissions of GHGs by 5% between 2008 and 2012 by taking more energetic (and legally binding) measures.
Adoption of the First European climate change programme (ECCP) which aims at identifying and developing all the necessary elements of an EU strategy to implement the Kyoto Protocol.
European Commission Directive 2003/87/EC that regulates the EU Emissions Trading System, the EU’s key instrument for reducing GHG emissions from industry.
The United Nations agreed on the opportunity to integrate gender equity into all decision-making and planning processes related to disaster risk management.
Adoption of the Climate and Energy Package that introduced an integrated approach to climate and energy policy with the aim of transforming Europe into a highly energy-efficient, low-carbon economy. The Climate and Energy Package set the mid-term targets, commonly known as the 20-20-20 targets.
It sets compulsory national targets for renewable energy which reflect Member States’ different starting points and potential for increasing renewables production as well as for emissions from sectors not covered by the EU Emissions Trading System.
Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, including objectives of environmental policy.
The European Parliament, in its Resolution of 9 June 2015 on the EU strategy for equality between women and men post 2015, calls on the Commission to gather gender-specific data with a view to conducting an impact assessment for women in the areas of climate, environment and energy policy.
Paris climate conference (COP21) which in December 2015, adopted the first-ever universal, legally binding global climate deal.
Current policy priorities at EU level
The overarching policy priorities of EU policy for environment and climate are clearly identified in the 7th Environment Action Programme (EAP) will be guiding European environment policy until 2020.
In particular, it identifies 3 key objectives:
- To protect, conserve and enhance the Union’s natural capital: in this field the EAP commits the EU and its Member States to speed up the implementation of existing strategies, fill gaps where legislation doesn't yet exist, and improve existing legislation.
- To turn the Union into a resource-efficient, green, and competitive low-carbon economy: the EAP sets out the conditions that will help transform the EU into a resource-efficient, low-carbon economy. There is a special focus on turning waste into a resource and to move towards more efficient use of our water resources. This requires:full delivery of the Climate and Energy Package to achieve the 20-20-20 targets and agreement on the next steps for climate policy beyond 2020significant improvements to the environmental performance of products over their life cyclereductions in the environmental impact of consumption, including issues such as cutting food waste and using biomass in a sustainable way.
- To safeguard the Union's citizens from environment-related pressures and risks to health and well-being: this third key action area covers challenges to human health and well-being, such as air and water pollution, excessive noise and chemicals. Europe needs to be sufficiently resilient to challenges posed by new and emerging risks, including the impacts of climate change. Thus it is necessary to:update air quality and noise legislationimprove implementation of legislation relating to drinking and bathing watertackle hazardous chemicals, including nanomaterials, chemicals that interfere with the endocrine system and chemicals in combination, as part of a broader, strategic approach for a non-toxic environment.
A set of 4 so-called ‘enablers’ will help Europe deliver on these goals:
- Better implementation of legislation, that would save €72 billion a year; increase the annual turnover of the EU waste management and recycling sector by €42 billion; and create over 400,000 new jobs by 2020.
- Better information by improving the knowledge base, in order to improve the way data and other information is collected, managed and used across the EU; invest in research to fill knowledge gaps; develop a more systematic approach to new and emerging risks.
- More and wiser investment for environment and climate policy, that can be effective only if impacts on the environment are properly accounted for and if market signals also reflect the true costs to the environment. This involves applying the polluter-pays principle more systematically; phasing out environmentally harmful subsidies; shifting taxation from labour towards pollution.
- Full integration of environmental requirements and considerations into other policies such as regional policy, agriculture, fisheries, energy and transport will ensure better decision-making and coherent policy approaches that deliver multiple benefits.
Two additional horizontal priority objectives complete the programme:
- To make the Union's cities more sustainable, promoting and expanding initiatives that support innovation and best practice sharing in cities; ensuring that by 2020, most cities in the EU are implementing policies for sustainable urban planning and design, and are using the EU funding available for this purpose.
- To help the Union address international environmental and climate challenges more effectively, many of the priority objectives in the EAP can only be achieved in cooperation with partner countries or as part of a global approach.

Junya Yagi's experiences:
I came to Poland with my family to join Prof. Piotr Sułkowski's group at the Faculty of Physics at the University of Warsaw. I was employed as a postdoctoral researcher for his project ""Quantum Fields and Knot Homologies"" funded by European Research Council, which aims to tackle fundamental questions that lie at the interface of quantum field theory, string theory and knot theory.
Jan Rozendaal's experiences:
After completing my PhD in the Netherlands, I came to Warsaw, Poland, for a postdoc position at the Institute of Mathematics of the Polish Academy of Sciences. Since I am a European citizen, securing a visa for myself was not a problem. However, my fiancée is from the United States and it was much more of a fuss to obtain a residence permit for her, mainly because we are not yet married. We were in the process of going through all the paperwork and trying to figure out how to proceed when someone recommended that we contact Monika Zaremba from EURAXESS Centre in Warsaw.
Danil Korelskiy's experiences:
I participated in an exchange studies program between Luleå University of Technology and Arkhangelsk State Technical University (in my hometown) and, therefore, came to Sweden as an exchange student.
Maria Pichou's experiences:
I am extremely satisfied from my experience with Euraxess. First, I found the grant on the Euraxess webpage and I applied afterwards. Second, the guide on Luxembourg I was provided with was very helpful. The people working for Euraxess Luxembourg have always been very close to the researchers. Euraxess Luxembourg is doing a fine job assisting people like me and they are always available for consultation to deal with any problems that may arise.
Sandro Lino Cardoso Pereira's experiences:
I was dealing with the difficulty of getting a suitable place to stay. We had exhausted all the possibilities we have been informed of. We have contacted different people and institutions we believed could be of some help to us, but we were unsuccessful. Then I got to know about the existence of the Euraxess-Luxembourg. Euraxess - Luxembourg (and particularly Ms Bárbara Daniel) were of extreme importance during my moving to Luxembourg. When I got in direct contact with Ms Bárbara Daniel, she immediately solved our problem. have always found the time to receive us and to actively try to help us. It is always more comfortable to undertake this kind of ventures when you feel that there are people at your side. . The European Commission has the power to determine, on the basis of article 45 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 whether a country outside the EU offers an adequate level of data protection.
The adoption of an adequacy decision involves
- a proposal from the European Commission
- an opinion of the European Data Protection Board
- an approval from representatives of EU countries
- the adoption of the decision by the European Commission
At any time, the European Parliament and the Council may request the European Commission to maintain, amend or withdraw the adequacy decision on the grounds that its act exceeds the implementing powers provided for in the regulation.
The effect of such a decision is that personal data can flow from the EU (and Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland) to that third country without any further safeguard being necessary. In others words, transfers to the country in question will be assimilated to intra-EU transmissions of data.
The European Commission has so far recognised Andorra, Argentina, Canada (commercial organisations), Faroe Islands, Guernsey, Israel, Isle of Man, Japan, Jersey, New Zealand, Switzerland and Uruguay as providing adequate protection.
On 30 March 2021, adequacy talks were concluded with South Korea. The European Commission will now proceed with launching the decision-making procedure to adopt the adequacy decision.
These adequacy decisions do not cover data exchanges in the law enforcement sector which are governed by the Law Enforcement Directive (Article 36 of Directive (EU) 2016/680).
On 19 February 2021, the Commission launched the procedure for the adoption of two adequacy decisions for transfers of personal data to the United Kingdom, under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Law Enforcement Directive (LED) respectively. . Latest
Upcycling innovation to extract value from biowaste
Too much waste ends up in landfill, removing potentially reusable resources from the economy. To address this, the EU-funded VOLATILE project has developed a process for transforming biological waste which can then be used in a range of industries. This could deliver products with real added value for EU citizens, such as biofuel and bioplastics, as well as soap and Omega-3 oils.
Planting the seeds of a sustainable organic farming future
Farmers need access to suitable organic seed but there is a lack of high-quality organic seeds in Europe. The EU-funded LIVESEED project addressed this by developing a new organic seed quality strategy, a Europe-wide seed database and sustainable breeding techniques that target specific farming conditions. By strengthening the EU’s organic agriculture, these results will benefit all citizens.

Why New Business Models Matter for Green Growth
New business models can make an important contribution to the transition to green growth. While some new business models involve large firms, others are small start-up firms that seek to exploit technological or commercial opportunities that have been neglected or not yet explored by more established firms. New firms tend to engage in more radical innovation than existing firms, and scaling up new business models can therefore help reduce environmental pollution, optimise the use of natural resources, increase productivity and energy efficiency, and provide a new source of economic growth. Although the market for green goods and services is growing, the development of new business models is affected by a range of barriers, many of which can be addressed by well-designed policies.

perc,https://www.perc.org/1998/05/01/the-common-law-how-it-protects-the-environment/ ,"Introduction
Unless you are well into middle age or were a precocious student, you probably have little memory of the United States without the Environmental Protection Agency and the host of federal statutes it implements. Most Americans presume that the environment is something the government must control to protect. Without government control, they think, we would return to the frightening days of burning rivers, dying lakes, people fleeing their homes at Love Canal, and thick smog filling the air that little children breathe.
Politicians have fostered this notion, and academics of many stripes have supported it. But they are ignoring, in some cases deliberately, a long history of environmental controls through common-law protections. Common law is the term we use for the legal rules and traditions that have been developed over time through court decisions.
The purpose of this PERC Policy Series paper is to show, by examining specific cases in American and English history, that strong legal traditions enabled ordinary citizens to protect their air, land, and water, often against politically potent parties. Even public law officials, such as attorneys general, used the common law to protect citizens against environmental dangers. Unfortunately, as we will see, statutory regulation has largely supplanted the common-law legal regime that once provided solutions for many environmental problems.
The Law of the Land
Students are taught that the Constitution was the document that founded the nation and that it is “the supreme law of the land.” In fact, however, the founders viewed the common law–the rules and traditions embodied in court decisions–as the law of the land (Sherry 1987). As Harvard law professor Harold Berman (1961, 12) notes, an important part of the founding of the Republic “was the reception of the English common law . . . together with certain English statutes.” Common law reflected the view that free people must take responsibility for their actions and must be held responsible for their actions, with the courts providing an important avenue for holding them accountable. Many state constitutions expressly adopted the English common law.
Today, in contrast, law is mostly regulatory management. Citizens and their lawyers negotiate, arbitrate, and litigate with the many arms of the pervasive regulatory state. This arrangement is fundamentally different from the founders’ understanding of the relationship between people and their government.
Most of the chipping away of the traditional common-law regime has been done in the guise of the environmental “crisis.” No doubt there would have been stronger opposition had not the “crisis” excuse been so strong.
To begin to untangle the regulatory web that has overwhelmed the common law, we will look at how the common law worked to allow people to protect themselves against pollution, whether of water, air, or land. To do this, we will summarize cases that reflect the state of the law in the supposed dark days before the advent of environmental activism. Then we will consider what problems there were with the common law and why it was so broadly supplanted by statutory regulation.
Protecting the Environment
Long ago, before the terminology of environmental degradation evolved and the regulatory machinery began to determine what constitutes illegal pollution, people knew that they and their property could suffer from noxious pollutants. Such pollution was offensive; sometimes it injured people’s health; and sometimes it damaged property values. The protection against this invasion came primarily through legal actions for trespass and nuisance. Those who allowed something noxious to escape their control and invade the property of others could be held accountable for their actions through private litigation. (In many cases, either trespass or nuisance could apply, since both actions were often involved when pollution reached others’ property.) While evidence of harm had to be shown for damages to be assessed, the basic notions are commonsensical.
Nuisance actions may be private or public. A private nuisance is a substantial and unreasonable interference with the use and enjoyment of an interest in property. Such interference may be intentional or may be due to carelessness. As Supreme Court Justice George Sutherland said in a case in 1926, “Nuisance may be merely a right thing in a wrong place like a pig in the parlor instead of the barnyard.”(1) Legal actions can lead to recovery for damages to land as well as to recovery for damages to health or any other benefit attached to our interests in property.
A public nuisance is an act that causes inconvenience or damage to public health or order or that obstructs public rights. If a business creates noxious emissions that affect many citizens, a public attorney may bring an action on behalf of all affected citizens to have the activity terminated.
Trespass created rights similar to those against nuisance. If a harmful substance is allowed, intentionally or carelessly, to invade the property of another, whether by land, air, or water, there may be a trespass. If so, the defendant is held responsible for damages.
Since water is often not owned by property owners whose land abuts a lake or a stream, the common law extends protection to water quality through riparian rights. Riparian rights to water are user rights that allow water users to sue those who damage water quality to the point where its use and enjoyment are reduced.
On the following pages, we will show how the principles of nuisance and trespass protected people against pollution in the past. We will look at protection of surface water through riparian rights, protection of underground water and land, and protection against air pollution. We will see the strengths of the common-law protections as well as their limitations.
Surface Water
In the late nineteenth century, the Carmichael family owned a 45-acre farm in Texas, with a stream running through it, that bordered on the state of Arkansas. In the 1890s the city of Texarkana, Arkansas, built a sewage system and connected numerous residences and businesses to it. The sewage collected by the city system was deposited “immediately opposite plaintiffs’ homestead, about eight feet from the state line, on the Arkansas side.”(2) The Carmichaels sued the city in federal court in Arkansas
The Carmichaels were forced to connect their property to a public water system to obtain water for their family and livestock. The cost of the water hook-up and its use was $700. In addition, they claimed that the value of their property was reduced by $5,000; the enjoyment of their homestead over the previous two years was reduced by $2,000; and the dread of disease was valued at $2,000.
The court found that the
cesspool is a great nuisance because it fouls, pollutes, corrupts, contaminates, and poisons the water of [the creek], depositing the foul and offensive matter . . . in the bed of said creek on plaintiffs’ land and homestead continuously. . . . [thereby] depriving them of the use and benefit of said creek running through their land and premises in a pure and natural state as it was before the creation of said cesspool. . . .(3)
The claims for damages were awarded.The Carmichaels also sought a permanent injunction against the cesspool. Judge Rogers found that the city of Texarkana was operating properly under state law to build a sewer system, but that there was no excuse for fouling the water used by the Carmichaels, regardless of how many city residences benefited from the sewer system.
Citing other cases, the court found that the action at law for damages was proper, as was the request for an injunction. The court cited a leading text on the law of torts:
If a riparian proprietor has a right to enjoy a river so far unpolluted that fish can live in it and cattle drink of it and the town council of a neighboring borough, professing to act under statutory powers, pour their house drainage and the filth from water-closets into the river in such quantities that the water becomes corrupt and stinks, and fish will no longer live in it, nor cattle drink it, the court will grant an injunction to prevent the continued defilement of the stream, and to relieve the riparian proprietor from the necessity of bringing a series of actions for the daily annoyance. In deciding the right of a single proprietor to an injunction, the court cannot take into consideration the circumstance that a vast population will suffer by reason of its interference.(4)
Judge Rogers noted: “I have failed to find a single well-considered case where the American courts have not granted relief under circumstances such as are alleged in this bill against the city. . . .”(5)
A 1913 New York high court case illustrates how riparian rights could protect the water-quality rights of one citizen even against large business interests.(6) A new pulp mill polluted a creek. A downstream farmer, Whalen, sued the mill for making the water that passed by his land unfit for agricultural use. He had to obtain an alternative water source for his crops and animals. The trial court awarded damages of $312 and granted an injunction, ordering the mill to end harmful pollution within one year or close operations.
But the appellate division overturned the injunction and reduced the damages to $100. The court noted that the mill was an important economic asset to the area. It cost over $1 million to build and employed about five hundred people. Thus, it was worth far more than the water was to the plaintiff. However, the Court of Appeals (New York’s highest court) unanimously reinstated the decision of the trial court:
Although the damage to the plaintiff may be slight as compared with the defendant’s expense of abating the condition, that is not a good reason for refusing an injunction. Neither courts of equity nor law can be guided by such a rule, for if followed to its logical conclusion it would deprive the poor litigant of his little property by giving it to those already rich.(7) (italics added)
The Court cited numerous opinions from other states that were in agreement, including a 1900 Indiana holding involving a similar situation:
The fact that the appellant has expended a large sum of money in the construction of its plant, and that it conducts its business in a careful manner and without malice, can make no difference in its rights to the stream. Before locating the plant the owners were bound to know that every riparian proprietor is entitled to have the waters of the stream that washes his land come to it without obstruction, diversion, or corruption, subject only to the reasonable use of the water, by those similarly entitled, for such domestic purposes as are inseparable for and necessary for the free use of their land; they were bound also to know the character of their proposed business, and to take themselves at their own peril whether they should be able to conduct their business upon a stream . . . without injury to their neighbors; and the magnitude of their investment and their freedom from malice furnish no reason why they should escape the consequences of their own folly.(8)
Even when a government gave an industry preferential water rights, the common law would not allow the preference to expand to include a right to pollute, as a turn-of-the-century case makes clear. The Idaho constitution stated that mining operations “shall have preference over those using the same [water] for manufacturing or agricultural purposes.”(9) A farmer downstream from a mining operation sued for damage to his farm caused by acids dumped in the Coeur d’Alene River, which was used by the farm. The federal appeals court held that even if the mining operation was in “the ordinary and usual mode of mining” and even if it had a constitutional preference for access to water, it had no “right to dump injurious and deleterious materials into a stream.”(10) The court noted that, with the exception of one case from Pennsylvania, this view represents “an unbroken line of decisions in the United States and England.”(11)
A more recent case, decided during the 1950s, dealt with an International Paper Company plant that had been located on a Louisiana bayou since the 1930s. Recognizing the rights of downstream landowners, the mill had paid forty landowners for the right to discharge effluent into the stream, at a cost of several hundred thousand dollars.
Plaintiff Maddox operated a fishing camp on the bayou twenty miles downstream from the mill and had not sold water-quality rights to the mill. He claimed his livelihood was threatened by the water pollution and sued for damages or, failing that, for an injunction. Expert witnesses testified that the mill had installed high quality water-pollution control devices, that its ability to improve the devices had been hampered by World War II, and that the mill’s effluent still caused damages. The court awarded Maddox $8,000 in damages for the lost value of his business and reduction in property values.(12) The appeals court upheld the lower court’s decision.(13)
So, long before the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) came into existence, firms knew that if they substantially polluted their neighbors’ water, they could expect to be found liable. To minimize liability, water polluters installed pollution control devices. Paper mills in Wisconsin routinely owned miles of downstream river property, knowing that otherwise they would be liable for violation of riparian rights (Davis 1971, 777-80).
While such water pollution cases showed up consistently over the years, they did not represent massive numbers of cases. For example, a 1971 survey of all reported American common-law cases involving violation of riparian rights (water pollution) found a total of 445 cases, including cases dating back to the nineteenth century (Davis 1971, 742). From 1945 to 1970, there were never more than four common-law water and air pollution case decisions reported in any given year, most of them involving water pollution.(14) The reason, we believe, is that the law was generally understood and therefore only infrequently contested.
Common-law protection of water does not apply just to those who own property that abuts a waterway but to all who have the right to use the water, for purposes including recreation. Those who enjoy sport fishing in England have long protected water quality through private litigation brought by angling associations. For example, in Pride of Derby and Derbyshire Angling v. British Celanese Ltd. and Others,(15) a fishing club, Pride of Derby, and its association, the Derbyshire Angling Association, brought legal action against the borough of Derby, British Celanese, Ltd., and the British Electricity Authority. The defendants discharged sewage, industrial waste, and heated effluent which polluted and raised the temperature of the River Derby, damaging the anglers’ fishing. The suit by the fishing clubs was joined by the Earl of Harrington, who owned land along the river.
The lower court issued an injunction restraining the three defendants from reducing the quality of the river’s water, but suspended the injunction for two years to give the defendants time to alter their operations. The defendants appealed the injunction but the Chancery Court upheld it. The borough of Derby argued that Parliament had given it statutory authority to pollute when it authorized the borough to build a sewage treatment works. The Court rejected this argument and noted that the statute did not authorize pollution.
The borough also asked the Court to substitute damages for an injunction, since the community could not easily rebuild its sewage treatment plant. But the court rejected this position, noting that damages would be an inadequate remedy for the angling club, whose members want to exercise their right to fish. The injunction required the borough to redesign its sewage system, Celanese to change its discharge practices, and the British Electricity Authority to reduce its discharge of superheated water. This British case illustrates the effectiveness of common law in protecting property rights, in this case the right to fish, and shows how this protection translates to environmental protection. Because the right to fish is a privately owned right in Great Britain, individuals can protect streams effectively through court suits.
The last major federal water pollution case in the United States was decided shortly before passage of the Clean Water Act of 1972.(16) The state of Illinois sued the city of Milwaukee for sewage pollution of Lake Michigan, which was the source of Chicago’s drinking water. The Supreme Court held that the federal district court could issue an injunction against Milwaukee. The Court noted that common law, which looks to states for guidance, can be invoked to abate a public nuisance in interstate waters. “While federal law governs, consideration of state standards may be relevant. Thus, a State with high water quality standards may well ask that its strict standards be honored and that it not be compelled to lower itself to the more degrading standards of a neighbor.”(17)
This ruling became moot some months later, after the Clean Water Act was passed by Congress. Milwaukee returned, asking the Court to vacate its order, and it won. The Supreme Court held that “the establishment of such a self-consciously comprehensive program by Congress, which certainly did not exist when Illinois v. Milwaukee was decided, strongly suggests that there is no room for courts to attempt to improve on that program with federal common law.”(18)
The Supreme Court’s judgment that the act displaced federal common law with respect to interstate pollution was reaffirmed in a 1992 case. Oklahoma sued Arkansas for allowing polluted water to flow into Oklahoma. Although the water met EPA and Arkansas standards, it failed to meet the standards of the state of Oklahoma. The Court rejected Oklahoma’s claim, noting that Congress had granted the EPA broad jurisdiction over water quality.(19)
Thus, today, the fact that a state asserts that its water quality standard is being violated is legally irrelevant if the EPA says that federal water quality standards are being met. As a result, the states are little more than EPA’s agents in water quality issues. Federal water-quality regulations dominate. The regulations do not abolish common-law remedies, as we will see later, but they largely supplant them.
Land and Underground Water
The primary problem caused by pollution of land is groundwater pollution due to seepage from improperly disposed wastes. Wastes that are properly contained rarely cause harm. After the famous Love Canal incident in the late 1970s, Congress passed the Superfund law in 1980 (the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act) to regulate the cleanup of toxic waste sites. Despite this law, some common-law cases have occurred, and they show how the common law might have dealt with the problem of groundwater pollution over time.
For example, in 1981, the Illinois EPA, backed by the federal EPA, supported the right of a chemical waste landfill to remain in operation. The landfill had been built with state and federal approval, but residents of a nearby village alleged that the landfill was damaging their water supply. The Illinois supreme court found that the landfill was causing groundwater contamination and that there could be a chemical explosion given the disposal technique used.(20) It held that the landfill was a public and a private nuisance. The village residents were there first; their right not to have their property damaged could not be stripped in favor of a “general societal” desire for a landfill. The court noted that toxic landfills are legitimate, but they must be constructed so as not to impose costs on surrounding landowners who have not agreed to the intrusion. The court issued a permanent injunction against the landfill and ordered that the toxic wastes be dug up, moved, and the land restored.
The courts’ view of the standards for groundwater contamination has evolved over the decades, as the 1982 case of Wood v. Picillo(21) illustrates. Neighboring property owners sued a farmer who maintained a hazardous waste dump on his property. They claimed that the dump emitted noxious fumes and polluted groundwater. The Rhode Island supreme court agreed. In doing so it overturned a 1934 decision that would have supported the defendant’s position. The 1934 decision was based on the state of science at that time, when knowledge about the course of groundwater was, as the court stated in 1982, “indefinite and obscure.” Since 1934, the court said:
the science of groundwater hydrology as well as societal concern for environmental protection has developed dramatically. As a matter of scientific fact the courses of subterranean waters are no longer obscure and mysterious. . . . We now hold that negligence is not a necessary element of a nuisance case involving contamination of public or private waters by pollutants percolating through the soil and traveling underground routes.(22)
In other words, the common law now imposes strict liability (that is, liability even when there is no negligence) on polluters who cause damage to waters. This standard of care is consistent with old common-law tort rules imposing strict liability in case of hazardous materials, rules recorded in a famous 1868 British case, Rylands v. Fletcher.(23) This case is often cited for restating the ancient proposition, “So use your property as not to injure your neighbor’s property.” Strict liability is imposed if there is evidence of injury or of potential to cause injury in cases of hazardous substances.
Thus, advances in knowledge of the effects of toxic substances, and the ability to track them, means tougher standards today than in years past. As a New York court noted in 1983, “One who creates a nuisance through an inherently dangerous activity or use of an unreasonably dangerous product is absolutely liable for resulting damages, regardless of fault, and despite adhering to the highest standard of care.”(24)
In 1994, the supreme court of Florida, in a common-law case, held that a firm that damaged an underground water supply by negligent disposal of toxic wastes was responsible for the cost of restoring the groundwater to make it fit for human consumption.(25) The company argued that it should only be responsible for the change in the value of the land that covered the groundwater. The court rejected this damage measure, holding the firm responsible for the $3 million spent for alternative water supplies and $5.6 million for the estimated cost of restoration of groundwater quality.
Finally, another recent case involves the granddaddy of all Superfund sites, Love Canal. Readers may recall horror stories of seeping chemical waste from an abandoned toxic dump site run by Hooker Chemical Company. Publicity about this site helped spur public support for passage of the Superfund law, one of the last acts of the Carter administration. This case ultimately involved common-law and regulatory action against Hooker Chemical Company, even though the land involved had been sold to the Niagara school board with warnings about the site contents more than twenty-five years before Love Canal became America’s best known waste dump.
Love Canal was a failed entrepreneurial canal built in the 1800s. In 1941, Hooker Chemical bought the 3,000-feet-long trough, which was 8 to 16 feet deep and 60 to 80 feet wide, to use to dump toxic waste from its plant on the outskirts of the city of Niagara Falls, New York. The soil around the canal was a hard clay, so it made an excellent disposal site that never caused significant water contamination.
As the city of Niagara grew, the local school board became interested in land that included Hooker’s hazardous waste site. Seeking to build a grammar school, the school board sought to buy the land. Spelling out the risks involved, Hooker initially refused to sell the land. After the school board indicated it would condemn the land and force a sale, Hooker sold the land for one dollar and informed the Niagara school board about the hazardous waste contained in the canal. The firm’s efforts to include restrictive covenants in the deed of transfer were frustrated by the school board. Later, over company objections, the board built a public school on contaminated land and sold additional parcels for residential development, without providing any warnings. Problems later arose that received national attention. Hooker had to pay for a cleanup of the site under the Superfund law.
Hooker was later sued by the United States and the state of New York in tort (that is, under common law).(26) The government sought punitive damages from Hooker. The court rejected this request, although it did find Hooker negligent, primarily for not coming forward with more information about the dangers of various chemicals in later years.
While the Company should have made greater efforts to keep local residents off the property, it violated . . . no legal obligation in failing to do so. It responded to complaints about odors, fires, and exposures to chemicals whenever notified, and there was no evidence of injury during the disposal operations that would have signaled a compelling need to provide more protection.(27)
Despite the notoriety associated with Love Canal, the court noted that its review of injuries from chemical exposure show only “relatively minor noticeable injury.”(28) That is, the Love Canal Superfund site, which is the stuff of great environmental legends, was associated with very little harm to humans, none of which would have ever occurred had the school board not forced the transfer of the land and then failed to provide information to subsequent developers.
Air
In comparison with surface and groundwater pollution cases, few common-law air pollution cases are found. One reason is that most air pollution comes from multiple sources, making it difficult to identify defendants. But it is clear that the courts have long recognized common-law liability for air pollution when liability can be assigned to a polluter causing harm.
An early case illustrating common-law protection against air pollution was Georgia v. Tennessee Copper Co.(29) The state of Georgia, on behalf of its citizens, sued two companies that operated copper smelters in Tennessee near the Georgia border. Justice Holmes noted that a public nuisance had been created because the “sulphurous fumes cause and threaten damage on so considerable a scale to the forests and vegetable life, if not to health, within [several counties in Georgia]. . . .”(30) Defendants argued that they had recently constructed new facilities that reduced the scope of the problem, but the Supreme Court held for Georgia. The Court gave the companies a reasonable time to build more emission-control equipment, but held that if such equipment did not reduce emissions enough to protect plant life in Georgia, the state could ask the court for an injunction to shut down the smelters.
In 1915 the parties returned to the Supreme Court.(31) The companies showed that their new, expensive equipment cut emissions by more than half. Georgia argued that this was not enough and demanded that the smelters be closed. The chief justice appointed a scientist from Vanderbilt University to spend six months, at company expense, studying the emissions and the likely effect of new controls. In the meantime, the Court ordered the companies to cut back production to reduce emissions further. Based on the evidence presented by the scientist, the companies would either be allowed to continue operation with more emission-control equipment in place, or, if that could not reduce emissions sufficiently, would have to shut down. Finally, after following the guidance of the Vanderbilt professor, the firm satisfied the plaintiffs, and the Court ended its oversight of the case.
A similar strong support of the right to clean air was found in a case before the Arizona supreme court in 1931.(32) A heavy-metal smelter nine miles from the plaintiff’s farm caused $1,300 worth of damage to his crops in 1926. In 1927, because the smoke continued to deposit harmful levels of chemicals on the farm, the plaintiff did not plant a crop but sued for the value that would have been created had the smoke not continued. The high court upheld the verdict for the farmer, holding that he could recover the profits that he could have earned from planting. The fact that the pollution resulted
from the carrying on of a perfectly lawful business in the most approved way made no difference. The landowners were deprived of their legal right to farm unmolested by the poisonous fumes none the less by the fact that the discharge thereof was a necessary incident to a business of this character.(33)
A more modern air pollution case is R. L. Renken v. Harvey Aluminum.(34) An aluminum plant in The Dalles, Oregon, employed 550 people, making it the largest employer in town. It was sued by several orchard owners who claimed that their crops had been damaged by fluoride emissions. Finding the pollution to be a trespass and a nuisance, the court awarded the orchard owners approximately $10,000 each in damages for the crop losses and ordered the plant to install state-of-the-art emission-control equipment, which was estimated to cost over $2 million. If the equipment was not in place within a year, the plant could be ordered closed.
The parties ended up in court again several years later over a dispute about a settlement they had agreed to after the previous case.(35) The court enforced the agreement, requiring the company to compensate the orchard owners more than $940,000 “for past or future economic losses in their respective orchards.”(36) The same factory, under new owners, ended up in litigation later, Orchard View Farms v. Martin Marietta Aluminum.(37) The court awarded $103,000 in compensatory damages and $200,000 in punitive damages to nearby agricultural landowners. Clearly, the orchard owners had a right to air that was not polluted in a way that harmed their cultivation.
A recent case, Bradley v. American Smelting and Refining Co,(38) though more complicated, affirms the right of the ordinary person not to be harmed by air pollution. The Bradleys lived on Vashon Island, Washington, four miles from a copper refinery run by American Smelting (ASARCO). The Bradleys sued ASARCO in federal court in Washington for damages in trespass and nuisance caused by the deposit of airborne particles of heavy metals from ASARCO’s smelter. The smelter had operated since 1905. It was regulated by state and federal air pollution laws and was in compliance with all regulations. The gases that passed over and landed on the Bradleys’ land could not be seen or smelled by humans; they required microscopic detection.
The federal court, which would use Washington common law to determine the case, was uncertain as to what that law was, since there were few precedent cases. The court asked the Washington supreme court to instruct it on the status of the Washington common law of nuisance and trespass as it applied to air pollution.
The Washington supreme court held that ASARCO had the requisite intent to commit intentional trespass. Even though no harm was intended, and ASARCO was not aware of the Bradleys, the company knew particles were being emitted from its facilities. Secondly, the court held that “an intentional deposit of microscopic particulates, undetectable by the human senses, gives rise to a cause of action for trespass as well as a claim of nuisance.”(39) Hence, the ASARCO emissions created a nuisance and a trespass. But the court noted that for a cause of action for nuisance or trespass to be successful, there must be “proof of actual and substantial damages.”(40)
Upon return to federal court, that court applied the law as explained by the Washington supreme court. While the elements of a cause of action for trespass and nuisance existed, the case was dismissed because there was no evidence of damage or harm to plaintiffs or their property from the air pollution.(41) This case, once again, illustrates the common law at work. Under common law, even difficult-to-detect emissions can be causes of harm but at the same time plaintiffs must prove damages.
In spite of this history, it is true that air pollution is difficult to solve through common law. Air pollution has been a problem for centuries. Smoke from coal was long a bane of population centers. Cities and states began to pass ordinances and statutes to deal with their smoke problems over a century ago (Stern 1982). In other words, local communities responded to the limitations of the common law in dealing with pollution, first by regulating the quality of coal-fired boilers and setting restrictions on locomotives. As coal use declined, automobiles gradually became the larger problem. California took the lead in investigating how to deal with auto emissions. Other states, including New York and Texas, also imposed ambient air-quality standards before the federal standards emerged.
As a result of these forces–common law augmented by local regulations–air quality improved steadily during the 1950s and 1960s before the passage of the Clean Air Act of 1970. Indeed, the rate of improvement in air quality slowed after the EPA became the air quality czar (Goklany 1995, 351-2). It may be that the common law alone could not have solved all air pollution problems, but there seems little doubt that common law, combined with state and local controls, would have taken major strides in controlling air and water pollution.(42) However, it was largely supplanted by politically engineered federal controls.
Since passage of the Clean Air Act of 1970, the Environmental Protection Agency has been the primary controller of air quality in the United States. The agency, and various state pollution agencies operating under EPA supervision, issue pollution permits to major pollution sources and determine pollution limits on vehicles and other emission sources. There have been few common-law air pollution cases since 1970.
Limitations of the Common Law
The cases reported here represent the majority view, but there was a minority view, also. Some courts would rule for polluters, holding that the economic benefit of a factory that employed many people outweighed the damage to a few property holders. Some courts held that pollution was just a fact of modern life and necessary for progress to occur. The courts were not always consistent in their decisions.
Legal action is always costly. Even the wealthy do not sue everyone who violates their rights. Low-income people may find some litigation beyond their reach, but the existence of contingency fees enables even the poor to bring suits when their cases are good ones. And, as we saw in the case of farmer Whalen and the pulp factory, the common law does not “deprive the poor litigant of his little property by giving it to those already rich.” There is no such principle in the legislative process, which is dominated by special interests.
Multiple polluters that each inflict low levels of damage are unlikely to be held liable–especially when the damage is shared by many. For that reason, problems with air pollution caused by automobiles cannot be handled effectively through common-law courts.
Injuries and harms that come after long gestation periods present another challenge. Parties who can show evidence of injury or imminent harm may have a common-law cause of action. However, efforts to obtain injunctions for speculative harms are not generally successful. Regulation may be the only answer to limit actions that may cause future harms such as cancer. But we cannot know how the law might have evolved had it not been pushed to one side by regulation. It is not difficult to imagine environmental courts–ordinary courts assisted by special masters trained in environmental science–and other arrangements evolving to satisfy the needs of people concerned about their environmental rights.
The Statute Law Substitute
The common-law concept of property rights, with its requirements for proof of damages and its associated rights and duties, formed the foundation for environmental protection in the United States for many decades. This concept was changed fundamentally by the flurry of federal environmental statutes passed in the late 1960s and 1970s. The new statutes give standing to all citizens, whether they are harmed or not. In contrast, common law requires well-identified plaintiffs and evidence of damages to obtain standing to sue. Under statutes, evidence of a technical violation of a statute-based regulation, rather than evidence of harm or the threat of harm, can spur legal action. Some federal statutes also provide funding for groups who can monitor and then sue polluters who fail to meet any one of a host of technical rules.
Unlike common-law remedies, which provide payment for damages to those who are harmed or enjoin polluters to stop their harmful actions, statute law calls for penalties and fines to be paid to the U.S. Treasury or to “public interest” organizations that seek to raise awareness about the environment. Put simply, the statutes provide subsidies to encourage environmental suits that may be totally unrelated to actual environmental harm.
A 1997 South Carolina suit and decision illustrate the dramatic differences between common law and statute-based environmentalism. Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Environmental Services (TOC), Inc. involved a firm that operated an incinerator.(43) The incinerator’s air pollution control system discharged an effluent containing mercury into a river.
Laidlaw had purchased the incinerator from an owner who held a state-issued, EPA-approved, water pollution control permit. The former owner’s permit for the plant set maximum allowable daily discharges of listed pollutants–including mercury at a maximum of 20 parts per billion (ppb).
Regulations required the new owner to obtain a new permit. When Laidlaw’s permit was issued by the South Carolina agency authorized by the EPA to control water pollution, the maximum daily load for mercury was reduced from 20 ppb to 1.3 ppb. But at the time, technology could reduce mercury only down to a range of 2 ppb to 5 ppb. Laidlaw did not contest the permit on these grounds but began a research program with state regulators in an attempt to meet the new standard. The company even shut down the incinerator for extended periods of time. Laidlaw’s permit was temporarily revised to 10 ppb but before the new permit was issued, 500 permit violations had occurred.
Laidlaw was sued by environmental groups, which sought civil penalties ($25,000 per day) for each mercury exceedance (based on the 1.3 ppb standard, which was eventually dropped as impossible). At trial, no acceptable evidence that Laidlaw’s emissions had caused harm to fish or the river was provided. Yet Laidlaw was fined $405,800. This was much less than the $10 million that could have been imposed, since the court found that Laidlaw had made good faith efforts to meet the impossible 1.3 ppb standard. But the message of the court was clear: Permits may not be challenged. The federal statute requires payment of penalties when permits are violated. Practicality, evidence of harm, and science may be irrelevant.
Compare the Laidlaw case with the common-law approach. The facts of the case indicate that there were no damages and that the defendant had incurred extraordinary costs to meet a standard that went far beyond any reasonable rule for protecting safety and health. The plaintiffs would not have been able to claim personal or property damages, and the government authorities could not have supported any claim of harm to the public or the environment. In short, there was no basis for a private or public nuisance action. A common-law action probably would have had no merit. Yet, as in many other modern instances, the Laidlaw episode involved the expenditure of millions of dollars on equipment and legal expenditures in an effort to meet a standard that was found impossible to achieve. Huge costs and little or no benefits occur when standards are not related to health or safety.
Common Law Today
Although statute law has sharply constrained common law, common law is still alive and kicking. Unfortunately, combining common law with statutes can generate curious outcomes–including those that impose heavy regulatory costs with little benefit.
In some instances, lawyers add common-law pleadings to a statute-based case, always hoping that something will “stick” when the case is heard. Concerned Area Residents for the Environment (CARE) v. Southview Farms is a case in point.(44)
CARE was a citizen suit brought against a dairy operation (Southview) under the Clean Water Act. The suit was augmented by a common-law claim of trespass. Since standing was provided by statute, the plaintiffs did not have to show evidence of damages to get their day in court.
Southview operated a 1,100-acre farm in New York with 2,200 animals. The farm operator collected the animal manure and spread it on agricultural land. Until the CARE case, most farm operations were exempt from Clean Water Act rules; no EPA permits were required to operate manure-spreading tractors. Common law offered the primary remedy for parties who were harmed, and, as we have shown, common-law rules are strict when there is evidence of harm.
After heavy rains, runoff from Southview’s fields washed into a local creek and then into the Genesee River. The neighbors complained to the regulators. State regulators and the EPA refused to take action because of a lack of evidence that Southview was a statutory polluter. Armed with citizen-suit provisions of the Clean Water Act, the neighbors sued, simultaneously arguing that their common-law rights were violated. Eventually, the neighbors won and Southview paid a small fine for trespass.
Because of the link between common law and statutory regulations, the case had national implications. The Court of Appeals held that all manure-spreading tractors are point-source polluters! There are thousands of them. According to this interpretation, farmers nationwide must have EPA permits to operate manure spreaders. The interaction between statute and common law had produced a mixed outcome. Common-law rights were upheld, but the new interpretation of the regulatory term “concentrated animal feeding operation” imposed high costs on all farm operators with large herds, whether they have runoff problems or not.
A thorough review of statute-based environmental suits suggests that Laidlaw and CARE–examples in which high costs are imposed even where there is no evidence of harm–are not outliers. They are typical of a host of actions that drive an environmental juggernaut. This juggernaut has little to do with protecting environmental assets and much to do with maintaining a costly administrative structure, and the interest groups and bureaucrats supported by that structure.
The record of common-law cases is clear: It imposes tough liability on those who damage the environment. Yes, mistakes are made. Sometimes liability is imposed when it should not be; sometimes the damages assessed are too high; sometimes liability is not imposed when it should be. But it seems far better for such individual mistakes to be made (some of which are rectified on appeal) than for politically inspired policies to impose costs on all.
Few areas of the environment are not protected by the common law. Despite the political handwringing over the Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska, the legislative result–the Oil Pollution Act of 1990–was completely unnecessary. In fact, a common-law jury imposed a multi-billion dollar judgment in that incident. That judgment was excessive, but the point is that Exxon and other firms are well aware of their potential liability. They do not need Congress to appoint regulators to tell them how to conduct their business. That will not prevent accidents more effectively than the common law will. But at least common law gives potential polluters an incentive to guard against pollution and penalizes them when they fail to do so.
The largest verdicts in the nation are often for common-law environmental cases. In 1996 a Kentucky jury awarded $218 million against Rockwell International for PCB contamination of water (National Law Journal 1996, A9). In 1997 a New Orleans jury awarded $3.6 billion in damages for a chemical leak from railroad cars that affected 8,000 people (National Law Journal 1998, C2). These judgments may be inappropriately large, and they are among the reasons there are calls for tort reform, but no one can assert that common-law suits for environmental harms do not inspire a greater need for care than does fear of crossing the EPA.
The Lure of Central Planning
Why, if environmental quality is the goal, was the common law abandoned in favor of central planning and political control?
Political control of the environment cannot be based on evidence of superior performance by governmental bodies. The evidence continues to mount that governments are poor environmental stewards and that government regulation is wasteful, cumbersome, and sometimes ineffective. “For all its accomplishments, we conclude that the pollution control regulatory system is deeply and fundamentally flawed,” wrote Clarence Davies and Jan Mazurek (1997, 2) of Resources for the Future after conducting a comprehensive three-year assessment of U.S. environmental regulation. Expressing concern about failed federal efforts to build an efficient pollution control system, they concluded: “The United States does not need to wait for a consensus to act: to do so would be to wait forever. Failure to make the changes will be costly to the economy, to the environment, and to every citizen” (Davies and Mazurek 1997, 2).
Yet the idea that the law and the market have failed, rather than the regulatory system, is today’s received wisdom, and the claim is routinely made that insightful political leaders, aided by economists and other theoreticians, can resolve these difficult problems. This idea, which the great economist Friedrich Hayek called the fatal conceit, explains the lure of central planning, which is the alternative to common-law protection.
Politicians can advance their careers by convincing voters of their superior ability to manage problems. Only on rare occasions do politicians yield control, as in the case of transportation deregulation. Such instances are usually driven by special-interest politics that happen to produce results consistent with consumer interests, or else by market competition.
While politicians can perhaps be excused for supporting notions that further their careers, less defensible are the members of academia and other “learned professions” who provide intellectual respectability for destructive central planning. Yet they too have fallen under the sway of misguided theory. Submitting to the “nirvana” fallacy, they often believe that markets will operate better if they are “planned” than if they operate freely under a consistent rule of law. Nowhere is this fallacy more prevalent than with environmental protection.
While it is appropriate to recognize the limitations of the common law in the field of environmental protection, supporters of centralized environmental controls act as if today’s statutory approach has no comparable limitations. For example, one critic accuses free market environmentalism advocates of “wishful thinking” about the common law (Thompson 1996, 1359) while failing to address any of the shortcomings of today’s political and bureaucratic system.
It should not be surprising that many policy experts are disdainful of free market environmentalism, which is built on voluntary action and common-law rights supplemented by local rules. Economists and other experts preached for decades that electricity and telephones were natural monopolies. Competitive markets simply could not exist in the face of such monopolies, they said; there was a “market failure” that had to be remedied by government control. Now that the deregulation of transportation and communication has led to dramatic reductions in costs, and the deregulation of electricity is promising to do the same, the argument has switched to environmental problems. Surely, they must be caused by “market failure.”
Would-be central planners argue that when it comes to the environment, markets and the law on which the nation was founded cannot protect us. Instead, we must have knowing, wise leaders with the “institutional expertise to fully evaluate complex scientific and technical evidence” and the ability to “make important policy decisions” (Thompson 1996, 1363). Americans, like children, need their help. Needless to say, we disagree.
Conclusion
Several years ago we were asked by reporters from Forbes if we believed that the EPA should be abolished (Brimelow and Spencer 1992, 432). It seemed at first like a radical notion. But it is a logical extension of the history reported here. The Interstate Commerce Commission and the Civil Aeronautics Board have disappeared, and the railroads, trucks, and airlines still function–substantially more efficiently than when regulation “saved” us from exploitation. We are seeing the benefits of communication and electrical service deregulation. Perhaps the environment could be next.
If so, we would be able to return to the regime that served us well in the past and that has shown signs of evolving as knowledge and environmental concerns began to change. The common law provides harsh penalties against firms that disregard the rights of citizens by exposing them to harms. Indeed, when real harm is inflicted, citizens get far better relief through common-law suits than they do from appeals to the Environmental Protection Agency.
Ideas have consequences. Eventually, citizens will recognize that the common law, bolstered by local regulation, can protect the environment more effectively and fairly than can congressional statutes and bureaucratic regulations.

ifsecglobal,https://www.ifsecglobal.com/uncategorized/environmental-impact-of-foam/ ,"Although highly effective when used against fuel pool fires, all firefighting foams have a degree of environmental impact. Tom Cortina examines the different types of foams and systems available and compares their green credentials.
Firefighting foams are highly effective in preventing, suppressing and extinguishing fuel pool fires. When used in well-designed systems with the proper equipment, they can be the most effective method for doing so, and can be used in an environmentally responsible way. But since all firefighting foams (actually all firefighting systems) have some degree of environmental impacts and liabilities, an essential step in designing and planning for their use must take into account the protection of the environment.
Marketing claims have been made that certain firefighting foams are more environmentally friendly than others. The claim is, usually, that environmental laws do not regulate the solvent or the surfactant used in the ‘environmentally friendly’ foam. However, all firefighting foams are regulated at one point or another during their life, especially when they are used in training or for a fire event, regardless of the particular solvent or surfactant used in the foam. These firefighting foams are regulated because they have ingredients directly listed in environmental laws or have properties – including foaming itself – that can cause an environmental impact or liability during storage, use and discharge into the environment. Substituting one foam for another may make small improvements in environmental protection. But the best method of ensuring such protection is to design the system properly with the correct amount of foam and water, carry out required system maintenance, prevent accidental discharges, and provide a method of capture and control for any foam discharges.
Firefighting foams and systems
There are several types of firefighting foams available including: Aqueous Film Forming Foam (AFFF); Alcohol-Resistant AFFF; Protein Foams; Alcohol Resistant Protein Foams; Fluoroprotein Foams; Class A Foams; Medium and High Expansion Foams; Wetting Agents; Training Foams; and others. Each of these is used for different purposes, or because of standards and specification that require their use in specific systems. They usually come in a concentrate that is diluted with water and agitated to form a foam solution.
Foams are normally used for fixed facility systems or on fire and rescue trucks in locations where fuel pool fires are expected. When used in fixed facility systems, the design should incorporate a diversion and/or containment structure that will collect or treat the foam prior to removal or release. This will prevent it from entering the environment and the subsequent environmental impact or liability. When used on fire and rescue trucks, standard procedures should be set in place that capture and contain the foam flow. Although safety and fire suppression or extinguishment is paramount, the properly designed system and standard procedures will protect the environment as well.
Aquatic toxicity
Toxicity analysis focuses on the plants or animals most likely affected and the route of entry that will cause the worst effects. In the case of foams, plants and animals in water are the ones that are most likely to be affected by exposure and the exposure will generally be through ingestion or respiration. This type of toxicity is known as aquatic toxicity, which is an indicator of the relative toxicity of a chemical or compound in water. It is determined by using a series of tests to discover the acute (short term) or chronic (long term) toxicity, expressed as EC50 (Effective Concentration 50), LC50 (Lethal Concentration 50), or several other parameters.
The toxicity is compared to a standard toxicity reference to determine its potential impact, and evaluated based on use-specific conditions. Several scales are available; one example, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) scale is provided in the following chart (this scale is highly situation-specific and should not be used as a planning tool or guidance for relative toxicity without consulting a qualified toxicologist). Toxicity parameters are counter-intuitive – the higher the number, the less toxic the material. In concentrate form, many foams range from practically non-toxic to slightly toxic. When diluted to the fire extinguishing solution, almost all are typically categorised as relatively harmless.
In order to directly compare the toxicity of different firefighting foam agents, six foam concentrates were tested for acute toxicity in two different aquatic species. Test concentrates included three AFFF agents, a wetting agent, and two ‘fluorine-free’ foams. The AFFF agents that were chosen are alcohol resistant (AR-AFFF), meet Underwriters Laboratories (UL) specifications and meet US military specifications (milspec, Mil-F-24385). The wetting agent and fluorine-free foams were chosen because they are often marketed as environmentally friendly alternatives to AFFF. All of the foam concentrates tested were from stocks of commercially available products, and all except the wetting agent were 3% concentrates.
The two tests performed were the 96-hour LC50 Test in Fingerling Rainbow Trout2 and the 96-hour LC50 flow-through test in Fathead minnows3. Both tests involve exposing fish to water containing different concentrations of the test substance for four days and determining the concentration that is lethal to half of the fish. In the Fathead minnow flow-through test, water containing the test substances flows in and out of the test chamber at a rate of six changes every 24 hours. In the rainbow trout test, the water is aerated but not changed over the four-day test period.
These two tests have been used by industry and the United States Department of Agriculture Forest Service for many years, to evaluate the environmental impact of firefighting foams.4 Fathead minnows are often used to measure the aquatic toxicity of AFFF-type agents and rainbow trout are often used to measure the aquatic toxicity of class A foams and wetting agents.
Results
Results from acute toxicity testing in rainbow trout and fathead minnows are presented in Tables 2 and 3 and Figures 1 and 2. The wetting agent had the highest acute toxicity of the foam concentrates tested with an LC50 of about 1 mg/L for both aquatic species. It would be classified as moderately to highly toxic according to the FWS scale. The two fluorine-free foams were an order of magnitude lower in toxicity than the wetting agent, ranging from 65-171 mg/L. These concentrates would be considered slightly toxic to practically non-toxic according to the FWS scale. The AFFF agents were the least toxic of the foam concentrates tested, ranging from 884 to 5657 mg/L, which is an order of magnitude lower in toxicity than the fluorine-free foams. AFFF concentrates would be considered practically non-toxic to relatively harmless, according to the FWS scale.
The results from this testing programme are consistent with other published data, and with information on aquatic toxicity presented on the material safety data sheets (MSDS) for these agents. Gaikowski et al tested two commercially available Class A foams that are likely to be somewhat similar in make-up to fluorine-free foams A and B, and obtained LC50 values ranging from 13-32 mg/L in fathead minnows and 11-78 mg/L in Rainbow Trout.5, 6
It is not surprising, despite marketing claims to the contrary, that wetting agents and fluorine-free foams would have higher acute aquatic toxicity than AFFF agents. AFFF agents contain fluorinated surfactants that provide a positive spreading coefficient and enable film formation on top of lighter fuels. It is this film-forming characteristic that makes AFFF agents highly effective. Foam agents that do not contain fluorinated surfactants usually contain higher concentrations of hydrocarbon surfactants and solvents, in order to compensate for the lack of film formation. Hydrocarbon surfactants and solvents are generally more toxic in aquatic systems than fluorinated surfactants, so this likely explains the higher aquatic toxicity of the non-fluorinated foams as compared to AFFF. It is also not surprising that milspec AFFF has a slightly higher toxicity than AR-AFFF and that AR-AFFF has a slightly higher toxicity than UL AFFF. Milspec AFFF contains a higher content of surfactants and solvents than AR-AFFF, which contains a higher content of surfactants and solvents than UL AFFF.
Conclusion
Fluorinated surfactants are persistent chemicals that have come under increased scrutiny in recent years as a result of the perfluorooctyl sulfonate (PFOS) issue. This scrutiny has encouraged some manufacturers to supplement their range of foams to provide fluorine-free products under the descriptive title of environmentally friendly alternatives to AFFF. But it is important to acknowledge that just because a foam agent does not contain fluorine, it is not necessarily safer for the environment, as illustrated by the higher aquatic toxicity of non-fluorinated foams as compared to AFFF.
Thomas Cortina is executive director of the Firefighting Foam Coalition, a US industry association representing AFFF interests. He is also executive director of the Halon Alternatives Research Corporation and has a background in environmental and toxicology research.

theguardian,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/datablog/2012/jun/21/world-carbon-emissions-league-table-country ,"The world emits 48% more carbon dioxide from the consumption of energy now than it did in 1992 when the first Rio summit took place.
The new data shows the rise of Asia, big increases in emissions in Africa, how Europe has plateaued - and how Iran has shot up the league table.
China - the world's biggest emitter of CO2 - has increased by 240%, as
The new data, published by the US Energy Information Administration this week, is the most comprehensive carbon emissions data with statistics for over 200 countries around the world since 1980.
The world emitted 31.8bn tonnes of carbon dioxide from the consumption of energy in 2010 - up 6.7% on the year before. The figure is up by 48% on 1992, when the first Rio summit took place.
China - which only went into first place in 2006 - is racing ahead of the US, too. It emitted 8.3bn tonnes of CO2 in 2010 - up 240% on 1992, 15.5% on the previous year.
Meanwhile, US emissions are up for the first time since recession hit in 2008, in a sign of how closely pollution is linked to economic success.
Here are some of the key facts:
• China now emits 48% more CO2 than the USA - and is responsible for a quarter of the world's emissions
• The UK's emissions are down 8% on 1992, and it has moved from 7th to 10th place since 1992
• In contrast, Iran has moved from 21st place to 8th place in 2010, overtaking the UK and Canada
• Gibraltar has the highest per capita emissions in the world - 135.3 tonnes per person per year, compared to 8.5 tonnes in the UK and 6.3 tonnes in China
There are other sources of emissions data too, if you want to compare - albeit not as up-to-date:
• The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) gathers the data on world carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. This is only available up to 2008.
• the International Energy Agency (IEA) has global carbon emissions data up to 2009
The full data from the EIA is below. What can you do with it?

Whilst our operational coverage spans across the planet, a comparatively small ecological footprint is produced when compared to other sectors. Nevertheless, we are committed to being leaders in environmental sustainability and our firmwide Environmental Policy is guided by the United Nations Global Compact environment principles; the International Standards Organisation Environmental Management Systems 14001:2015; and the Sustainable Development Goals to ensure continuous improvement.
Leadership and commitment
The Corporate Responsibility Committee, with delegated authority from the Partnership Board, endorses the firmwide environment programme, including the environmental policy. This support intersects with the skills, enthusiasm and capabilities of those responsible for environment in their jurisdiction, most of who manage environment in addition to other core responsibilities e.g. operations, office management, finance.
We are one of only two global law firms to hold firmwide accreditation of the environmental management system (EMS) to ISO 14001:2015; this independent assurance and certification, provides the confidence to our people, clients, and other interested parties that environmental improvements are always underway across our locations.
The EMS has enabled the identification of six areas of focus: climate change, resource conservation, waste management, pollution prevention, biodiversity and taking action. Therefore, environmental impacts are monitored, measured and reduced through innovative initiatives; and engagement is fostered with our people, clients, supply chain partners and other relevant stakeholders.
As a CDP (formerly called the Carbon Disclosure Project) supply chain responders since 2012, Linklaters is the only global firm to have consistently disclosed firmwide greenhouse gas emissions. An A- score was achieved in 2020 for the fourth year in a row, retaining Linklaters CDP environmental stewardship leadership position, and the highest a global law firm has achieved to date. This demonstrates Linklaters is ‘implementing current best practices’.
Advising clients
Our Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) team has a robust understanding of the regulatory and policy drivers of the market and experience across a wide range of sectors and contexts. We take a holistic approach, covering a wide range of areas - from climate change and resource efficiency, human rights and community engagement, antibribery and corruption, transparency and disclosure, product governance, and risk management more generally.
Carbon neutral business
In celebration of the UNEP World Environment Day, in 2017 Linklaters became a carbon neutral business and in 2018 a new three year partnership was announced with ClimateCare to offset unavoidable emissions through the Gola Rainforest Project.
Achieving carbon neutrality followed a 10 year programme of reducing operational greenhouse gas emissions from energy use, business travel, waste and water. Emissions are offset from all scope 1 (e.g. gas use, refrigerant losses), scope 2 (i.e. purchased electricity which is not 100% renewable sourced) and scope 3 (e.g. business travel, electricity transmission and distribution, waste, waste and couriers). New environmental objectives which will ensure emissions continue to reduce are set annually.

Engaging our people
Since 2007 the firm has marked UNEP’s World Environment Day as the primary vehicle in raising awareness across the firm as a call to action for some of the world’s most challenging environmental issues. Themes have covered climate change and carbon emissions, energy efficiency, wildlife conservation, plastic pollution, sustainable and local food sourcing, resource conversation, re-use and upcycling and environmental law.
For almost as long as this, the firm has marked Earth Hour. Depending on the issues which are most important to our environment teams across the world, Earth Day, World Water Day and other days of significance are celebrated.
Collective action
We are both founding and executive members of the Legal Sustainability Alliance (LSA), an inclusive network of law firms and related organisations committed to working collaboratively to improve the environmental sustainability of their operations and activities. Linklaters is represented on the Leaders Group, the Taskforce, and subscribes to the LSA Principles.
Other partnerships include the City of London Corporation’s Air Quality Champions Awards and Clean City Awards Scheme, Business in the Community, and with EWS-WWF in the UAE.
Sustainable by design
Consideration is given to environmental certifications and/or ratings of new and existing buildings. For example, Linklaters are occupants in:
- an A-label building in Amsterdam, a LEED platinum and DGNB gold pre-certification building in Frankfurt,
- a ‘Class A’ building in Milan,
- a BCA Green Mark Scheme building in Singapore,
- a LEED Silver accredited building in Stockholm, and
- a BREEAM rated Excellent building in Warsaw. From summer 2020, we will occupy a LEED ‘Silver’ rated office in New York (certified in 2016).
From 2026, our headquarters will be in 20 Ropemaker, London which is designed to be a minimum BREEAM (Shell and Core) ‘Excellent’ rated building.
Environmental, health and wellbeing aspects are also included in the design process for fitting out new office space or when office space is refurbished. This has included using materials made from recycled components, re-using existing materials, minimising waste, installing LED lights, motion detectors and purchasing furniture with good environmental certifications and low chemical paints.
A positive dialogue with building management is key to the ongoing environmental performance of office space, and, in many locations for managing environmental data. In Hong Kong, for example, the building manager hosts tenant sustainability meetings.
Tangible Results
In 2017 the firmwide base year was re-stated to 2010 (previously 2007), achievements include greenhouse gas emissions:
- across scope 1, 2 and 3 reduced by 26%
- resulting from electricity reduced by 42%
In 2018, 73% of electricity was sourced from a 100% renewable supply.

At first, there were no recognised market standards to help determine what qualifies as a green or sustainability linked loan. While the Green Bond Principles first published by the International Capital Markets Association in January 2014 were a useful indication of the direction being taken in the capital markets, they focussed on bonds rather than loans, and on green use of proceeds rather than sustainability. In the loan markets, the Equator Principles have long been used by financial institutions for managing environmental, social and governance risks in the project finance market, but their application was limited in the wider loan markets.
Without the benefit of recognised market standards there was a risk of diverging approaches being taken on what amounts to a green or sustainability linked loan. At its worst, that risked loans being presented as green or sustainability linked, when in reality they were little different to an ordinary loan, sometimes referred to as “green washing”.
Market standards for green loans were published by recognised industry associations in March 2018, and were followed in March 2019 by sustainability linked loan standards. Green and sustainability linked loans are now recognised products globally.
The drivers for the growth in green and sustainability linked loans are changing. What started as a mostly voluntary approach to addressing climate change risks and the need for businesses to act responsibly is beginning to be overtaken by regulation. In a speech in 2015, the Governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, set out how the catastrophic impacts of climate change will be felt beyond the traditional horizons of most banks, investors and financial policy makers, imposing costs on future generations. He warned that once climate change becomes a defining issue for financial stability it may be too late, and noted that risks to financial stability will be minimised if the transition towards a lower-carbon economy begins early and follows a predictable path.
Considerable progress has been made in the years since that speech. In March 2019, Mark Carney spoke of a step change in demand and supply of climate reporting, the push to better climate change risk management and how advances in reporting and risk analysis are paving the way for investors to realise the opportunities in climate-friendly investment.
A raft of national and international initiatives on climate change and corporate governance are starting to change how companies operate. There seems little doubt that in the face of ever increasing pressure, the growth of the green and sustainability linked loan markets is set to continue.
One of the hurdles faced by the green and sustainable finance market generally is the potential for green washing. In October 2018, the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (the “FCA”) issued a discussion paper on “Climate Change and Green Finance”, which noted that:
“Minimum standards can be helpful for enhancing investor confidence and trust and enabling markets to develop. For example, minimum standards may help ensure investors understand what they are buying and prevent misleading ‘green washing’ of financial products and services. Green washing is marketing that portrays an organisation’s products, activities or policies as producing positive environmental outcomes when this is not the case.”
Minimum standards have been developed for the loan markets. The Loan Market Association (“LMA”), Asia Pacific Loan Market Association (“APLMA”) and the Loan Syndications and Trading Association (“LSTA”) launched their Green Loan Principles with the support of the International Capital Market Association (“ICMA”) in March 2018. The Green Loan Principles are similar in scope to ICMA’s own Green Bond Principles. The initiative began in 2017 at the instigation of the Global Green Finance Council, of which the LMA and ICMA are founder members, and the APLMA, which established a working group in 2016.
A year later, in March 2019, the Sustainability Linked Loan Principles were published by the LMA, APLMA and the LSTA.
Both the Green Loan Principles and the Sustainability Linked Loan Principles are voluntary frameworks, widespread adoption of which would mitigate the risks of green washing in the loan markets.
The Green Loan Principles establish four key criteria:
The fundamental defining feature of a green loan is that the proceeds are applied for green purposes. The Green Loan Principles include a non-exhaustive list of green projects towards which the proceeds of the loan could be applied, and require that the relevant green project provides clear environmental benefits.
Green borrowers are expected to communicate certain key information to their lenders including details of their wider environmental sustainability objectives, the process by which they determine whether their projects are eligible green initiatives and the related eligibility criteria. They are also expected to provide details of any wider green standards to which they seek to conform.
The Green Loan Principles provide that the proceeds of a green loan should be credited to a dedicated account, or otherwise tracked by the borrower in an appropriate manner. This requirement is aimed at ensuring transparent use of proceeds for eligible green purposes in order to promote the credibility of green loans. By holding green loan proceeds separately, borrowers can more easily ensure that they are applied towards the purposes for which they are drawn, particularly where the facility may be used for more than one purpose.
This also reduces the risk that proceeds are applied for other purposes and are not available to fund the relevant green project. Where the loan proceeds are to be applied over a period of time, borrowers are likely to prefer a staggered drawdown profile to drawing the whole amount of the loan to hold in a deposit account pending application (since the interest received on that deposit is likely to be less than the interest accruing on the drawn loan).
It is acknowledged in the Green Loan Principles that tracing the use of loan proceeds can be easier with a term loan than a revolving facility because revolving facilities tend to be flexible in the purposes for which they may be drawn. This can be addressed by structuring the facilities into separate tranches to make tracing easier – there are examples of revolving facilities split into tranches for general corporate purposes and for green purposes, for instance.
The borrower of a green loan is required to record the green projects towards which proceeds are applied, together with a description of the project, the amount allocated and the expected impact of the project. Borrowers should renew that information annually and report it to their lenders.
The Green Loan Principles recommend (but do not require) third party oversight, and acknowledge that borrowers can seek guidance and input on their green loan processes in a variety of ways – examples include taking advice from external environmental consultants on their activities and arranging certification against external green assessment standards.
The key distinction between a green loan and a sustainability linked loan is that categorisation as a sustainability linked loan is not conditional on the proceeds being used for a particular purpose. Instead, the defining feature is that the terms of the loan incentivise the borrower to improve its performance against certain pre-determined environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) criteria. In practice this would typically mean that the pricing on the loan is directly linked to the sustainability performance of the borrower.
Green loans
Sustainability linked loans
Aim
To facilitate and support environmentally sustainable
economic activity.
To facilitate and support environmentally and
socially sustainable economic activity.
Definition
Loan instruments made available exclusively
to finance or refinance new or existing
“green projects”.
Loan instruments and/or contingent facilities (such
as bonding lines, guarantee lines or letters of credit)
which incentivise the borrower’s achievement
of ambitious, predetermined sustainability
performance objectives.
Restrictions on purpose
The fundamental feature is the utilisation of the loan
for “green projects”. The Green Loan Principles set
out a non-exhaustive list of 10 categories of green
projects, including renewable energy, energy
efficiency and pollution prevention and control.
Loan proceeds should be credited to a dedicated
account or otherwise tracked.
No specific requirement for use of proceeds
– loan could be for a borrower’s general
corporate purposes.
Impact on pricing of borrower performance
No pricing impact is contemplated in the
Green Loan Principles.
There are facilities which have been split into
tranches for green purposes and for other purposes
where the green tranche attracts lower pricing.
The hallmark of a sustainability linked loan is that
the borrower’s performance against predetermined
sustainability objectives affects the interest rate,
incentivising improved performance over time.
The Sustainability Linked Loan Principles set out
a non-exhaustive list of 10 common categories
of objectives, including reduced greenhouse gas
emissions, reduced water consumption and the
amount of renewable energy generated or used by
the borrower.
Review/reporting
Borrowers should maintain records of the use of
green loan proceeds, including a list of the green
projects to which the proceeds have been allocated
together with a description of the project, amount
allocated and the expected impact. External review
is recommended but not required.
The need for external review of the borrower’s
performance against its predetermined sustainability
objectives is decided on a case by case basis.
For public companies, public disclosures may be
sufficient to verify performance for the purposes of
the loan.
Global green and sustainability linked loan volumes exceeded
US$99bn
in 2018
A look at aggregate volumes of sustainability linked loans by jurisdiction over recent years shows that European jurisdictions are particularly active (see Figure 3), but the product reaches into markets globally.
Sustainability linked loan activity is spread across various sectors, but has been dominated by borrowers in the utilities, financials and consumer sectors (see Figure 4).
""Global green and sustainability linked loan volumes exceeded US$99bn in 2018, with sustainability linked loans accounting for US$43bn of that.""
European markets currently lead global sustainability linked loan volumes, with a share of more than 80% of the market (see Figure 5). Activity has focussed mostly on Spain, France and Italy.
While only a handful of sustainability linked loans have been made to US companies, aggregate volumes of announced deals to date total approximately US$11bn according to Bloomberg. Many of the larger transactions have been for subsidiaries of European companies that have entered into sustainability linked loans in their own right already.
Green and sustainability linked lending is also attracting considerable attention in the Asia Pacific markets. The first sustainability linked loan in the region was reported to have been signed in March 2018, and the first green loan dates back to September 2018, both for Singaporean companies. Sustainability linked loans have also been signed in Hong Kong. Singapore features in the top 10 countries by aggregate sustainability linked loan volumes since 2017.
""European jurisdictions are particularly active in sustainability linked loans, but the product reaches into markets globally.""
The Equator Principles were first published in 2003 and incorporate the International Finance Corporation Performance Standards and the World Bank Group’s technical industry guidelines for projects in emerging markets. The Equator Principles are intended to help ensure that project finance transactions are undertaken in a socially responsible way and in accordance with appropriate environmental management practices.
While widely adopted in the project finance sector, the Equator Principles are rarely encountered in ordinary corporate loan transactions. The introduction of the Green Loan Principles may have broader reach into other parts of the loan markets, but they are less established than the Equator Principles.
While the Green Loan Principles do not contemplate the pricing on the loan being linked to green use of proceeds, that linkage has been a feature of some corporate financings. In one example, a revolving credit facility for general corporate purposes was split into two tranches – the first tranche, which was available for general corporate purposes did not benefit from any discount, but the second tranche, which was available only for green purposes had reduced pricing.
""Two-way pricing mechanisms better incentivise performance by providing for a pricing reduction if sustainability criteria are met, and applying a pricing increase where performance declines.""
Early financings were structured such that if the borrower satisfied its sustainability criteria, the margin on the loan was reduced. The size of that reduction varied between loans and markets, but might typically be in the range of 0.02% to 0.04% on a general corporate financing. In some markets the discount might be higher – as much as 0.10% to 0.20%.
Where sustainability targets were not met, the margin calculation mechanism on those financings had no penalty for poor performance. Instead the margin reduction was simply not applied.
More recently, two-way pricing mechanisms have been introduced on some deals. Two-way pricing mechanisms better incentivise performance by providing for a pricing reduction if sustainability criteria are met, and applying a pricing increase where performance declines.
The underlying objective of incentivising borrowers to make improvements to their sustainability profile is probably more likely to be achieved through two-way pricing mechanisms, but it is possible that they could be viewed in a less positive way – after all, they result in lenders making greater returns on loans from borrowers who are not meeting sustainability targets.
There are examples of alternative structures being considered, which could mitigate that concern. One idea replaces increases in pricing with a requirement to make additional payments into a separate bank account should sustainability targets not be met. Those amounts could then be reinvested into improving the sustainability profile of the borrower.
""As the market becomes more sophisticated, rating methodologies are becoming more tailored.""
The Sustainability Linked Loan Principles state that the need for external review of the borrower’s ESG performance is to be negotiated and agreed on a transaction by transaction basis. Where information relating to sustainability performance targets is not publicly available or otherwise accompanied by an audit or assurance statement, the Sustainability Linked Loan Principles recommend that external review of those targets is sought. Even where data is publicly disclosed, independent external review may be desirable. The majority of deals signed to date require external review rather than relying on self-reporting. This is in some ways similar to the requirement for an independent environmental and social consultant under the Equator Principles.
A number of factors influence whether third party oversight is required by lenders. At a general level, the integrity of the product is promoted by credible independent review. In many cases, self-reporting is not feasible because borrowers do not have the internal expertise to perform the role themselves. Larger corporates, which may have the necessary internal expertise to self-report, are encouraged by the Sustainability Linked Loan Principles to thoroughly document that expertise and their internal processes.
One reason borrowers might prefer to self-report is to avoid incurring an increased cost burden. It is worth bearing in mind the wider trend toward companies assessing and reporting on their ESG performance for other purposes, so to the extent information is already being gathered, it may be possible to repurpose it for a lower incremental cost.
A less obvious concern is the potential for external ESG rating providers to change their methodologies unilaterally. There are many entities in the market that research and rate corporate sustainability, although reporting in the loans market is concentrated on a smaller group of providers.
Each of the ESG rating agencies considers various data points to arrive at their respective ratings. Their rating methodologies are not only varied from each other, but evolve over time. In part that reflects shifts in perception towards particular risk factors – what is considered green or sustainable today may be less so tomorrow. For example, the production of electric vehicles might in some cases rely on the transport and use of raw materials that are extracted using polluting methods or perhaps involving poor employment conditions. Early ESG ratings tended not to differentiate between sectors when assessing the relevance of particular risks, but as the market becomes more sophisticated, rating methodologies are becoming more tailored.
Evolving rating methodologies can also be the result of consolidation in the market. For example, Sustainalytics acquired ESG Analytics in 2015. Vigeo Eiris was formed in 2015 by the merger of Vigeo and Eiris, both of which were ESG data providers. There are also moves from credit rating agencies into the market – Moody’s acquired a majority stake in Vigeo Eiris in April 2019.
Concerns have been raised about the low correlation between different ESG rating agencies’ assessment of the same company, which contrasts with the strong positive correlation generally seen in the context of credit ratings. This is a challenge for investors seeking a comparative assessment across companies with ratings provided by different sources. It is perhaps less of a problem in the loan markets where a particular ESG rating agency’s rating is being used to demonstrate an improvement in the performance of the borrower over time rather than to compare different borrowers. In time, the industry may well develop a more uniform approach, but to get there will require greater standardisation of the various methodologies used currently.
Changing methodologies could create a potential difficulty for the sustainability linked loans market. It is agreed when the loan is entered into that the pricing will change by reference to whether particular ESG performance targets are hit. If a rating agency changes its calculation methodology for whatever reason during the life of the loan, and that results in changes to a particular corporate’s rating, the pricing on the loan may also change. Whether or not methodology changes are significant enough to have a substantial impact is another question.
It is not uncommon for the facility agreement to include a list of possible rating providers or otherwise contemplate that the rating provider could change over the life of the loan.
The suggested criteria listed in the Sustainability Linked Loan Principles are indicative only – the critical factor is that the criteria chosen are ambitious and meaningful to the borrower’s business.
Market participants are not tied to using only the criteria listed in the Sustainability Linked Loan Principles. Metrics such as target CO2 emissions are common, but there are examples of novel criteria relevant to the borrower’s business, such as the proportion of electric vehicles in an electricity company’s fleet, or improvements in uptake of energy consumption monitoring tools among customers of a utility company. Criteria can be tailored to the business – for instance, the three-year average intensity of CO2 emissions in kilograms per megawatt hour of power produced by an electricity company.
It is common for pricing to be set by reference to the borrower’s overall ESG rating (which is typically expressed on a scale of 0 to 100, although some ESG rating agencies use a scale similar to that of the credit rating agencies). The borrower’s ESG rating is usually assessed annually, and a discount (or increase) to the applicable margin is applied if the ESG rating has moved more than a few points higher or lower than the initial ESG rating at the time the loan was entered into. The threshold for a change to the ESG rating to impact the applicable margin varies, but tends to be in the range of two to five points (on a scale of 0 to 100). The annual changes to the margin are not usually cumulative – the discount (or increase) is applied each year to the originally applicable margin if the ESG rating has moved sufficiently from the initial ESG rating, rather than to an already discounted (or increased) figure.
On transactions where specific ESG criteria are used rather than an overall rating, different discounts (or increases) can be applied for each specific target that is met. The alternative is an all or nothing approach that requires all targets to be met before the pricing changes.
""It is common for pricing to be set by reference to the borrower’s overall ESG rating, typically expressed on a scale of 0 to 100.""
Adoption of the Equator Principles referred to earlier in this report is voluntary, but many financial institutions use the Equator Principles as a primary tool for managing ESG risks and impacts in the project finance market. The Equator Principles paved the way for other sustainability initiatives in the loan markets.
The UN Principles for Responsible Investment (“UNPRI”) are a longstanding voluntary initiative to incorporate ESG issues into investment practice. The UNPRI focus on, amongst other things, the incorporation of ESG issues into investment analysis and ownership policies and the disclosure of ESG issues.
The shift to embed climate and ESG risk factors into corporate decision making gained further traction following the Paris Agreement in 2015. In December 2015, the Financial Stability Board announced the establishment of an industry-led Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, with the goal of developing voluntary, consistent climate-related financial risk disclosures for use by companies in providing information to lenders, insurers, investors and other stakeholders. In June 2017, the Task Force published its recommendations (the “TCFD Recommendations”), which give guidance on how to disclose clear, comparable and consistent information about the risks and opportunities presented by climate change. The core elements of the TCFD Recommendations concern governance, strategy (including scenario analysis), risk management and metrics and targets, each in relation to climate risk.
The impact of the TCFD Recommendations is significant, with financial institutions increasingly taking note of the TCFD Recommendations in their sustainability disclosures. There is potential for compliance with the TCFD Recommendations to become mandatory (on a comply or explain basis) in the near to medium term.
As part of its programme to fulfil commitments made pursuant to the Paris Agreement, the European Commission adopted a sustainable finance action plan. The European Commission unveiled its strategy for a financial system that supports the EU’s climate and sustainable development agenda in 2018. The action plan on sustainable finance has three main objectives:
The first legislative measures under the action plan on sustainable finance are contained in the EU Sustainable Finance Package. Some elements were agreed in late Spring 2019. Those introduce a regulation on carbon benchmarks to establish regulated categories of low-carbon indices to help investors to compare the carbon footprint of their investments, establish rules for regulated firms to incorporate ESG matters into their investment decision making and advisory processes and require additional disclosures for specific ESG products.
The remaining part of the EU Sustainable Finance Package is a new taxonomy regulation, together with a detailed draft taxonomy issued pursuant to it, that defines what activities are eligible to be the subject of sustainable finance. The draft technical taxonomy published in June 2019 is intended to be finalised by the end of 2019. Once in final form and in force (which will not be before 2021), it will require the application of a series of tests to determine whether activities qualify as climate mitigation focussed activities or climate adaptation focussed activities, each eligible for sustainable finance.
In order for an activity to qualify as climate mitigation focussed, this involves:
In order for an activity to be considered climate adaptation focussed, the first two tests outlined above are replaced by:
While the taxonomy will not be applicable to bank lending as a matter of EU regulation, it is possible that over time the market may choose to apply it voluntarily, for example in response to customer or other regulatory expectations.
The European Banking Authority stated in its 2018 Annual Report that it is conducting market analysis and research on ESG factors and that sustainable finance will continue to be an important area in its work.
The European Non-Financial Reporting Directive (Directive (EU) 2014/95) (the “NFRD”) came into force in the UK from 1 January 2017. The NFRD requires large companies which are public interest entities (broadly, EU-listed companies, certain credit institutions and insurance undertakings) to report publicly on environmental, social and employment matters, respect for human rights and anti-corruption and bribery matters. In non-binding guidance in relation to the NFRD, the European Commission cross-referred to the TCFD Recommendations, showing the convergence in climate change related disclosures.
Related developments in this area at an EU level are noted in the appendix to this report.
UK regulators and legislators are taking action too. The Prudential Regulation Authority (the “PRA”) published Policy Statement 11/19 and Supervisory Statement 3/19 on “Enhancing banks’ and insurers’ approaches to managing the financial risks from climate change” in April 2019. The Supervisory Statement sets out the PRA’s key expectations on how UK banks and insurance firms should address those risks at a strategic level. In it, the PRA makes clear that firms should:
Separately, the FCA is also considering climate change and green finance, including the adequacy of current disclosures in capital markets.
From October 2019, pension funds will be required to ensure that their statement of investment principles addresses any financially material considerations. This is defined specifically to include ESG factors, including climate change.
Related developments in this area in the UK are noted in the appendix to this report.
Climate- and ESG-related investor engagement is increasing. Shareholder activism is too. The International Organization of Securities Commissions, the internationally recognised global standard setter for the securities sector, has issued a statement on the importance of ESG-related matters when disclosing information material to investor decisions. Separately, at least one shareholder advisory body has updated its guidelines to make clear that it expects companies to publish information on their resilience to climate change as part of their wider environmental policy. Particular sectors have tended to concentrate on different ESG matters – climate change has been key in the energy sector, whilst social issues are more commonly encountered in the mining sector for example.
The general trend towards embedding climate- and ESG-related issues in business strategy, and on increased disclosure, is clear. It seems reasonable to expect that as the number of companies assessing and reporting on these matters grows, so will the number of companies able to re-use that same data for the purposes of green or sustainability linked loans.
The legislative package establishing the framework of regulatory capital, liquidity, leverage and regulatory disclosure rules applicable to European credit institutions and investment firms is set out in Regulation (EU) 575/2013 (the Capital Requirements Regulation or “CRR”) and Directive (EU) 2013/36 (the Capital Requirements Directive or “CRD”).
Under the current rules, institutions using the standardised approach to assess their borrower’s credit risk do not take ESG factors into account.
CRR will be amended by Regulation (EU) 2019/876 (“CRR 2”). While CRR 2 will not make changes to the regulatory capital treatment of green and sustainability linked loans generally in the short term, it will offer limited preferential treatment for certain highly prescribed arrangements and require the development of governance and disclosure frameworks and the integration of ESG risks into regulated firms’ risk management policies. In particular:
The proposed European prudential regulatory regime for investment firms (set out in a draft regulation known as the “IFR” and a draft directive known as the “IFD”) has a similar emphasis:
Turning to the UK, the PRA and the FCA have established the Climate Financial Risk Forum (“CFRF”). The objective of the CFRF is to build capacity and share best practice across financial regulators and industry to advance financial sector responses to the financial risks from climate change. The work of the CFRF, combined with the PRA’s international work with the Central Banks and Supervisors Network for Greening the Financial System helps to inform the PRA’s approach to climate change policy.
The PRA’s recently published Policy Statement 11/19 and Supervisory Statement 3/19 on “Enhancing banks’ and insurers’ approaches to managing the financial risks from climate change” referred to earlier in this report focus on the impact of climate change on the value of assets and on wider socioeconomic developments which could have an indirect impact on the risks faced by regulated firms. For these purposes, the PRA has broadly split climate change risks into physical risks (such as extreme weather events causing damage to physical assets) and transition risks arising from the process of adjustment to a low carbon economy.
In the Policy Statement, the PRA notes that respondents to an earlier consultation paper had urged it to reflect climate-related financial risks in the capital framework. However, the Policy Statement confirms that the PRA “does not consider that differences in capital treatment for certain types of assets is appropriate at this stage given the lack of a consistent definition of assets with less climate-related risk, and lack of data or other evidence of a risk differential between them”.
The PRA’s expectations at this stage are for firms to:
Notably, the PRA indicates that it expects such analysis to be reflected in the formal internal capital adequacy assessment framework (ICAAP) which banks use, and the insurers’ equivalent framework (ORSA), though with no specific guidance as yet on how to do so.
The PRA expects firms to have clear roles and responsibilities for the board and its sub-committees in managing the financial risks from climate change – the board and the highest level of executive management should allocate responsibility for identifying and managing those risks to the most appropriate Senior Management Function.

Summary
The Sustainable Finance Package
The EU Sustainable Finance Package includes three main initiatives:
a regulation amending the European Benchmark Regulation to introduce new
categories of regulated benchmarks to help investors compare the carbon footprint
of their investments;
a regulation on disclosure requirements which will require a broad range of
regulated entities to disclose how they integrate ESG factors into their investment
decision making and advisory processes, as well as make specific disclosures for
certain ESG products; and
an ESG taxonomy regulation which will create a framework to assess whether
a particular economic activity can be considered environmentally sustainable,
and will require application of, and disclosure against, criteria for sustainable
investments
ESMA guidelines on disclosure
requirements applicable to
credit ratings
The European Securities and Markets Authority has been consulting on guidelines
for credit agencies, which would improve how credit agencies disclose their
consideration of ESG factors as part of the credit rating process.
ESMA and EIOPA technical advice
to the European Commission
The European Securities and Markets Authority and the European Insurance and
Occupational Pensions Authority have published technical advice to the European
Commission on the integration of ESG risks into a number of pieces of European
legislation, including Solvency II, the Insurance Distribution Directive, MiFID II, AIFMD
and the UCITS Directive.
EIOPA opinion on sustainability
within Solvency II
The European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority is consulting on an
opinion on sustainability within the current Solvency II framework which will inform
the European Commission’s review.
The Capital Requirements
Regulation 2 and Capital
Requirements Directive V Package,
and the Investment Firms
Regulation and Directive Package
CRR 2/CRD V and IFR/IFD both require ESG disclosures as part of “Pillar 3”
prudential regulatory requirements for investment firms and banks. Both packages
empower the European Banking Authority to consider the enactment of a dedicated
prudential treatment of ESG investments.
Shareholder Rights Directive II
SRD II requires shareholder engagement disclosures by both institutional investors
and asset managers. Whilst these disclosures are not directly focussed on ESG
matters, the intention of encouraging active shareholder engagement and long-term
stewardship overlaps with the sustainable finance agenda.
European Commission guidelines
on climate-related disclosures
The European Commission adopted guidelines on reporting climate-related
information in June 2019. These supplement existing guidelines on non-financial
reporting under EU Directive 2013/34 on the disclosure of non-financial and diversity
information by certain large undertakings and groups.
The guidelines build on the report published by the EU Technical Expert Group
on Sustainable Finance (“TEG”) in January 2019 on climate-related disclosures,
which recommends a wide range of disclosures in relation to climate-related risks
and opportunities.
TEG report on EU taxonomy
This TEG report lists economic activities which can make a substantial contribution
to climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation. The report is part of the
workstream on the proposed EU Taxonomy Regulation.
TEG report on an EU Green
Bond Standard
This report proposes a voluntary green bond standard to determine climate and
environmentally-friendly activities eligible for funding under green bonds.
TEG interim report on EU climate
benchmarks and disclosure by
benchmark providers
This interim report proposes the methodology and minimum technical requirements
for climate benchmarks and disclosure requirements for benchmark providers.

Summary
PRA supervisory statement
for banks and insurers on
managing the financial risks from
climate change
On 15 April 2019, the PRA released a Policy Statement and a Supervisory
Statement applicable to all UK banks and insurance firms. These set out the PRA’s
expectations on managing the financial risks from climate change. The PRA expects
that firms should:
> fully embed consideration of climate change risks in their governance
arrangements;
> take those risks into account in existing risk management practices;
> where appropriate, use scenario analysis to assess the impact of climate change
risks on their strategy and risk profile; and
> develop an appropriate approach to disclosure of climate-related financial risks.
Firms should have an initial plan to address the PRA’s expectations by 15 October
2019, and the PRA will publish more information in due course.
FCA consultation on climate change
and green finance
The FCA issued a discussion paper on climate change and green finance in October
2018, seeking views on the FCA’s proposed approach to the area to ensure the FCA
“continues to take decisions in the public interest and supports innovation in the
growing market for green finance”.
Reporting requirements for
large companies
The Companies (Miscellaneous Reporting) Regulations 2018 changed company
reporting requirements in relation to financial years beginning on or after 1 January
2019. Large companies are required to include a statement in their strategic report
explaining how directors have met their duties under section 172 of the Companies
Act 2006 to promote the success of the company. Section 172 requires directors to
have regard, amongst other matters, to the impact of the company’s operations on
the community and the environment.
FRC guidelines on board
effectiveness
The Financial Reporting Council regulates auditors, accountants and actuaries in the
UK. It also sets the UK’s corporate governance and stewardship codes. Its Guidance
on Board Effectiveness notes that boards may wish to use a voluntary framework
to help identify the ESG factors that are relevant for their business and link them to
company strategy.
Proposed FRC revisions to UK
Stewardship Code
The Financial Reporting Council has consulted on revisions to the UK Stewardship
Code due in Summer 2019. Compliance with the Stewardship Code is voluntary,
but on a “comply or explain” basis for UK regulated firms. The proposed
amendments include a requirement to take ESG factors into account when fulfilling
stewardship responsibilities.
Requirements for pension trustee
statements of investment principles
New regulations come into force in October 2019 requiring pension trustees
to document how they have considered ESG factors and their policy towards
stewardship in their statements of investment principles.

The design of foundation for bridges over water is a challenging and tedious task and the designer would encounter extreme problems.
The most crucial factor that may control the design of bridges over water is environmental conditions rather than ground condition unlike the design of bridge foundation on land which govern by ground condition.
Therefore, it is considerably significant to understand the environmental conditions that govern over water bridge design and specify their influence on the selection of foundation types and their construction methods.

Effect of Environmental Conditions on Foundations for Bridges
Environmental factors that affect the selection of over water foundation types and their construction methods are discussed below:
- Exposure conditions and water depths
- Sea or river current
- Ship collision
- Floating ice
- Earthquakes
Exposure Conditions and Water Depths of Bridge Foundations
When bridge structure is constructed in open waters of broad bay crossing, it is commonly exposed to strong currents and wind. This aggressive condition leads to undesired influences, such as, deteriorating uncompleted structure and restricting the operation period of floating construction plant.
This undesired condition encourages the utilization of sizable prefabricated structural members. For example, open well caissons and box caissons. The caisson units are commonly floated and transported to the bridge construction site. After that, they are submerged and placed on the prepared bed or piles.
Fig.2: Open Caisson Sunk on Prepared Bed
Box caisson can be employed for the case where sea water is sufficiently deep for box caisson floatation. Weather condition plays significant role during transportation of the caisson box to the bridge construction site, sinking and installation of caisson units. So, it is necessary to consider possible delay in construction due to poor weather condition into account.
As far as open well caisson is concerned, it is suitable for shallow water in which shallow draft bottom section is floated and moved to the construction site and submerged by taking out the soil from the open wells while the walls are lifted gradually.
It is worth mentioning that the construction process of open well caisson is more sensible to the effect of weather conditions compared to the installation process of box caisson units. The box caisson construction can be carried out in considerably short period of time unless poor weather condition halt installation operation.
Effect of Sea or River Current on Bridge Foundation
Piles or piers may be subjected to drag force which is generated by sea or river current. This force creates scour holes in locations where the soil is vulnerable to erosion at sea bed level.
The presence of these holes around cofferdams are undesired since it generates circular movement of water in this location because of temporary conditions such as partially driven sheet piles.
Current drag force is likely to create issues while sheet piles or bearing piles are installed. This is because such force at high velocities oscillates and consequently damages the pile prior to placement of pile caps or temporary grit provision which prevents the pile oscillations.
Effect of Ship Collision on Bridge Foundation
Collisions are likely to occur due to ships, which are out of control and possibly cause bridge pier failure. In specific broad estuaries, deep water channel may swing from one side to another in a considerably short time and almost all piers of the constructed bridge would be at risk.
The collapse of the old Sunshine Skyway Bridge in 1980 due to collision of a vessel with one of the piers of the bridge is a realistic example of ship collision risk.
Fig.3: Collapse of the Old Sunshine Skyway Bridge
Fig.4: Failure of old Sunshine Skyway Bridge in 1980 due to collision of a vessel with one of the piers of the bridge
So, it is necessary to take necessary measures to prevent the danger of ship collision to piers. These precautions would certainly increase the total cost of foundation construction.
Examples of precautions against ship collision include providing artificial island around the pier to stop vessel prior to collide with bridge pier. This protection measure should be considered for piers in shallow water.
Fig.5: Penang Island Bridge Piers are Protected from Ship Collision by Providing Artificial Island
Fig.6: Details of Artificial Island Surrounding Bridge Piers to Protect the Pier Against Ship Collision
If artificial islands are constructed in deep water, the amount of stones used for wave protection and mattresses employed against scouring would be inevitably large and it would create problems for water navigation.
Another protection measure is the provision of fender piles which are commonly connected by large ring beam. The ring beams should be distant from the pier to permit pier deflection while they swallow kinetic energy of moving vessel and make it to stop.
Fig.7: Provision of short piles around piers as a protection consideration against ship collision, Sunshine Skyway Bridge
Fig.8: Protecting Pier Bridge Against Ship Collision
Effects of Floating Ice on Bridge Foundations
There is a similarity between the effect of floating ice sheet impact and collision ship influence on the bridge pier. So, their design is also similar to each other. However, there is an extra danger in the former case which is the gradual increase of pressure due to the amassing of ice packs.
The direction of build up pressure is transvers to the bridge pier or vertical when pressure ridges start to form. It is recommended to use single pier bridge rather than group piles because single piles will alter the direction of ice floes and prevent ridge pressure formation.
For gravity base structure, the best form of bridge foundation in areas subjected to floating ice is the application of slender piers with a massive base. This is because the latter would provide resistance against sliding and overturning forces whereas the former does not create much resistance against floating ice sheet force.
Moreover, if the utilization of piles are needed due to ground conditions, then a ring of closely spaced skirt piles should be installed around the group pile.
Finally, for the case the movement of water is parallel to the river bank, the introduction of cut waters to the piles would provide satisfactory answer to the floating ice forces. This is because cutwaters would cut and break ice floes and consequently avoid the impact and pressure of floating ice sheets.
Effect of Earthquakes on Bridge Foundations
Earthquakes impose devastation force on the bridge piers especially in deep water because the force exerted on the bridge superstructure would be combined with the load on the pier and consequently substantial overturning moment at the base of the pier will be produced. The mass of water replaced by pier is specified to be added to the mass of the pier.
The eccentric load supported by the pier is crucially large in deep water which makes the selection of slender pier and massive base a desirable option. It is recommended to use circular column because seismic forces do not have particular direction and it can be in any direction.
Another problem is the liquefaction of loose to medium dense soil due to ground shaking. This issue may be tackled by using pile foundation to densify the soil to an extent that can support piers safely. The depth of liquefaction may be computed using particle size distribution and in situ density.
Finally, liquefaction may cause tsunami or develop submarine flow slides and subsequently a horizontal force at the base of the pier will be generated.

The basic need of human beings are food, cloth and shelter.i.e (Home). The meaning of home is not simply constructing four walls and slab over it but it will provides comfort, healthy climate, aesthetic beauty and living standards to users.
All these requirements are fulfilled by a new concept i.e. ‘GREEN BUILDING’.
Green Buildings helps in:
1. Increasing efficiency with which building and their site use, water and materials etc.
2. Reducing building impact on human health and environment through better site planning, design, operation, and maintenance till its life period.
Today’s pollution is tremendously increasing and it has ill effect on human being as well as environment. Day by day harmony between human being and environment get reduces. By using green concept in our building planning ecological balance between human and environment will be achieved.
Fig: Components of Green Buildings
Initially green building cost 3-8% more than conventional building however higher initial cost is compensated within 2-3 years by handsome saving in its maintenance cost making green concept extremely popular. Thus total life cycle cost is much lower than conventional building.
The Indian Green Building Council (IGBC), a part of the confederation of Indian Industry-Sohrabji Godrej Green Business Centre (CII-Godrej GBC), Hyderabad, is credited with spreading the green building movement in India since 2001. The CII-Godrej GBC was India’s first certified platinum rated green building spread over 20,000 sq.ft in Hyderabad.
Today there are 315 green buildings in India, including 250 commercial which include IT parks, hospitals, airports and educational institutions. Of these 315, as many as 60 green buildings-or nearly 20 percent – have come up in Mumbai alone. The remaining are in other states of India. Starting with a modest 20,000 sq.ft green building in 2004 in Hyderabad, green buildings today account for over 235 million sq.ft. spread across India. . Concrete has a substantial environmental impact. Various methods to reduce environmental impact of concrete such as material conservation is discussed.
For example, it is estimated that 1.6 billion ton of concrete is produced annually which is responsible for about 7% carbon dioxide in addition to depletion of natural sources and dumping considerable volume of waste material.
Concrete is made of three major materials includes cement, aggregate, and water. Concrete production need huge energy consumption and release large amount of green house emission.
Utilization of aggregate and water lead to decrease natural resources and probably lead to water contamination. Additionally, there are various materials which are used as admixture to improve concrete properties and these admixtures may cause detrimental environmental impact.
Finally, lack of highly durable material is another source of concrete environmental issue and concrete is commonly designed for service life of 50 years.
If concrete durability were higher, its environmental impact would be lesser for instance the rate of using natural resources would be smaller. There are number of ways by which the environmental impact of concrete may be decreased and this article will shed light on these techniques.

Methods to Reduce Environmental Impact of Concrete
Following are the various methods which can considered to reduce the environmental impact of concrete:
- Cement conservation
- Aggregate conservation
- Water conservation
- Concrete durability
Cement Conservation to Reduce Environmental Impact of Concrete
The conservation of cement is the first and most important step in decreasing both energy utilization and greenhouse gas emission. Resource productivity consideration stipulates the deduction of the utilization of Portland cement while meeting the future demands for more concrete. This needs to be the first agenda of successful concrete industry.
The use of Portland cement containing pozzolanic materials for example ground granulated blast furnace slag, fly ash, and silica fume is increasing considerably. However, these by product admixture which are used as cement replacement material are employed in minor or low value applications for instance landfills and road sub-bases.
The use of cement in structural applications can be decreased by using by product cementitious or pozzolanic material as a cement replacement. This leads to decrease the demand for cement production.
It is reported that, replacing cement with slag or fly ash by 50% will provide better durable product compare with that of Portland cement with zero replacement and consequently natural resource application is decreased.
Furthermore, the setting and hardening of concrete containing large percent of cementitious material is low but this can be tackled to a certain extent by using superplasticizer.
It is possible that slow pace construction process be approved in the future when resource maximization is become the most important industry purpose instead of labor productivity.
Aggregate Conservation to Reduce Environmental Impact of Concrete
It is claimed that in North America, Japan, and Europe, around two thirds of construction and demolition waste are composed of old broken concrete and masonry. If these waste materials are reused as a coarse aggregate, material productivity will improve greatly.
Moreover, dredge sand and mining waste which are present in number of countries around the world, can be processed and applied as fine aggregate. Even though the processing of these waste material require a budget but it can be considerably economical particularly in those countries where the cost of damping waste material is substantial and land is rare.
So significant is the recycling and reusing waste material that solve natural resource depletion problem in many regions and avoid high cost of transporting virgin aggregate over long distances.
It is claimed by Lauritzen that, 1 billion tons of concrete and masonry rubble are produced per year and small amount of concrete and masonry waste are reused again.
Expensive waste disposal and environmental considerations have motivated the majority of European country to set short term goals to recycle between 50 to 90% of demolition and construction waste.
Lastly, recycled aggregate in general and specifically masonry aggregate possess large porosity compare with natural aggregate. So, for the same workability, water demand to produce fresh concrete is higher compare the case of using natural aggregate and the mechanical properties of hardened concrete are influenced detrimentally. To tackle this problem, combination of natural and recycle aggregate may be used or fly ash and water reducing admixture can be employed in concrete.
Water Conservation to Reduce Environmental Impact of Concrete
It is reported by Hawken et al that, the availability of fresh and clean water decreases continuously and only 3% of all water on earth are fresh water which most of it either located deep beneath earth surface of trapped fast melting glaciers.
As a result of increasing industrial, agricultural, and urban demand for water, water table is lowering in addition to the increase of water contamination.
It is recommended that, the only practical and reasonable solution to this problem is the utilization of available resources more efficiently.
Concrete producers consume water in large scale and these producers and other fresh large consumers should be forced to use water efficiently. It is estimated that 100L/m3 is used to clean ready mix trucks and large amount of water is employed for mixing.
It is believed that, 1 trillion L of water is used for mixing annually and this huge quantity can be decreased to half by the increase of mineral admixture and superplasticizer application and better grading of aggregate.
Moreover, with the approval of test results, the use of brackish water and industrial recycled water must be enforced instead of clean water, and this must be entirely imperative in the case of washing equipments.
Furthermore, it is reported that considerable amount of water saved when retarder used for fresh returned concrete.
Finally, during concrete curing, the application of textile, which has exterior impermeable membrane and water absorbent fabric at interior face, cut water utilization.
Concrete Durability to Reduce Environmental Impact of Concrete
In addition to those measures discussed in the above sections, enhancing concrete durability offer long term solution and exceptional breakthrough for improving productivity of concrete industry and hence decrease environmental impact on concrete production, for instance if concrete structure is constructed for a service life of 500 year rather than 50 year, the resource productivity of concrete industry will increased by factor of 10.
The durability of modern structures is questionable because deterioration begins after around 20 years whereas there are buildings and seawalls constructed from unreinforced roman concrete which maintain their good condition after nearly 2000 years. This might mainly because of considerably crack prone Portland cement concrete which consequently became permeable during its service life.
Moreover, steel reinforcement in permeable concrete corrodes and leads to progressive damage of the structure.
In modern times, construction practice is controlled by culture of accelerating construction speed in which large amount of high early strength Portland cement is employed. Consequently, weak crack resistance concrete structure is constructed because of large drying shrinkage and thermal contraction and small creep relaxation.
Furthermore, roman concrete made with mixture of volcanic ash and hydrated lime, and created homogenous hydrated product that set and hardened in a slow pace however better than hydrated Portland cement product thermodynamically. Added to that, less amount of water used in the roman concrete and were not subjected to cracks at the same degree as Portland cement concrete.
Therefore, if concrete durability is major concern or purpose, producing less crack-prone concrete rather than high speed construction should be focused on and hence construction practice need to undergo paradigm change toward that direction.
It is demonstrated that, entire of most of cracking and shrinkage in concrete can be prevented and consequently high durable concrete can be produced provided that water to cementitious material in concrete is deduced through superplasticizer application.
A large free crack monolithic concrete foundation of a temple that is in Kauai which is an island in Pacific Ocean is described by Mehta and Langley. The foundation made of two parallel of unreinforced concrete slab.
To produce concrete with considerably small shrinkage stresses, it was necessary to decrease to limit both thermal and drying shrinkage through substantial reduction of Portland cement and water in concrete.
Slump of concrete used for the foundation was 125±25 mm and its compressive strength after 90 day was 20 MPa with 13 C rise of temperature. The exposed surface of the foundation was carefully and properly examine after almost two year and there was no any crack evidence.
Investigation on the core samples taken from the slab demonstrated that, not only did the homogeneity of the hydration product of high fly ash system were better compare with conventional concrete but also the bond between aggregate and hydration product was very well. This is a precondition for achieving crack resistant and high durable concrete.
Figure 2 shows thin section of core sample taken from the slab and neither interfacial zone of micro-cracking are shown between coarse aggregate and adjacent cement mortar.
In contrary, Figure 3 illustrates the how interfacial aggregate-paste micro-cracks connect and allow the ingression of fluid from outside
Finally, the mixture proportion employed to produce concrete in the construction of foundation of the temple in Kauai are shown in Table-1.

It primarily uses 60 percent of the world’s natural resources directly or indirectly as construction materials for developing buildings and infrastructure. The issues that develop after having these vast concrete jungles are even more appalling.
The strong influence of the construction industry on sustainable development has brought authorities to develop sustainable development objectives. The severity of the problem is better understood by knowing the top sustainability issues for which the construction industry is responsible.
This article explains the top 7 sustainability issues and their connection with the construction industry.

- Frequently Asked Questions
1. Global warming due to Construction
Global warming is the process of an increase in global temperatures due to the rise in the amount of carbon-di-oxide and other greenhouse gases.
The burning of fossil fuels for energy production generates a large amount of carbon-di-oxide. This energy is consumed for different phases of the construction life cycle. The manufacture of concrete also has resulted in around 2.8 billion tonnes of CO2 that is expected to rise in the coming years.
Also Read: Sustainable Concrete Construction Methods and Practices
The greenhouse gases or GHG emitted from extraction, manufacture, transportation, installation, utilization, maintenance, and disposal of the construction materials is another main contributor to global warming. Global warming results in extreme weather conditions and natural disasters.
2. Loss of Biodiversity and Natural Habitats
The land consumption for the construction of structures or extraction of natural resources results in the loss of biodiversity and habitats. It hence results in the loss of species and their extinction. Biodiversity and natural habitats are essential elements that maintain the balance of the ecosystem.
3. Acidification due to Construction
The process of fossil fuel combustion conducted for the manufacture and transportation of construction materials emits a large amount of sulfur and nitrogen compounds. These compounds, if not correctly disposed, can dissolve in water bodies. Their solid forms also can remain in surface waters or the soils. This acidification is the primary cause of acid rain in the environment.
4. Air Pollution due to Construction
The construction industry results in airborne particles that have a size range of less than 10micrometres in diameters. These particles are hence invisible. Airborne particles, both in liquid and solid forms, cause harm to the environment and humans.
Most of the airborne particles are emitted due to construction and extraction activities such as mining of aggregate, operation of construction equipment, production of electricity, manufacturing process, and transportation of materials.
5. Toxicity due to Construction
Toxicity increases in the atmosphere with the presence of heavy metals. The presence of heavy metals in the water when it exceeds undesirable limits brings health issues to living. Manufacturing and transportation of construction materials are the major contributors to toxic metals.
6. Water Resource Pollution due to Construction
The pollution of water resources by impermeable and non-degradable construction materials reduces the ability to perform groundwater recharge. The depletion and pollution of water resources make the hydrological cycle to alter drastically.
Water is depleted by consuming it in large amounts for construction activities and extraction processes. The pollutants and by-products after construction activities are sent back to water bodies as a form of disposal. It hence pollutes the water bodies.
7. Deforestation due to Construction
Construction demands a large land area. This forces humans to takeover forest resources. With an increase in urbanization, this demand keeps on increasing. The depletion of forest land, trees for construction activities are still an increasing trend. These forests have the power to hold more than half of the world’s biodiversity, and hence it is essential to maintain it.
Understanding the risks that construction creates for the environment is the first step towards tackling this issue. Sustainable construction methods are emerging each year to address this situation.
Frequently Asked Questions
The construction industry demands 60% of the natural resources. This is utilized for the manufacture of products and construction activities. As a result of which it causes the following sustainability issues:
Depletion of Natural Resources, diversity, and habitats.
Manufacture of products results in the emission of pollutants and gases to the atmosphere.
Pollutants in air results in acid rain and airborne diseases
Improper disposal of construction waste results in water pollution, which results in a decrease in groundwater discharge.
Air pollutants are formed due to the construction activities like manufacture and extraction activities such as mining of aggregate, operation of equipment, production of electricity, manufacturing process, and transportation of materials.
The major causes of toxicity in the environment are the presence of heavy metals. The main contributors to heavy metals are the manufacturing and transportation of construction products.
The carbon-di-oxide amount in the atmosphere is primarily due to the manufacture of concrete structures. The combustion of fossil fuels to generate energy also results in the emission of carbon-di-oxide in large amounts.

What is sustainability in construction and civil engineering?
Sustainability is defined the desire to perform activities without any depletion of resources or bringing any harmful effect on the environment. Practicing sustainable construction methods will help avoiding harmful effects from construction activities.
Construction involves activities like use of building materials from various sources, use of machineries, demolition of existing structures, use of green fields, cutting down of tress etc. which can impact environment in one or more ways. Civil engineering field being the major part of the economy, it is very essential that sustainable construction practice dominate the past followed conventional construction practice and methods.
Need for Sustainable Construction
Construction has a direct impact on the environment due to following reasons:
- Generation of waste materials
- Emissions from vehicles, machineries
- Noise pollution due to use of heavy vehicles and construction machineries.
- Releases of wastes and pollutants into water, ground and atmosphere.
Sustainability assessment of construction projects is essential to the fact that it does not create any harmful effects on the living ecosystem while optimizing the cost of construction. This is to ensure the availability of resources for the future generations.
How to Ensure Sustainable Construction?
In order to support sustainability in the field of construction, the building and the built environment have to satisfy some of the important criteria. This will include:
- Biodiversity Enhancement
- Support to the Community
- Effective Use of Resources
- Pollution Reduction
- Creating Healthy Environment
- Process Management
1. Biodiversity Enhancement
Sustainable Construction must stop threatening use of environment or species wherever possible so that the natural habitat is not affected.
2. Support to the Community
Support and help should reach to the real need, aspirations and real requirements. Also involve the needed in the key decisions.
3. Effective use of resources
Overconsumption of disappropriate amount of resources like land, money, use or disposal, construction must be stopped. Wastage of resources, materials, water, poor design is not recommended. The building constructed have to be affordable and manageable.
Sand and Gravel are being used for thousands of years in construction. The demand for these is increasing day by day as demand for infrastructure development is increasing.
Over use of construction materials such river sand and gravels also have negative impact on environment. Excessive sand-and-gravel mining causes the degradation of rivers. Sand mining results in the lowering of the stream bottom, that results in bank erosion. This results in the destruction of aquatic and riparian habitat through large changes in the channel morphology. The harmful effects include bed degradation, lowered water tables and channel instability.
There are many harmful impacts of using river sand and mining of gravels and a detailed study is required to list all the negative impacts. The use of alternate building materials can reduce the impact of this on environment.
The alternate to river sand is Manufactured Sand (M-Sand) which can be used in construction works reduce impacts of mining river sand.
Read article on: Manufactured Sand (M-Sand)
4. Pollution Reduction
Less dependency on pollution causing products and materials, transports, power and energy are encouraged.
Annually billions of tons of demolition waste are generated worldwide for the need for new construction activities. Improper disposal of these waste tend to be hazardous to the environment. Below mentioned are some of the methods to make the construction waste sustainable:
- Elimination of production of construction waste
- Reduction of amount of construction waste
- Reuse construction wastes in other works.
- Recover (recycling, composting, energy) – recycle what you can only after you have reused it.
- Dispose what is left in a responsible way.
Use of durable construction materials and quality control at site for durability of structure is one step towards minimization of construction waste generation.
5. Creating Healthy Environment
Instead of endangering the health of worker, builders and occupants’ construction must enhance leisure, living and the working environments.
Around 40% of total energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions are directly due to construction and operation of buildings. The best of to reduce this impact is the use of green buildings construction techniques.

6. Process Management
Too many aspirations for a project will won’t give sustainable construction. Hence, identification of appropriate targets, benchmarks and tools along with their proper management will give sustainability in construction. . ",False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False
naturegoingsmart,https://naturegoingsmart.com/fish-farming-environment/ ,"Fish farming: how does it affect the environment?
Do you know where the fish you eat comes from?
It is viewed that eating fish is more ecological than eating meat;
however this can be seriously questioned as we learn about Aquaculture practices.
What is Aquaculture?
Just as Agriculture is the domestication of land (plants and animals), Aquaculture is the domestication of the ocean.
Why are we fish farming?
Our consumption of fish have outstripped the natural capacity of freshwater and marine fisheries. These can no longer provide enough supply. Fisheries are now considered to be fully or over-exploited (1). Therefore, Aquaculture provides an increasing proportion of fish supply and this will continue to rise.
How does it impact on the environment?
Intensive Aquaculture operations are held near freshwater streams, in the sea or on the coast. These practices are chemically and genetically destructive (2).
Challenge
Cause
Consequences
Waste
1. Fish faeces & feed: production of sediments.
2. Ammonium excretion
- Particles settle downstream producing a muddy deoxygentated substrate (5)(6)
2. Ammonia=toxic and uses oxygen during oxidation to nitrate-> oxygen depletion
Oxygen depletion
Aquaculture uses on average, more than one tonne of O2 to produce one tonne of fish (6).
Harms organisms around the fish farms, leading to destruction of ecosystems.
Genetic pollution
Domesticated fish adapt to captivity (making ‘weak’ genes, or non-adapted to the wild), as many escapes occur, these fish mate with the wild ones, risking of spreading their ‘weak’ genes (3).
Causes further stress on fragile species and increases their risk of extinction
Antibiotic resistance
Intensive farming means increase risk of diseases. To treat these, fishes are given antibiotics (6).
Release of antibiotics into the environment-> harms sensitive species + increases the rate of evolution of resistant bacteria (6).
Diseases
The risk of diseases increases in fish farms, infestation of diseases put at risk nearby species at risk of also being infected (4).
Harms sensitive species
Considering all the pollutants the ocean contains, is eating fish healthy?
A study looking at the concentration of organochlorine contaminants in salmons found that these were higher in farmed salmon than in the wild ones. Furthermore, it was found that European-raised salmon had significantly greater contaminant loads than fish farmed in North and South America.
The conclusion made by this study was that the consumption of farmed Atlantic salmon may pose health risks that outweigh the beneficial effect of fish consumption (7).
Conclusions
Intensive Aquaculture is very harmful to the environment and in addition fish accumulates many contaminants that are present in the sea. Therefore it is questionable whether consuming it is worth its beneficial effect.
Decreasing fish consumption and favoring organic farmed fish which is less intensive and does not use antibiotics is an ethical option, or you can check out our recipes and guidebooks and get inspired to live a plant-based diet!
You are informed, you, as a consumer, guide the direction the big industries take.
Consume better and less that is the mantra!

26th March 1986;
CONVINCED that further international action to prevent and eliminate pollution of the sea should be taken
without delay, as part of progressive and coherent measures to protect the marine environment;
RECOGNISING that it may be desirable to adopt, on the regional level, more stringent measures with
respect to the prevention and elimination of pollution of the marine environment or with respect to the
protection of the marine environment against the adverse effects of human activities than are provided for in
international conventions or agreements with a global scope;
RECOGNISING that questions relating to the management of fisheries are appropriately regulated under
international and regional agreements dealing specifically with such questions;
CONSIDERING that the present Oslo and Paris Conventions do not adequately control some of the many
sources of pollution, and that it is therefore justifiable to replace them with the present Convention, which
addresses all sources of pollution of the marine environment and the adverse effects of human activities upon
it, takes into account the precautionary principle and strengthens regional cooperation;
HAVE AGREED as follows:

places and methods of dumping.
ARTICLE 5
No placement of matter in the maritime area for a purpose other than that for which it was originally
designed or constructed shall take place without authorisation or regulation by the competent authority of the
relevant Contracting Party. Such authorisation or regulation shall be in accordance with the relevant
applicable criteria, guidelines and procedures adopted by the Commission in accordance with Article 6 of
this Annex. This provision shall not be taken to permit the dumping of wastes or other matter otherwise
prohibited under this Annex.
ARTICLE 6
For the purposes of this Annex, it shall, inter alia, be the duty of the Commission to draw up and adopt
criteria, guidelines and procedures relating to the dumping of wastes or other matter listed in paragraph 2 of
Article 3, and to the placement of matter referred to in Article 5, of this Annex, with a view to preventing
and eliminating pollution.
ARTICLE 7
The provisions of this Annex concerning dumping shall not apply in case of force majeure, due to stress of
weather or any other cause, when the safety of human life or of a vessel or aircraft is threatened. Such
dumping shall be so conducted as to minimise the likelihood of damage to human or marine life and shall
immediately be reported to the Commission, together with full details of the circumstances and of the nature
and quantities of the wastes or other matter dumped.
ARTICLE 8
The Contracting Parties shall take appropriate measures, both individually and within relevant international
organisations, to prevent and eliminate pollution resulting from the abandonment of vessels or aircraft in the
maritime area caused by accidents. In the absence of relevant guidance from such international organisations,
the measures taken by individual Contracting Parties should be based on such guidelines as the Commission
may adopt.
ARTICLE 9
In an emergency, if a Contracting Party considers that wastes or other matter the dumping of which is
prohibited under this Annex cannot be disposed of on land without unacceptable danger or damage, it shall
forthwith consult other Contracting Parties with a view to finding the most satisfactory methods of storage or
the most satisfactory means of destruction or disposal under the prevailing circumstances. The Contracting
Party shall inform the Commission of the steps adopted following this consultation. The Contracting Parties
pledge themselves to assist one another in such situations.
ARTICLE 10
1. Each Contracting Party shall ensure compliance with the provisions of this Annex:
(a) by vessels or aircraft registered in its territory;
(b) by vessels or aircraft loading in its territory the wastes or other matter which are to be dumped
or incinerated;
(c) by vessels or aircraft believed to be engaged in dumping or incineration within its internal
waters or within its territorial sea or within that part of the sea beyond and adjacent to the
territorial sea under the jurisdiction of the coastal state to the extent recognised by international
law.
2. Each Contracting Party shall issue instructions to its maritime inspection vessels and aircraft and to
other appropriate services to report to its authorities any incidents or conditions in the maritime area which
give rise to suspicions that dumping in contravention of the provisions of the present Annex has occurred or
is about to occur. Any Contracting Party whose authorities receive such a report shall, if it considers it
appropriate, accordingly inform any other Contracting Party concerned.
3. Nothing in this Annex shall abridge the sovereign immunity to which certain vessels are entitled under
international law.
2 Sub-paragraph (f) was introduced by amendment to the Annex agreed by OSPAR 2007. The amendment will enter into force
for those Contracting Parties which have ratified, accepted or approved it on the thirtieth day after receipt by the Depositary
Government of notification of its ratification, acceptance or approval by at least seven Contracting Parties. Thereafter the
amendment will enter into force for any other Contracting Party on the thirtieth day after that Contracting Party has
deposited its instrument of ratification, acceptance or approval of the amendment.
3 After the entry into force of OSPAR Decision 98/2 on Dumping of Radioactive Waste on 9 February 1999, subparagraphs
(b) and (c) of this paragraph ceased to have effect.

ANNEX V ON THE PROTECTION AND CONSERVATION OF ECOSYSTEMS AND BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY OF THE MARITIME AREA
5, 6, 7
ARTICLE 1
For the purposes of this Annex and of Appendix 3 the definitions of “biological diversity”, “ecosystem” and
“habitat” are those contained in the Convention on Biological Diversity of 5 June 1992.
ARTICLE 2
In fulfilling their obligation under the Convention to take, individually and jointly, the necessary measures to
protect the maritime area against the adverse effects of human activities so as to safeguard human health and
to conserve marine ecosystems and, when practicable, restore marine areas which have been adversely
affected, as well as their obligation under the Convention on Biological Diversity of 5 June 1992 to develop
strategies, plans or programmes for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity, Contracting
Parties shall:
a. take the necessary measures to protect and conserve the ecosystems and the biological diversity
of the maritime area, and to restore, where practicable, marine areas which have been adversely
affected; and
b. cooperate in adopting programmes and measures for those purposes for the control of the human
activities identified by the application of the criteria in Appendix 3.
ARTICLE 3
1. For the purposes of this Annex, it shall inter alia be the duty of the Commission:
a. to draw up programmes and measures for the control of the human activities identified by the
application of the criteria in Appendix 3;
b. in doing so:
(i) to collect and review information on such activities and their effects on ecosystems and
biological diversity;
(ii) to develop means, consistent with international law, for instituting protective,
conservation, restorative or precautionary measures related to specific areas or sites or
related to particular species or habitats;
(iii) subject to Article 4 of this Annex, to consider aspects of national strategies and guidelines
on the sustainable use of components of biological diversity of the maritime area as they
affect the various regions and sub-regions of that area;
(iv) subject to Article 4 of this Annex, to aim for the application of an integrated ecosystem
approach.
c. also in doing so, to take account of programmes and measures adopted by Contracting Parties
for the protection and conservation of ecosystems within waters under their sovereignty or
jurisdiction.
2. In the adoption of such programmes and measures, due consideration shall be given to the question
whether any particular programme or measure should apply to all, or a specified part, of the maritime area.
ARTICLE 4
1. In accordance with the penultimate recital of the Convention, no programme or measure concerning a
question relating to the management of fisheries shall be adopted under this Annex. However where the
Commission considers that action is desirable in relation to such a question, it shall draw that question to the
attention of the authority or international body competent for that question. Where action within the
competence of the Commission is desirable to complement or support action by those authorities or bodies,
the Commission shall endeavour to cooperate with them.
2. Where the Commission considers that action under this Annex is desirable in relation to a question
concerning maritime transport, it shall draw that question to the attention of the International Maritime
Organisation. The Contracting Parties who are members of the International Maritime Organisation shall
endeavour to cooperate within that Organisation in order to achieve an appropriate response, including in
relevant cases that Organisation’s agreement to regional or local action, taking account of any guidelines
developed by that Organisation on the designation of special areas, the identification of particularly sensitive
areas or other matters.
5 On the adoption of the new Annex V in 1998, Ministers also reached agreement on the meaning of certain concepts given in this new Annex V (see OSPAR Agreement 1998-15.2)
6 In accordance with Article 15.5 of the Convention, Annex V and Appendix 3 has entered into force:
on 30 August 2000 for Finland, Spain, Switzerland, Luxembourg, European Community, United Kingdom and
Denmark;
on 5 October 2000 for Sweden;
on 18 July 2001 for Iceland;

on 25 March 2006 for Portugal.
7 In a Note Verbale dated 26 July 2005, the Embassy of Great Britain in Paris informed the French Government
that the British government wished to extend the ratification of Annex V and Appendix 3 to the Isle of Man.
APPENDIX 1 CRITERIA FOR THE DEFINITION OF PRACTICES AND TECHNIQUES MENTIONED IN PARAGRAPH 3(B)(I) OF ARTICLE 2 OF THE CONVENTION
BEST AVAILABLE TECHNIQUES
1. The use of the best available techniques shall emphasise the use of non-waste technology, if available.
2. The term ""best available techniques"" means the latest stage of development (state of the art) of
processes, of facilities or of methods of operation which indicate the practical suitability of a particular
measure for limiting discharges, emissions and waste. In determining whether a set of processes, facilities
and methods of operation constitute the best available techniques in general or individual cases, special
consideration shall be given to:
(a) comparable processes, facilities or methods of operation which have recently been successfully
tried out;
(b) technological advances and changes in scientific knowledge and understanding;
(c) the economic feasibility of such techniques;
(d) time limits for installation in both new and existing plants;
(e) the nature and volume of the discharges and emissions concerned.
3. It therefore follows that what is ""best available techniques"" for a particular process will change with
time in the light of technological advances, economic and social factors, as well as changes in scientific
knowledge and understanding.
4. If the reduction of discharges and emissions resulting from the use of best available techniques does
not lead to environmentally acceptable results, additional measures have to be applied.
5. ""Techniques"" include both the technology used and the way in which the installation is designed, built,
maintained, operated and dismantled.
BEST ENVIRONMENTAL PRACTICE
6. The term ""best environmental practice"" means the application of the most appropriate combination of
environmental control measures and strategies. In making a selection for individual cases, at least the
following graduated range of measures should be considered:
(a) the provision of information and education to the public and to users about the environmental
consequences of choice of particular activities and choice of products, their use and ultimate
disposal;
(b) the development and application of codes of good environmental practice which covers all
aspect of the activity in the product's life;
(c) the mandatory application of labels informing users of environmental risks related to a product,
its use and ultimate disposal;
(d) saving resources, including energy;
(e) making collection and disposal systems available to the public;
(f) avoiding the use of hazardous substances or products and the generation of hazardous waste;
(g) recycling, recovery and re-use;
(h) the application of economic instruments to activities, products or groups of products;
(i) establishing a system of licensing, involving a range of restrictions or a ban.
7. In determining what combination of measures constitute best environmental practice, in general or
individual cases, particular consideration should be given to:
(a) the environmental hazard of the product and its production, use and ultimate disposal;
(b) the substitution by less polluting activities or substances;
(c) the scale of use;
(d) the potential environmental benefit or penalty of substitute materials or activities;
(e) advances and changes in scientific knowledge and understanding;
(f) time limits for implementation;
(g) social and economic implications.
8. It therefore follows that best environmental practice for a particular source will change with time in
the light of technological advances, economic and social factors, as well as changes in scientific knowledge
and understanding.
9. If the reduction of inputs resulting from the use of best environmental practice does not lead to
environmentally acceptable results, additional measures have to be applied and best environmental practice
redefined.
APPENDIX 2 CRITERIA MENTIONED IN PARAGRAPH 2 OF ARTICLE 1 OF ANNEX I AND IN PARAGRAPH 2 OF ARTICLE 2 OF ANNEX III
1. When setting priorities and in assessing the nature and extent of the programmes and measures and
their time scales, the Contracting Parties shall use the criteria given below:
(a) persistency;
(b) toxicity or other noxious properties;
(c) tendency to bioaccumulation;
(d) radioactivity;
(e) the ratio between observed or (where the results of observations are not yet available) predicted
concentrations and no observed effect concentrations;
(f) anthropogenically caused risk of eutrophication;
(g) transboundary significance;
(h) risk of undesirable changes in the marine ecosystem and irreversibility or durability of effects;
(i) interference with harvesting of sea-foods or with other legitimate uses of the sea;
(j) effects on the taste and/or smell of products for human consumption from the sea, or effects on
smell, colour, transparency or other characteristics of the water in the marine environment;
(k) distribution pattern (i.e., quantities involved, use pattern and liability to reach the marine
environment);
(l) non-fulfilment of environmental quality objectives.
2. These criteria are not necessarily of equal importance for the consideration of a particular substance or
group of substances.
3. The above criteria indicate that substances which shall be subject to programmes and measures
include:
(a) heavy metals and their compounds;
(b) organohalogen compounds (and substances which may form such compounds in the marine
environment);
(c) organic compounds of phosphorus and silicon;
(d) biocides such as pesticides, fungicides, herbicides, insecticides, slimicides and chemicals used,
inter alia, for the preservation of wood, timber, wood pulp, cellulose, paper, hides and textiles;
(e) oils and hydrocarbons of petroleum origin;
(f) nitrogen and phosphorus compounds;
(g) radioactive substances, including wastes;
(h) persistent synthetic materials which may float, remain in suspension or sink.
APPENDIX 3 CRITERIA FOR IDENTIFYING HUMAN ACTIVITIES FOR THE PURPOSE OF ANNEX V
1. The criteria to be used, taking into account regional differences, for identifying human activities for
the purposes of Annex V are:
a. the extent, intensity and duration of the human activity under consideration;
b. actual and potential adverse effects of the human activity on specific species, communities and
habitats;
c. actual and potential adverse effects of the human activity on specific ecological processes;
d. irreversibility or durability of these effects.
2. These criteria are not necessarily exhaustive or of equal importance for the consideration of a
particular activity.

billygraham,https://billygraham.org/story/billy-grahams-my-answer-global-warming-and-the-environment/ ,"Earth Day is one of many opportunities environmentalists take to bring light to renewable energy, recycling and other ways to “go green.” But should Christians be concerned about taking care of our planet? Here’s an answer from Billy Graham.
Q: I’ve always been concerned about the environment, and my concern has grown in recent years with all the talk about global warming and the need for alternative energy sources and things like that. Why don’t churches say more about this?
In reality, many churches and mission groups are speaking out about these issues. A number of denominations, for example, have passed resolutions urging their members to be more active in environmental issues.
Why should we be concerned about the environment? It isn’t just because of the dangers we face from pollution, climate change, or other environmental problems—although these are serious. For Christians, the issue is much deeper: We know that God created the world, and it belongs to Him, not us. Because of this, we are only stewards or trustees of God’s creation, and we aren’t to abuse or neglect it. The Bible says, “The earth is the Lord’s, and everything in it, the world, and all who live in it” (Psalm 24:1).
When we fail to see the world as God’s creation, we will end up abusing it. Selfishness and greed take over, and we end up not caring about the environment or the problems we’re creating for future generations. It’s not surprising that some of the world’s worst environmental damage was done by the old atheistic regimes of Eastern Europe.
I hope you won’t lose your concern for these issues, for they are important. But don’t lose sight of something that is even more important: your relationship with God. Is Christ first in your life, and are you seeking to follow Him every day?
Are we in danger of destroying the world? >> Read Billy Graham’s Answer

Top impacting factors
Rise in health concern and increase in deaths due to surge in pollution levels
Rise in the deaths due to rise in pollution levels has resulted in various health issues, owing to which the adoption of the environment monitoring system has increased across the globe. In addition, rise in human population has continued to increase the industrial development, owing to which the production of pollution remains inevitable. Thus, there has been an increase in the adoption of environmental monitoring solution in among the emerging countries. Moreover, in emerging countries such as India, China, and Japan air pollution is considered as one of the leading factors for the rising health issues in the country. For instance, according to survey conducted by Lancet Planetary Health journal in 2017, India has suffered 26% of the premature mortality and health loss are caused due the increase in the air pollution globally. Furthermore, different countries have adopted various pollution monitoring tools for maintaining a healthy and balance lifestyle in the country. For instance, according to a survey conducted by WHO in Geneva, countries and various organizations have taken 70 commitments to improve the quality of the air and maintain a healthy lifestyle.
Rise in need of better natural resource management
There is an increase in the global population and urbanization. According to a research, it is estimated that around 9 billion people are expected to live in cities or urban centers by 2050, which will be the major factor leading to resource scarcity in the upcoming years. Moreover, as cities drive the economic growth in most of the countries, urbanization is projected to increase further in the near future. To cope with rise in urbanization and climate change issues, innovation and digital technology must be leveraged to minimize energy consumption and improve quality of life. Also, innovation must be combined with energy, digital technology, and information & communications technology to address urbanization challenges and ensure sustainability, which is expected to drive the growth of the market in near future. Furthermore, solar energy needs to be encouraged. The government has started taking initiative for adoption of solar energy. However, use of gas along with solar and wind energy is less than 2% at present, which is very crucial.

Increase in residential construction and rapid urbanization in developing countries are some of the factors leading to the growth of the market. For instance, urbanization in India grew by 0.98% from 2018-2019. In addition, employment opportunities provided for educated and skilled individuals who can efficiently manufacture green roofs is another factor, which fuels the growth of the market.
Moreover, the green roof market is projected to register a significant growth, owing to rising global warming, which in turn, leads to rise in demand for effective natural methods to reduce heat in the atmosphere. In addition, government initiatives to attract organizations or individuals for adopting a green roof product fuel the growth of the market. For instance, in September 2019, the Hamburg government gave a subsidy of 30-60% on installation cost of green roof systems; thereby providing a lucrative opportunity for the green roof market growth. Increase in construction of industrial, commercial, and residential buildings is expected to escalate the demand for green roof systems to regulate temperature of roof and surrounding areas. Further, government support to eliminate toxic greenhouse gases and reduce global warming is anticipated to create lucrative opportunities for the market during the forecast period.
However, lack of proper designing layout and guidelines for the installation of a green roofing is expected to hinder the growth of the market. Moreover, benefits of tax offered by governments to private companies are projected to provide lucrative opportunities for the growth of the green roof market.

Learn more about the work of the OECD Environment Directorate, who we are and how we work. . The expansion of global trade and the increasing integration of global value chains raise questions about how trade and the environment interact with each other. What are the effects of trade on the environment? And inversely, how can a changing natural environment (e.g. climate change impact) modify trade patterns? Is trade liberalisation good or bad for the environment? What are the short term and long term consequences and can an optimal combination of trade and environment policies harness the benefits of trade while minimizing environmental costs?
Economic growth resulting from trade expansion can have an obvious direct impact on the environment by increasing pollution or degrading natural resources. In addition, trade liberalisation may lead to specialisation in pollution-intensive activities in some countries if environmental policy stringency differs across countries – the so-called pollution haven hypothesis.
However, increased trade can in turn, by supporting economic growth, development, and social welfare, contribute to a greater capacity to manage the environment more effectively. More importantly, open markets can improve access to new technologies that make local production processes more efficient by diminishing the use of inputs such as energy, water, and other environmentally harmful substances.
Similarly, trade and investment liberalisation can provide firms with incentives to adopt more stringent environmental standards. As a country becomes more integrated within the world economy, its export sector becomes more exposed to environmental requirements imposed by the leading importers. Changes needed to meet these requirements, in turn, flow backwards along the supply chain, stimulating the use of cleaner production processes and technologies.
Direct consequences of climate change on trade could come from more frequent extreme weather events and rising sea levels. Supply, transport and distribution chains infrastructure are likely to become more vulnerable to disruptions due to climate change. Maritime shipping, which accounts for around 80% of global trade by volume, could experience negative consequences, for instance from more frequent port closures due to extreme events. More importantly, climate change is expected to decrease the productivity of all production factors (i.e. labor, capital and land), which will ultimately result in output losses and a decrease in the volume of global trade.
At the same time, there could also be positive economic impacts on maritime shipping through the potential further opening of Arctic shipping routes, albeit at the cost of environmental degradation.
Effective environmental policies and institutional frameworks are needed at the local, regional, national, and international levels. The impact of trade liberalisation on a country’s welfare depends on whether appropriate environmental policies are in place within the country in question (e.g. correctly pricing exhaustible environmental resources). Stringent environmental policies are compatible with an open trade regime as they create markets for environmental goods that can subsequently be exported to countries that follow suit on environmental strandards – the so-called first-mover advantage. This is especially true for complex technologies such as renewable energies.
Countries have undertaken a number of environment-related efforts under the World Trade Organization (WTO) framework including negotiating tariff reductions in environmental goods and services, seeking more clarity on the relationship between existing WTO rules and specific trade obligations in multilateral environmental agreements, and seeking disciplines on fisheries subsidies. In this way, the WTO is building a multilateral framework for international trade that also discourages any misguided temptation to engage in a “race to the bottom”.
The inclusion of environmental provisions in bilateral and regional trade agreements has also helped harmonise environmental regulations between developed and developing countries. More advanced economies can provide resources and institutions for capacity building, and can encourage less-developed partners to strengthen environmental regulations. The OECD has addressed many issues on trade and environment such as environment and regional trade agreements (RTAs) the drivers of environmental provisions in RTAs, as well as the stringency of environmental policies as a driver for trade in goods in environmental goods and services. We are also currently developing a set of policy indicators on trade and environment to help monitor progress towards more policy coherence, and to identify policy priorities at the intersection of trade and environment.

Businesses can play a major role in contributing to economic, environmental and social progress, especially when they minimise the adverse impacts of their operations, supply chains and other business relationships. The OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises recommend that enterprises conduct due diligence in order to identify, prevent or mitigate and account for how actual and potential adverse impacts are addressed.
The OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Business Conduct provides practical support to enterprises on the implementation of the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises by providing plain-language explanations of its due diligence recommendations and associated provisions. Implementing these recommendations can help enterprises avoid and address adverse impacts related to workers, human rights, the environment, bribery, consumers and corporate governance that may be associated with their operations, supply chains and other business relationships. The Guidance includes additional explanations, tips and illustrative examples of due diligence.
This Guidance also seeks to promote a common understanding among governments and stakeholders on due diligence for responsible business conduct. The UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, as well as the ILO Tripartite Declaration of Principles Concerning Multinational Enterprises and Social Policy, also contain due diligence recommendations, and this Guidance can help enterprises implement them.
The Guidance was adopted on 31 May 2018 during the annual OECD Ministerial Meeting at Council level.
Countries commit to step up efforts to drive more responsible business conduct through new OECD instrument

Related Documents . Twenty years after the first Rio Summit, the world continues to face a twin challenge: expanding economic opportunities for all in the context of a growing global population; and addressing environmental pressures that, if left unaddressed, could undermine our ability to seize these opportunities. Green growth is where these two challenges meet and it is about exploiting the opportunities to realise the two together.
Green growth means fostering economic growth and development while ensuring that natural assets continue to provide the resources and environmental services on which our well-being relies.
To do this it must catalyse investment and innovation which will underpin sustained growth and give rise to new economic opportunities.
Green growth is not a replacement for sustainable development. Rather, it provides a practical and flexible approach for achieving concrete, measurable progress across its economic and environmental pillars, while taking full account of the social consequences of greening the growth dynamic of economies. The focus of green growth strategies is ensuring that natural assets can deliver their full economic potential on a sustainable basis. That potential includes the provision of critical life support services – clean air and water, and the resilient biodiversity needed to support food production and human health. Natural assets are not infinitely substitutable and green growth policies take account of that.
In May 2011, the OECD delivered its Green Growth Strategy to Heads of State and Ministers from over forty countries, who welcomed it as a useful tool for expanding economic growth and job creation through more sustainable use of natural resources, efficiencies in the use of energy, and valuation of ecosystem services.
The Strategy responds to a request from Ministers of the 34 countries who signed the Green Growth Declaration in 2009, committing to strengthen their efforts to pursue green growth strategies as part of their response to the economic crisis and beyond.
Green growth policies are an integral part of the structural reforms needed to foster strong, more sustainable and inclusive growth. They can unlock new growth engines by:
Strategies for greener growth need to be tailored to fit specific country circumstances. They will need to carefully consider how to manage any potential trade-offs and best exploit the synergies between green growth and poverty reduction. The latter include, for example, bringing more efficient infrastructure to people (e.g. in energy, water and transport), tackling poor health associated with environmental degradation and introducing efficient technologies that can reduce costs and increase productivity, while easing environmental pressure. Given the centrality of natural assets in low-income countries, green growth policies can reduce vulnerability to environmental risks and increase the livelihood security of the poor.
Green growth strategies also recognise that focusing on GDP as the main measure of economic progress generally overlooks the contribution of natural assets to wealth, health and well-being. They therefore need to rely on a broader range of measures of progress, encompassing the quality and composition of growth, and how this affects people’s wealth and welfare.
The OECD is working to identify the policy mixes and measurement tools that countries in different situations can adopt to implement green growth in a way that contributes to poverty eradication, employment opportunities, and a strong and sustainable economy.
The starting point of OECD work is that there is no “one-size-fits-all” prescription for fostering greener growth. Greening the growth path of an economy depends on policy and institutional settings, level of development, social structures, resource endowments and particular environmental pressure points. Advanced, emerging, and developing countries will face different challenges and opportunities. While national plans will differ, in all cases green growth strategies need to go hand-in-hand with the main pillars of action to promote social equity: more intensive human capital investment, inclusive employment promotion, and well-designed tax/transfer redistribution policies.
The OECD report on Green Growth and Developing Countries aims to identify promising areas in which green growth objectives could be achieved and the policies, regulations, technology transfer, financing and new market and innovation opportunities that could help to deliver them. It reviews key barriers and includes options for a policy framework and a set of criteria that developing countries could consider in their efforts towards green growth policy making. Work will also commence on how progress could be assessed.
The report was developed based on a consultative process with developing countries. It aims to provide a platform for developing country partners to indicate their interest in collaborating with the OECD to shape a green growth agenda that is feasible and relevant for them and addresses the aspirations of their citizens.

The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are broad and ambitious, calling on all countries – be they upper, middle or low income – to make tangible improvements to the lives of their citizens. The goals encompass social, environmental and economic aspects.
The OECD supports the United Nations in ensuring the success of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development by bringing together its existing knowledge, and its unique tools and experience, including:
In addition, OECD partnerships are creating synergies among private and public, domestic and international, and donor and developing country resources to provide countries with a strong support mechanism on which to build towards a better future.

The Study has been undertaken to assist member countries with their national implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, but also to help countries navigate the SDGs’ complexity and identify priorities within the broad SDG Agenda. Drawing on the IAEG Global List of indicators and leveraging on the wealth of OECD data, this methodology evaluates the distance countries need to travel to meet each target.
The multi-dimensional nature of the SDGs requires linkages across policy areas. The OECD addresses the multidimensional nature of diverse issues through a variety of horizontal projects and international initiatives. Its Policy Coherence for Sustainable Development Framework helps to identify synergies and trade-offs among economic, social and environmental policy areas.
The SDGs provide a solid foundation for supporting resilient societies, dealing with humanitarian emergencies, and reducing risks of instability and shocks – even in the most difficult places.
The OECD is helping countries to review their policies and approaches to working in challenging contexts to ensure they are fit for purpose.

The OECD also works with developing countries on many fronts to support them in mobilising domestic resources.
Official development assistance (ODA), which is tracked and monitored by the OECD, will remain at the core of many developing countries’ financing portfolios – especially the neediest countries. In addition, the new OECD-developed framework for total official support for sustainable development (TOSSD) captures a wide range of resources in support of sustainable development that complement ODA.
|Supporting inclusive growth and well-being|
The SDGs promise to leave no one behind, putting sustainable development in motion everywhere, for the benefit of all.
The OECD Framework for Measuring Well-Being and Progress goes beyond GDP growth and is increasingly being used by developing countries to identify and assess development challenges. Other OECD projects, such as the Inclusive Growth initiative, the Multi-Dimensional Country Reviews, regional policy assessment programmes, and youth inclusion and social protection projects in developing countries also incorporate well-being.
The OECD works in particular to deliver the SDGs for women and girls through a range of partnerships and programmes. It also provides solid and comprehensive policies for the integration of migrants and their children.

|Ensuring the planet's sustainability|
Successful implementation of the SDGs will require striking a balance between socio-economic progress, sustaining the planet’s resources and ecosystems, and combatting climate change.
OECD works with its members, partner countries and other stakeholders to ensure sound environmental management that supports the sustained achievement of economic development and prosperity, while delivering human security and resilience. For example, together with the World Water Council, the OECD has created a High Level Panel on Financing Infrastructure for a Water Secure World.
The OECD tracks international climate finance and is sharing its expertise on these flows, and on the implications of different methodologies for estimating climate finance.

|Promoting partnerships|
To implement the SDG goals and targets, governments all over the world, international and non-governmental organisations, the private sector and civil society will need to team up. Working together they can unlock the necessary financial resources, share technologies and create national capacities.
The OECD provides a platform for dialogue and exchange. Together with UNDP it supports the Global Partnership for Effective Development Co-operation, which brings all stakeholders to the table to discuss development issues on an equal footing.

|Strengthening data availability and capacity|
Turning the ambition of the SDGs into reality will require robust data to capture progress and evidence to inform decision making.
The OECD is helping countries to track progress in areas such as trust, health inequalities, green growth, income and consumption inequality, and job quality. It supports countries in developing and using environmental and green growth indicators and in achieving environment-economy integration over time.
The OECD also supports developing countries in building their own statistical capacities and systems through the PARIS21 partnership.

|Facilitating follow up and review|
Inclusive follow up and review mechanisms will be essential to incentivise action and learning around the 2030 Agenda.
OECD country assessments, peer reviews and peer learning mechanisms across a range of policy fields – economic, investment, environmental, energy, migration, education, development co-operation and more – play a key role in sharing learning and knowledge, improving policies and practices, and building trust and mutual respect among partners.
The OECD is adapting its range of assessment and learning mechanisms - including the Programme for International Student Assessment, or PISA - to the new 2030 Agenda.

globalissues,https://www.globalissues.org/article/171/loss-of-biodiversity-and-extinctions ,"Despite knowing about biodiversity’s importance for a long time, human activity has been causing massive extinctions. As the Environment New Service, reported back in August 1999 (previous link): the current extinction rate is now approaching 1,000 times the background rate and may climb to 10,000 times the background rate during the next century, if present trends continue [resulting in] a loss that would easily equal those of past extinctions. (Emphasis added)
Additionally, as reported by UC Berkeley, using DNA comparisons, scientists have discovered what they have termed as an evolutionary concept called parallelism, a situation where two organisms independently come up with the same adaptation to a particular environment. This has an additional ramification when it comes to protecting biodiversity and endangered species. This is because in the past what we may have considered to be one species could actually be many. But, as pointed out by scientists, by putting them all in one group, it under-represents biodiversity, and these different evolutionarily species would not be getting the protection otherwise needed.
Increasing rapid ocean acidification, caused by the oceans absorbing more carbon dioxide than usual (because it is emitted by humans more than it should) also affects marine ecosystems, as explained on this site’s climate change and biodiversity page.
What also makes this a problem is that many of the endangered species are only found in small areas of land, often within the borders of a single country.
New species of animals and plants are still being discovered. In Papua New Guinea, 44 new species of animals were discovered recently in the forests. Logging may affect these animals’ habitats, though. The loss of rainforests around the world, where many species of life are found will mean that potential knowledge, whether medicinal, sustenance sources, or evolutionary and scientific information etc. could be lost.
Brazil, which is estimated to have around 55,000 species of flora, amounting to some 22% of the world’s total and India for example, which has about 46,000 and some 81,000 animal species (amounting to some 8% of the world’s biodiversity), are also under various pressures, from corporate globalization, deforrestation, etc. So too are many other biodiverse regions, such as Indonesia, parts of Africa, and other tropical regions.
Sustainable Forests or Sustainable Profits?
The overly corporate-led form of globalization that we see today also affects how natural resources are used and what priorities they are used for.
We hear more about sustainable forestry practices by the large logging multinationals. However, what does that really mean? Who is it sustainable for? Society and the environment, or for the logging companies? By replanting trees that will grow quickly and allow them to be felled for sustained logging sounds like a good strategy. However, the trees that are favored for this (eucalyptus) require a lot of water to grow so quickly. As John Madeley points out:
Madeley continues by describing the impact that the use of chemicals to treat woodpulp from the eucalyptus has on local fisheries and on food production. This has had terrible effects on indigenous people within such regions.
Illegal Timber Trade on a Large Scale
Some government institutions even buy illegal timber from pristine forests. For example, it is claimed that UK buys all of its Mahogany from pristine forests in Brazil where 80% of all timber is traded illegally. Even though Brazil has now tried to introduce a moratorium on Mahogany logging for two years, this has been slammed by some as too little, too late.
Legal Timber Trade on a Large Scale
Under much secrecy, there is a push from USA and Asian economies to reduce tariffs for wood and paper products. Also at the WTO Ministerial meeting in November 1999, opening more markets for easier access was the agenda, which included forests.
People and Forests
Quite often we make blanket statements or generalized conclusions that people are the cause of deforestation. While that is true, unfortunately all people around the world are not equal, and it also also follows that some are more responsible for deforestation than others. Often, in forests of the Amazon, Africa, or Asia, forest protection schemes have been promoted that go against indigenous peoples and cultures, rather than work with them.
As Indian activist and scientist Vandana Shiva and others have shown in countless work, indigenous people often have their cultures and lifestyle structured in a way that works with nature and would not undermine their own resource base. For example, in her book Stolen Harvests (South End Press, 2000) she describes how their traditional knowledge has been beneficial to the environment and has been developed and geared towards this understanding and respect of the ecosystems around them.
Yet because of blanket conclusions that humankind is responsible for deforestation, we risk assuming all types of societies are equally responsible for deforestation that is damaging to the environment. (This hints then, that for sustainable development projects, a more participatory approach can be accepted by local people, reducing the chance for conflict and distrust and therefore be more likely to succeed as well.)
As the cartoon, further above, from the Delhi-based Centre for Science and Environment notes, logging companies and others can often have a larger impact on deforestation. Industrial agriculture and beef production for example, is a major cause of deforestation in the Amazon, to raise cattle. This is not even for local needs, but to meet fast food restaurant demands in the Northern countries. A combination of geopolitics and economic agreements foster a scenario for such results to occur.
For more on this aspect of people and biodiversity, you can see also the following:
Pining for More, an article from their Down to Earth magazine (Vol 10, No 18 February 15, 2001). This article describes how Pine-based sustainable forests are not sustainable at all, and that Pine trees even make forest fires spread rapidly, while degrading local ecology, but grow fast, which is good for business.
On this web site’s population and environmental stress section, there is in-depth discussion on flawed and missed out assumption regarding ecological limits and factors that affect environmental degradation. These errors lead to often blaming the wrong groups of people for the problems and therefore lead to the promotion of inappropriate policies to deal with the issues.
Beef from this web site describes many aspects of deforestation and provides links and sources to other information.
Ogiek web site. This web site is about the Ogiek indigenous people of Kenya’s Mau Forest, and highlights an example of how they are being denied to live on their lands, for fears of deforestation issues. Yet, logging companies have an interest in this forest as well.
This article titled Forests and Deforestation. This is a good article which also points out that humans are not inherently harmful to forest, and have in some cases positively contributed to forest evolution. It has a good look at various factors involved.
How land is used to produce food can have enormous impacts on the environment and its sustainability. And this often has nothing to do with populations. Take the following as an example:
Because industrial agriculture promotes the use of monocultures, rather than a diversity of crops, the loss of biodiversity is leading to more resource usage, as described above. This as well as other political situations such as the motives for dumping surplus food on to developing countries to undersell the local farmers, leads to further hunger around the world.
For more information on land and hunger issues, this web site provides sections on:
If ecosystems deteriorates to an unsustainable level, then the problems resulting can be very expensive, economically, to reverse.
In Bangladesh and India, for example, logging of trees and forests means that the floods during the monsoon seasons can be very deadly. Similarly, many avalanches, and mud slides in many regions around the world that have claimed many lives, may have been made worse by the clearing of so many forests, which provide a natural barrier, that can take the brunt of such forces.
Vanishing coral reefs, forests and other ecosystems can all take their toll and even make the effects of some natural events even worse.
The cost of the effects together with the related problems that can arise (like disease, and other illness, or rebuilding and so on) is much more costly than the maintenance and sustainable development practices that could be used instead.
As an example, and assuming a somewhat alarmist scenario, if enough trees and forests and related ecosystems vanish or deteriorate sufficiently:
Then the oxygen-producing benefits from such ecosystems is threatened.
The atmosphere would suffer from more pollution.
The cost to tackle this and the related illnesses, problems and other cascading effects would be enormous (as it can be assumed that industrial pollution could increase, with less natural ecosystems to soak it up)
Furthermore, other species in that ecosystem that would depend on this would be further at risk as well, which would lead to a downward spiral for that ecosystem.
Compare those costs to taking precautionary measures such as protecting forests and promoting more sustainable forms of development. Of course, people will argue that these situations will not occur for whatever reasons. Only when it is too late can others say told you so — a perhaps very nasty Catch 22.
Social costs to some segments of society can also be high. Take for example the various indigenous Indians of Latin America. Throughout the region, as aspects of corporate globalization spread, there is growing conflict between land and resources of the indigenous communities, and those required to meet globalization related needs. The following quote from a report on this issue captures this quite well:
Why is it that these problems seem to be in developing countries? Don’t they know how to take care of their environment? That is what many ask in the industrialized nations. What people in the richer countries often fail to realize is that often their very own lending hand has been the one that takes most of what the environment has to offer, often in an unsustainable way. The debt that the poor countries are in has led to the stripping of resources in order to pay back what is owed. To learn more:
This web site’s look at Consumption and consumerism provides a deeper look at the enormous costs to society and to the environment by certain consumption habits. Given that the culture of consumption is so central to most societies today, it is often the system itself that is very wasteful.
this web site’s page on structural adjustment has more details of how debt has occurred and the structural adjustment policies that have led to governments stripping their environmental resources, reducing the cost of labor, exporting more to the industrialized countries, often without feeding their own people first, repaying more debt than spending on health or education, and so on.
We have seen a glimpse of how the environment is related to global policies that have caused poverty and how poverty can affect the environment. Slowly, projects are helping at the local level for people to take ownership of their environment and help foster a sustainable development cycle. However, globalization, in its current form may have additional effects on the environment too. To learn more about how trade and poverty in general are related, go to this web site’s section on Trade, Economy, & Related Issues.
The Genetically Engineered Food section in this web site also discusses issues to do with patenting foods and seeds and introduces issues to do with the importance of agricultural diversity and other issues related to patents on genetic resources.

- Adjusted net national income > Constant 2000 US$: Adjusted net national income (constant 2000 US$). Adjusted net national income is GNI minus consumption of fixed capital and natural resources depletion.
- CO2 Emissions per 1000: CO2: Total Emissions (excluding land-use) Units: thousand metric tonnes of carbon dioxide. Figures expressed per thousand population for the same year.
- Climate change > CO2 emissions from electricity and heat production, total > Million metric tons: CO2 emissions from electricity and heat production, total (million metric tons). CO2 emissions from electricity and heat production is the sum of three IEA categories of CO2 emissions: (1) Main Activity Producer Electricity and Heat which contains the sum of emissions from main activity producer electricity generation, combined heat and power generation and heat plants. Main activity producers (formerly known as public utilities) are defined as those undertakings whose primary activity is to supply the public. They may be publicly or privately owned. This corresponds to IPCC Source/Sink Category 1 A 1 a. For the CO2 emissions from fuel combustion (summary) file, emissions from own on-site use of fuel in power plants (EPOWERPLT) are also included. (2) Unallocated Autoproducers which contains the emissions from the generation of electricity and/or heat by autoproducers. Autoproducers are defined as undertakings that generate electricity and/or heat, wholly or partly for their own use as an activity which supports their primary activity. They may be privately or publicly owned. In the 1996 IPCC Guidelines, these emissions would normally be distributed between industry, transport and ""other"" sectors. (3) Other Energy Industries contains emissions from fuel combusted in petroleum refineries, for the manufacture of solid fuels, coal mining, oil and gas extraction and other energy-producing industries. This corresponds to the IPCC Source/Sink Categories 1 A 1 b and 1 A 1 c. According to the 1996 IPCC Guidelines, emissions from coke inputs to blast furnaces can either be counted here or in the Industrial Processes source/sink category. Within detailed sectoral calculations, certain non-energy processes can be distinguished. In the reduction of iron in a blast furnace through the combustion of coke, the primary purpose of the coke oxidation is to produce pig iron and the emissions can be considered as an industrial process. Care must be taken not to double count these emissions in both Energy and Industrial Processes. In the IEA estimations, these emissions have been included in this category.

- Water > Freshwater pollution: Industrial organic pollutants per available freshwater
Units: Metric Tons of BOD Emissions per Cubic Km of Water
Units: Emissions of organic water pollutants are measured by biochemical oxygen demand, which refers to the amount of oxygen that bacteria in water will consume in breaking down waste. This is a standard water-treatment test for the presence of organic pollutants. The data from the World Bank, which represented BOD emissions (kilograms per day) were normalized by the combination of water availability per capita and water inflow availability per capita from the WaterGap2.1 model. In calculating the ESI, the base-10 logarithm of this variable was used.

- Water > Severe water stress: Percent of country's territory under severe water stress
Units: Percent of Land Area
Units: This data is derived from the WaterGap 2.1 gridded hydrological model developed by the Center for Environmental Systems Research, University of Kassel, Germany. The modellers derived, for each country, grid cell by grid cell estimates of whether the water consumption exceeds 40 percent of the water available in that particular grid cell. These were then converted to land area equivalents in order to calculate the percentage of the territory under severe water stress.
- CFC > Consumption: CFC consumption
Units: Ozone Depletion Potential (ODP) Tons (Metric Tons x ODP)
Units: The indicator was obtained by multiplying the Total CFCs emissions (metric tons per ozone depletion potential) with the Per capita CFCs emissions (obtained by dividing the total CFCs emissions by the population in 1997). In calculating the ESI, the base-10 logarithm of this variable was used.

CO2 emissions from electricity and heat production is the sum of three IEA categories of CO2 emissions: (1) Main Activity Producer Electricity and Heat which contains the sum of emissions from main activity producer electricity generation, combined heat and power generation and heat plants. Main activity producers (formerly known as public utilities) are defined as those undertakings whose primary activity is to supply the public. They may be publicly or privately owned. This corresponds to IPCC Source/Sink Category 1 A 1 a. For the CO2 emissions from fuel combustion (summary) file, emissions from own on-site use of fuel in power plants (EPOWERPLT) are also included. (2) Unallocated Autoproducers which contains the emissions from the generation of electricity and/or heat by autoproducers. Autoproducers are defined as undertakings that generate electricity and/or heat, wholly or partly for their own use as an activity which supports their primary activity. They may be privately or publicly owned. In the 1996 IPCC Guidelines, these emissions would normally be distributed between industry, transport and ""other"" sectors. (3) Other Energy Industries contains emissions from fuel combusted in petroleum refineries, for the manufacture of solid fuels, coal mining, oil and gas extraction and other energy-producing industries. This corresponds to the IPCC Source/Sink Categories 1 A 1 b and 1 A 1 c. According to the 1996 IPCC Guidelines, emissions from coke inputs to blast furnaces can either be counted here or in the Industrial Processes source/sink category. Within detailed sectoral calculations, certain non-energy processes can be distinguished. In the reduction of iron in a blast furnace through the combustion of coke, the primary purpose of the coke oxidation is to produce pig iron and the emissions can be considered as an industrial process. Care must be taken not to double count these emissions in both Energy and Industrial Processes. In the IEA estimations, these emissions have been included in this category.

Executive summary
Plastics are among the most universally used materials in modern society. Since the 1950s, the production and use of plastics has been increasing faster than that of any other material, mostly due to their durability and low cost. However, the improper management of plastic waste has led to plastics becoming ubiquitous in all major compartments of the environment. Plastic that is discarded, disposed of, or abandoned in the environment outside of a managed waste stream is considered plastic pollution. Plastic pollution has been detected on shorelines, and in surface waters, sediment, soil, groundwater, indoor and outdoor air, drinking water and food. In Canada, it is estimated that 1% of plastic waste enters the environment, representing 29 000 tonnes of plastic pollution in 2016. Since plastic degrades very slowly and is persistent in the environment, the amount of plastic pollution is anticipated to continue to increase over time. There are growing concerns that plastic pollution may adversely impact the health of the environment and humans.
The purpose of this report is to summarize the current state of the science regarding the potential impacts of plastic pollution on the environment and human health, as well as to guide future research and inform decision-making on plastic pollution in Canada. It provides a review of the available information on plastic pollution, including its sources, occurrence, and fate, as well as on the potential effects of plastics on the environment and human health. This report is not intended to quantify the risks of plastic pollution on the environment or human health, but rather to survey the existing state of science in order to guide future scientific and regulatory activities.
Plastics are often defined by their size, with macroplastics being larger than 5 mm and microplastics being less than or equal to 5 mm. Plastic waste can be released into the environment as complete materials (e.g., discarded single-use or short-lived products, such as plastic bags and straws), as large pieces of plastics (e.g., fragments of plastic products) or as microplastics (e.g., microfibres released from washing of clothes or microbeads released through wastewater). Microplastics can also be formed through the breakdown of larger plastic items in the environment.
While plastics can degrade, the rate at which they break down is very slow and can be affected by multiple factors, such as temperature and light. In water, the rate of degradation is temperature dependent, being slower in cold water. The lack of exposure to sunlight also slows down the degradation of plastics. While oxidation can promote the degradation of plastics in soil, the rate of degradation is still slow. Although biodegradable plastics and bioplastics are increasingly being used as alternatives to conventional plastics, they may not degrade more readily than conventional plastics once in the environment.
Plastic packaging is the biggest contributor of plastic waste in Canada, followed by the automotive, textile, and electrical and electronic equipment sectors. The release of synthetic microfibres from wastewater treatment systems (WWTS) is also anticipated to represent a significant source of microplastic pollution. In WWTS, microplastics removed from wastewater settle in sewage sludge and are then released to land through the application of biosolids. The presence of microplastics in outdoor air is largely thought to be attributable to tire wear and tear, while microplastics in indoor air result from the shedding of fibres from clothing, furniture, carpeting and household goods.
It is clear that plastic pollution is found everywhere in the environment. In Canada, single-use plastics make up the bulk of plastic litter that is found in freshwater environments. The most common litter items collected on Canadian shorelines include bottle caps, plastic bags, plastic bottles, straws, and cigarette butts. Large numbers of microplastic particles are also found in fresh and marine surface waters. Globally, microfibres are the most abundant type of microplastics found in water. However, it is recognized that there is a lack of standardized, high-quality methods for sampling plastics, particularly for measuring and characterizing microplastics.
Microplastics are also found in sediment and soil. Through various mechanisms, such as the formation of biofilms—layers of microorganisms that form on a surface—microplastics in surface waters may eventually sink, leading to the accumulation of microplastics in the bottom sediment of both freshwater and marine environments. Soils are also expected to act as a major sink for plastic particles, as microplastics are likely to remain in soils for long periods due to factors such as vertical transport, which pulls particles down from the surface and thereby slows down their degradation. Microplastics may travel from soil into groundwater.
Air is also anticipated to be an important pathway for microplastic transport, and microplastics have been detected in both indoor and outdoor air. While there are no Canadian data available on the occurrence of microplastics in air, data from other parts of the world show that concentrations are higher in indoor air than in outdoor air. Indoors, microplastics are also found in settled house dust.
Current data on the occurrence of microplastics in food are limited, and most available information concerns microplastics found in seafood, specifically fish and shellfish from marine environments. In fish, microplastics have been found in both muscle tissue and the gastrointestinal tract, mostly as fragments and fibres. Microplastics have also been detected in mussels, clams, oysters, scallops and snails, and in a very small number of other foods, such as salt.
Internationally, a limited number of studies have investigated the presence of microplastics in tap and bottled water. Microplastics have been detected in up to 93% of bottled water samples from outside of Canada, with concentrations varying across bottle type (i.e., plastic, glass or cardboard) and intended use conditions (i.e., single-use versus multi-use bottles). In the case of tap water, some studies have detected microplastics while others have not. Drinking water treatment is anticipated to remove a large proportion of microplastic particles.
Plastic pollution has been shown to impact organisms and their habitats. Macroplastic pollution can cause physical harm to biota, often as a result of entanglement or ingestion. Entanglement can lead to suffocation, strangulation, or smothering, and a high frequency of reported entanglement occurrences has led to the direct harm or mortality of biota. Ingestion can lead to direct harm through physical damage; it can block airways or intestinal systems leading to suffocation or starvation. The observed effects of microplastics on biota are either primarily driven by physical effects or due to the presence of residual chemicals used to make the plastic or of other chemical pollutants from the environment that may adsorb onto the plastic. Published studies on exposure to microplastics report conflicting observations of effects, even for the same endpoint in the same species. Conflicting information on ecotoxicological effects could be attributed to the difficulties that exist in testing the effects of microplastics in organisms and the lack of standardized test methods.
Humans may be exposed to microplastics via the ingestion of food, bottled water, and tap water, as well as through the inhalation of indoor and outdoor air. However, information on the human health effects of microplastics is limited. Some associations between exposures to high levels of microplastics and adverse health effects in laboratory animals and in humans have been reported, but the health effects cannot be linked to exposure in the general population. Occupational inhalation exposure studies show associations between work in microplastic-related industries and increased incidence of various respiratory symptoms and diseases. Conflicting observations have been made for cancers of the respiratory tract and digestive system.
Effects observed in animal studies are primarily associated with tissues related to where particles enter the body (e.g., effects on the digestive system after oral exposure and on the respiratory tract after inhalation). Effects following oral exposure include inflammation of the liver, oxidative stress, metabolic changes, and altered gut microbiota. Effects in the respiratory tract are likely related to the physical impact of microplastics as particulate matter and include oxidative stress, cytotoxicity, inflammation, and development of foreign body granulomas. In both ingestion and inhalation studies, movement of a small fraction of microplastic particles to lymphatic or systemic tissues has been observed. No dose-response relationship has been observed in mortality, survival time, behaviour, clinical observations, or tumour incidence from inhalation exposures.
In addition to physical impacts, there are concerns that plastics may serve as a means of transport for other chemicals. Since plastics can contain unbound monomers and chemical additives and can sorb persistent organic pollutants from the environment, it is possible that these substances may be transported to organisms or humans, where they may then be released. The extent of release is expected to depend on a variety of factors, such as the properties of the receiving environment, the plastic particle, and the bound chemical. The current literature suggests that, while the transport of chemicals via plastics is possible, the impact to biota is likely limited, and recent international reviews indicate that there is likely a low health concern for human exposure to chemicals from ingestion of microplastics from food or drinking water (EFSA 2016; FAO 2017; WHO 2019). However, further research would be required before a human health risk assessment on microplastics is possible. Many of the chemicals observed to be bound to plastic particles have been assessed by various programs at Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) and Health Canada.
Plastics can also provide a habitat for microorganisms, including potential pathogens, through the formation of biofilms. There is currently no indication that microplastics-associated biofilms would impact human health. In addition, despite very limited data, it is anticipated that drinking water treatment would inactivate biofilm-associated microorganisms.
Given the increasing amounts of plastic pollution in the environment and the demonstrated ability of macroplastics to harm biota, it is anticipated that the frequency of occurrence of physical effects on individual environmental receptors will continue to increase if current trends continue.
There are a multitude of sources that contribute to plastic pollution. Under the precautionary principle, action is needed to reduce macroplastics and microplastics that end up in the environment.
In order to advance the understanding of the impacts of plastic pollution on the environment and human health, it is recommended that research be carried out in the following areas to address the key knowledge gaps identified in this report:
- Developing standardized methods for sampling, quantifying, characterizing, and evaluating the effects of macroplastics and microplastics;
- Furthering the understanding of human exposure to microplastics;
- Furthering the understanding of the ecotoxicological effects of microplastics;
- Furthering the understanding of the effects of microplastics on human health; and
- Expanding and developing consistent monitoring efforts to include poorly characterized environmental compartments such as soil.
1. Introduction
Plastics are part of the everyday lives of Canadians and populations around the world. Plastics are low cost, durable materials and can be used in a variety of applications (CCME 2018). For these reasons, global plastic production has been increasing over the past several decades at a rate faster than that of any other material (Geyer et al. 2017; CCME 2018). In Canada, total sales of plastic are estimated at $35 billion in 2017, with approximately 4 667 kt introduced to the Canadian market in 2016 (ECCC 2019a). Plastics are used in a variety of industrial sectors, and demand for plastic products continues to grow.
Poor management of plastics across their life cycle, as well as improper disposal, has resulted in large amounts of plastic waste entering the environment as plastic pollution (CCME 2018). In 2016, an estimated 9% of plastics were recycled, 86% were landfilled, 4% were incinerated for energy recovery, and 1% were released directly into the environment in Canada (ECCC 2019a). Of the 4 667 kt of plastics that entered the market in 2016, an estimated 3 268 kt were discarded as waste (ECCC 2019a). Of that amount, an estimated 29 kt were discarded outside of the normal waste stream (i.e., not landfilled, recycled or incinerated) in 2016, through direct release to the environment or through dumps or leaks (ECCC 2019a). As illustrated in Figure 1, if plastic manufacturing continues at its current pace, the accumulation of plastics will continue to accelerate. It is estimated that by 2050 12 000 000 kt of plastic waste will have been discarded globally to landfills or the environment (Geyer et al. 2017).
With the growing public and scientific concern about the ubiquity of plastic pollution, there has been increasing global media attention on the potential impacts of plastic pollution on human health and the environment (CCME 2018; ECCC 2019c; SAPEA 2019). The Government of Canada has put forward Canada’s Plastics Science Agenda (CaPSA), which aims to align current and future research investments across a range of disciplines (ECCC 2019c). The CaPSA framework identifies several key research priorities, including the detection of plastics in the environment, understanding and mitigating potential impacts on wildlife, human health and the environment, plastic design and alternatives, sustainable plastic production, and recycling and recovery.
1.1 Scope
This report summarizes the current state of the science on the potential impacts of plastic pollution on the environment and human health and informs future research and decision-making on plastic pollution in Canada. For the purposes of this report, plastic pollution has been divided into two main types: macroplastics (plastics greater than 5 mm in size) and microplastics (plastics less than or equal to 5 mm in size) (see Section 1.2 for definitions). This report discusses the sources, occurrence, and fate of plastic pollution in the environment, as well as the potential impacts of plastics on human health and the environment. Information identified up to June 2019 was considered for inclusion in this draft science assessment, in addition to the 2019 WHO report on microplastics in drinking water and the 2019 report on microfibres commissioned by Ocean Wise.
This report is a review of the current state of the science on plastic pollution. It is not intended as a substitute for chemical risk assessment, and it is similar to the approach taken for the Science Summary on Microbeads (ECCC 2015). Typically, a chemical risk assessment is conducted to assess the potential for risk to the environment and human health associated with a substance. However, significant data gaps currently exist that preclude the ability to conduct a quantitative risk assessment, including a lack of standardized methods for monitoring microplastics and characterizing the environmental and human health effects of plastics, as well as inconsistencies in the reporting of occurrence and effects data in the scientific literature (Gouin et al. 2019). Indeed, risk assessment frameworks for evaluating the potential risks associated with plastics are currently under development. For example, see Gouin et al. (2019) for a discussion on the development of an environmental risk assessment framework for microplastics.
As the focus of this report is on plastic pollution, it is limited to a review of the occurrence of macroplastics and microplastics resulting from plastic waste entering the environment and does not examine non-environmental sources (e.g., via exposure from consumer products or self-care products). Moreover, it does not review the economics of waste management practices or evaluate the efficacy of waste management streams (e.g., recycling).
1.2 Definitions
Plastics are often categorized by their size. The term microplastic was originally used to differentiate between substances that could only be visualized through a microscope and larger macroplastics (ECCC 2015). However, there is no one definition of what constitutes a microplastic. For the purpose of this report, plastic particles less than or equal to 5 mm in size are defined as microplastics, while plastics greater than 5 mm are defined as macroplastics. Microplastics can be further defined as primary or secondary microplastics. Primary microplastics are intentionally produced plastic particles (such as pellets, powders, and beads) that are either intended for use as microplastics or as precursors for the production of plastic or plastic-containing products. Primary microplastics are widely used as abrasives in a variety of applications (UNEP 2016). Secondary microplastics are not produced intentionally, but are the result of the breakdown and fragmentation of larger plastic items (SAPEA 2019). Furthermore, microfibres are a specific type of microplastic defined as being fibrous in shape and less than or equal to 5 mm in length. Nanoplastics are considered to be a subset of microplastics. They are primary or secondary microplastics that range from 1 to 100 nm in size in at least one dimension. Nanoplastics occur largely as a result of secondary sources of plastic pollution (i.e., the breakdown of larger plastics) (Rist and Hartmann 2018). This report will focus on plastics greater than 100 nm in size (i.e., microplastics and macroplastics).
For the purposes of this report, plastic waste that is released to the environment is defined as plastic pollution. In the scientific literature, plastic pollution has been referred to by a number of terms, such as plastic debris or plastic litter. This report will use the terms plastic pollution or plastic pollutants. Furthermore, in this report the term litter refers to any persistent, manufactured, or processed solid material discarded, disposed of, lost, or abandoned in the environment, including plastics, textiles, glass, metal, ceramics, and other persistent synthetic materials. This term will be used when the proportion of plastic pollution reported in the literature is unclear. In this report, plastic waste is considered to be plastics that enter the waste stream (e.g., landfilled, recycled or incinerated), whereas plastic pollution is considered to be plastic that is discarded, disposed of, or abandoned in the environment outside of a managed waste stream.
2. Composition, properties, and uses
All plastic materials are formed from long-chain polymers of very high molecular weight, often measured in the hundreds of thousands of kilodaltons (Sperling 2006). Synthetic polymers first appeared in the early 20th century, leading to the manufacture of plastic products such as Bakelite and nylon (commercial name for polyamides). Since then, polymer science has evolved, with a greater mechanistic understanding of the interrelationships between polymer structure, morphology, and physical and mechanical behaviour. This has resulted in the production of a myriad of plastic materials with varying physical and chemical properties.
Polymerization, the synthesis of polymers, can occur following one of two main processes: chain polymerization or stepwise polymerization. The process used to form polymers greatly influences their physical properties. Common chain polymer structures include polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS), and polyvinyl chloride (PVC), whereas common stepwise polymers include nylons, polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polycarbonate (PC), and polyurethane (PU). These represent many of the most common forms of plastics typically found as environmental contaminants (Sperling 2006).
The physical properties of plastic, such as rigidity, flexibility, and elasticity, are influenced by the polymer’s molecular weight distribution and organization of polymer chains (Sperling 2006; Verschoor 2015). Generally, high molecular-weight polymers with a complex organization that leads to strong covalent bonds between the polymers can result in the formation of a rigid plastic with a high melting point. In contrast, linear polymer organization with low molecular-weight distribution results in a more flexible plastic with a lower melting point. Combinations of different molecular weight distributions, different polymer chain organization, and/or blends of different types of polymers can produce a material that will be effective for its intended use (Sperling 2006).
Furthermore, many polymers are subject to additional processes aimed at enhancing efficacy with respect to an intended functionality. For instance, when heated, a linear polymer will flow, resulting in the formation of a thermoplastic (Sperling 2006). Thermoplastics are polymers commonly found in plastics that can be melted and reshaped into new objects. Commonly used thermoplastics include PVC, PE, PS, and PC (ECCC 2019b). To prevent flow upon heating, polymers can be cross-linked to produce a thermoset plastic (Sperling 2006). Thermoset plastics are polymers that are used for their resistance to mechanical forces, chemicals, wear, and heat, but they cannot be re-melted to form new objects. Examples include PU and unsaturated polyester polymers (ECCC 2019b).
Chemical additives can be added to polymers during production to alter the properties of plastics (Rochman et al. 2019). There are several categories of additives, including stabilizers and functional agents. Polymer stabilizers maintain the inherent properties of the material by protecting it against oxidative degradation. They include substances such as anti-oxidants, light stabilizers, metal deactivators, and ultra-violet absorbers. Functional agents can enhance the mechanical strength of a polymer or impart new characteristics. Examples of functional agents include flame-retardants, anti-static agents, lubricants, and plasticizers (ECCC 2019b). For instance, plasticizers can be added to soften a polymer by lowering its glass transition temperature or reducing the degree of crystallinity or melting point (Sperling 2006).
Polymer production can begin with either the use of recycled or recovered plastics or with natural resources (i.e., petroleum or plant-based starting material). These polymers are then used to manufacture plastic products (ECCC 2019b). Although many different types of plastic polymers are used in Canada, domestic plastic production is dominated by five polymer types. PE accounts for the majority of plastic production, with 3 700 kt produced in 2017, followed by PVC (210 kt), PET (166 kt), PU (122 kt) and polyamides (PA) (116 kt) (ECCC 2019b). Of the 4 800 kt of plastic polymers produced in Canada in 2016, 77% was exported. Further, there is a domestic demand of 3 800 kt, 71% of which is fulfilled through imports (ECCC 2019a).
The majority of plastic products in Canada are found in the packaging and construction sectors. Other major sectors include the automotive, electronic and electrical equipment, textiles, and agriculture sectors (ECCC 2019b). Examples of applications of various polymers are presented in Table 2-1.

The packaging sector is the largest user of plastics in Canada, accounting for 33% of end-use plastics introduced to the market in 2016. Examples of plastic packaging products include plastic bags, water and soft drink bottles, as well as various packaging used for pharmaceuticals, toiletries, and cleaning compounds. PE is very commonly used in packaging, specifically for films and flexible packaging (ECCC 2019b). Two major types of PE are low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and high-density polyethylene (HDPE). LDPE is generally used in heavier duty films, such as high durability bags and protective sheeting, due to its toughness, flexibility, and relative transparency. HDPE possesses good chemical resistance and thus is widely used in thin-gauge carrier bags, chemical drums, toys, food wrapping material, and kitchenware. In addition to PE, other plastic polymers can also be seen in the packaging sector, such as PVC, PET and PP.
Construction is the second-largest end-use market for plastics in Canada, accounting for approximately 26% of all end-use plastics generated in 2016 (ECCC 2019a). Primary uses of plastics in the construction sector include plastic and foam building and construction materials, paints and coatings, profile shapes, and reconstituted wood and plywood. Plastics are broadly used in the construction of all types of buildings and are especially used in thermal insulation materials, as well as waterproofing and sealant materials. PVC is widely used in siding and window applications, floor and wall covering products, as well as pipe and pipe fittings. Clear PC sheets are used as a substitute for glass in greenhouses, transit shelters, and covered walkways due to its resistance to weathering. PU foam is used as insulation in commercial and residential properties (ECCC 2019b).
In an effort to improve fuel efficiency through weight reduction, the automotive sector has increased its use of plastics. While many different types of plastics are used in the sector, PU, PP, and PVC make up the vast majority of total plastics used in a vehicle. PU is used in cushioning applications such as seating, PP is used in automobile interiors, and PVC is used for faux leather. PC can be used to replace glass in cars, while foam, plastic, and fibre composites can be used in door panels, dashboards, and hoods (ECCC 2019b).
Other end-use sectors include the electronic and electrical equipment, textile, and agriculture sectors. Plastics are used in the electronics sector for computer and phone parts, as well as items such as electric wires and cables. The textile sector uses plastics for fibres in carpets, rugs, mats, and clothing. In the agriculture sector, plastics are used for fertilizer and pesticide packaging (e.g., agricultural films, mulches, and greenhouses) (Ekebafe et al. 2011; ECCC 2019b).
Given the variety of plastic materials that can be produced, the physical and chemical properties of plastic particles present in the environment will be complex (Rochman et al. 2019). With respect to shape and size, primary microplastics are intentionally engineered to be a particular size (e.g., virgin resin pellets used in plastic manufacturing processes) and will therefore likely show less variation than secondary microplastics. Secondary microplastics can have a range of shapes, including spheres and cylinders, but also fragments, fibres, and films (Kooi and Koelmans 2019). Secondary microplastics are also highly variable in size and density. Recognizing the inherent challenge associated with defining the physical properties of microplastic particles observed in the environment, Kooi and Koelmans (2019) suggest a method aimed at defining and characterizing the distributions of properties most commonly encountered. The approach proposed by Kooi and Koelmans (2019) may prove useful in developing tools for monitoring plastics in the environment, providing a greater mechanistic understanding of the environmental fate of microplastics, and allowing for easy comparison between studies.
Microplastics can exist as fibres, fragments, spheres, pellets, films, and foams, as shown in Figure 2. In general, certain shapes of microplastics originate from certain plastic products. For example, fibres are typically shed from fabrics, such as clothing and upholstery, whereas pellets are typically from industrial feedstock (Rochman et al. 2019).
Density is a key property that influences the environmental fate of plastics (Rochman et al. 2019). Densities of plastic polymers such as PE, PS and PVC can range from 0.9 to 2.3 g/cm3 (WHO 2019).
Table 2-2 presents the densities of various plastic polymers. Polymers with a density greater than 1 are denser than water and are expected to sink, while those with a density less than 1 are expected to float. By analogy, the environmental fate and transport of macroplastics or microplastics released to the atmosphere are also likely to be influenced by their density. For example, denser microplastics are less likely to be readily dispersed by the wind (Rochman et al. 2019). The density of plastics and their buoyancy in water can also be influenced by the coating of plastics with microorganisms, algae, or plants (i.e., biofilms) (Woodall et al. 2014). Other factors, such as shape and size, can also govern the fate of plastics in the environment (Rochman et al. 2019).

3. Sources of plastic waste and pollution
The sources of global plastic pollution are varied, and actual amount of plastic pollution is largely unknown (UNEP 2016). Important land-based sources of macroplastics to the marine environment include packaging, construction, household goods, and coastal tourism (UNEP 2016). It is estimated that 40% of all plastic production is used for packaging, a significant portion of which is used for the food and drink sector (UNEP 2016). Other land-based sources of microplastics around the world include cosmetics and personal care products, synthetic textiles and clothing, terrestrial transport (i.e., tire wear), and plastic producers and fabricators (i.e., accidental loss of resin pellets) (UNEP 2016; SAPEA 2019). With respect to sea-based sources of plastic pollution, the fisheries, aquaculture, and shipping sectors are major contributors (GESAMP 2016; UNEP 2016). Plastics in these sectors may be lost at sea by accident, abandonment, or deliberate disposal (UNEP 2016; SAPEA 2019). Macroplastics and microplastics from land- and sea-based sources can enter the ocean through various entry points (i.e., wastewater, rivers, coasts), depending on the region (UNEP 2016).
In Canada, the main industrial sectors contributing to the estimated 3 268 kt of plastic waste discarded 2016 are presented in Table 3‑1. Plastic packaging is the single largest contributor of plastic waste, followed by the automotive, textile and electrical and electronic equipment sectors. In 2016, 33% of the plastics entering the Canadian marketplace was for use in packaging. However, due to the extremely short life cycle of plastics from packaging (i.e., most plastic packaging is single-use in nature) compared to plastics from other sectors, packaging accounts for 47% of the plastics discarded in that same year. Plastics generated from other industrial sectors, such as the automotive and construction sectors, have longer life cycles and therefore represent a smaller proportion of annual plastic waste as compared to packaging, which is typically discarded shortly after use (ECCC 2019a).
|Sector||Proportion of total plastic waste|
|Packaginga||47%|
|Automotive||9%|
|Textiles||7%|
|Electrical and electronic equipment||7%|
|Construction||5%|
|White goods (e.g., large and small appliances)||4%|
|Agriculture||1%|
|Otherb||19%|

Microfibres from laundering of textiles also represent a significant source to waterbodies. A report by Ocean Wise detailed the results of a study in which 38 different textile samples were tested for their shedding properties using a custom-designed washing machine test facility. The extent of microfibre shedding varied with the type of textile, with polyester, wool and cotton textiles releasing the largest amounts of microfibres. The report also estimates that the average Canadian household releases 533 million microfibres from laundry every year and that an estimated 878 tonnes of microfibres are released to water following wastewater treatment in Canada and the United States annually (Vassilenko et al. 2019).
Synthetic textiles and clothing are a large source of microplastic pollution (SAPEA 2019). Microfibres can be released from synthetic fabrics during wear and laundering, as well as from sources such as fishing gear (e.g., fishing nets) (ECCC 2019d). Carney Almroth et al. (2018) and De Falco et al. (2018) counted the number of microfibres released from different types of fabric under different laundering conditions. Both studies found that the use of a detergent increases the number of fibres released during washing. Powdered detergents, which often contain insoluble compounds that are able to create friction with the fabric, enable an even greater number of fibres to be released (De Falco et al. 2018). It has also been noted that powdered detergents have a higher pH compared to liquid detergents. While this is effective for soil removal, it can damage polyester fabrics by way of slow surface hydrolysis (Bishop 1995). Furthermore, fabric exposure to chemical detergents can cause the breakdown of synthetic fibres into smaller fibres (SAPEA 2019). The studies found that fleece garments and tightly knit fabrics released the greatest number of fibres during washing. It was found that on average, an adult-sized PET fleece garment releases an estimated 110 000 fibres during washing (Carney Almroth et al. 2018). A wash load of 5 kg of polyester garments was found to release 6 000 000 to 17 700 000 fibres, for an approximate weight of 0.43 to 1.27 g (De Falco et al. 2018).
Consumer products discarded to the environment or not properly managed may also represent a source of plastic pollution in the environment. While knowledge of the source of primary microplastics (i.e., the type and amount of microplastics intentionally used in consumer products) in Canada is limited, secondary microplastics may arise from the breakdown and fragmentation of macroplastics released to the environment. This may include consumer products such as toys, plastic gloves, appliances, electronics, mattress covers and flooring, as well as plastic materials used in packaging (Table 3‑1).
3.1 Sources to water
Plastic pollution in the aquatic environment can arise from plastics released during land-based activities (e.g., through littering, inadequate waste management, landfill leachate, the use of plastics in agriculture, land application of biosolids, or direct release following abrasion or maintenance of plastic products (Boucher and Friot 2017; Alimi et al. 2018), from the deposition of airborne microplastics onto water (Hendrickson et al. 2018), or from water-based sources (e.g., fishing-related litter (Driedger et al. 2015)). Plastic pollution in water may also arise from the accidental release of raw plastic materials, such as spillage during transport (Driedger et al. 2015) and from releases from wastewater effluent (Murphy et al. 2016; Boucher and Friot 2017; Kay et al. 2018).
The Arctic Council’s Protection of the Arctic Marine Environment (PAME) Working Group recently released the Desktop Study on Marine Litter including Microplastics in the Arctic as part of the first phase of a Marine Litter Project. The major sectors highlighted as sources of marine litter in the Arctic were fisheries, aquaculture, shipping, cruise tourism, and offshore resource exploration and exploitation. Approximately 640 kt of abandoned, lost or discarded fishing gear is estimated to be released to marine waters globally each year, accounting for 10% of all marine litter. In addition, releases from communities that are not connected to large waste management systems were flagged as sources of marine litter (PAME 2019).
3.1.1 Wastewater treatment
When wastewater containing plastics from domestic, commercial, and industrial sources passes through wastewater treatment systemsFootnote 1 (WWTSs), most of the plastics are removed prior to discharge to the aquatic environment.
Based on a review of several published studies, Sun et al. (2019) reported significant reductions in microplastic concentrations when comparing influent and effluent in various WWTSs: concentrations ranged from 1 to 10 044 particles/L for influent and from to 0 to 447 particles/L for effluent. While large variations in microplastic concentrations can be observed between WWTSs (Sun et al. 2019), this may be due to differences in sample collection and analysis methods, as there are currently no standardized methods for the detection and quantification of microplastics in water. Other factors, such as catchment size, population served, wastewater source (residential, commercial, or industrial), and treatment technology, may also contribute to variations in influent and effluent concentrations and treatment efficiencies.
According to available data on the microplastic removal efficiencies of WWTSs, standard wastewater treatment systems using primary and secondary treatment processes can effectively remove most microplastics from the effluent before it is released to receiving waters (WHO 2019). Sun et al. (2019) estimated that 50% to 98% of microplastics can be removed during primary treatment, which involves skimming processes and settling stages, with larger particles being preferentially removed. Secondary treatment, which typically involves biological treatment to remove organic compounds, can increase microplastic removal to approximately 86% to 99.8% of microplastics (Sun et al. 2019; Raju et al. 2018). The addition of tertiary treatment can lead to the removal of 98% to 99.8% of microplastics, but removal efficiency is dependent on the type of treatment technology used (Sun et al. 2019). Advanced technologies such as rapid-sand filters, membrane bioreactors, and dissolved-air flotation can remove 95% to 99.9% of microplastics greater than 20 µm (Lares et al. 2018; Talvitie et al. 2017). Mintenig et al. (2019) observed complete removal of microplastics >500 µm and 95% of microplastics <500 µm using tertiary filtration.
Given the large volumes of effluent water leaving a WWTS, even a small fraction of microplastics remaining in the effluent water after treatment can translate into high absolute numbers of particles being released to the environment (Murphy et al. 2016). Effluent discharges have therefore been identified as an important pathway for the entry of microplastics into freshwater sources (Murphy et al. 2016).
It is estimated that a single WWTS discharges an average of 2 million microplastic particles per day (Sun et al. 2019). In a study conducted at a WWTS near Vancouver, it was estimated that 32 to 97 million microplastics per day are discharged in effluent (Gies et al. 2018), with fibres and fragments being the most abundant microplastic in the effluent. The study also estimated that of the 1.76 trillion microplastic particles that enter the WWTS each year, 1.28 trillion settle into primary sludge, 360 billion exit in secondary sludge, and 30 billion pass into the secondary treatment effluent and are released into the environment, corresponding to up to 99% removal of microplastics in the WWTS.
The most frequent polymers in WWTS influent and effluent are polyester, PE, PET and PA, with fibres accounting for approximately 52.7% of the microplastics found in wastewater, which is likely attributable to the large amount of fibres released during domestic laundering (Sun et al. 2019). A study conducted by the Swedish Environmental Research Institute found that microfibres were the predominant type of microplastics found in sewage sludge from WWTSs, which is consistent with observations in other studies (Magnusson and Norén 2014; Mahon et al. 2017; Li et al. 2018a).
3.2 Sources to soil
Microplastics can enter terrestrial environments through plastic products used in agriculture, such as plastic seed casings, ground covers, and crop mulch. Land application of biosolids, plastic pollution, and poorly managed landfills are also significant sources of releases to soil (Alimi et al. 2018).
The settling stages of the wastewater treatment process result in the production of sewage sludge that contains large amounts of microplastics (Mahon et al. 2017). It is estimated that 99% of microplastics are removed from the influent but are retained in sewage sludge (Magnusson and Norén 2014) and that the properties of microplastics, such as their hydrophobicity and surface charge, can affect their accumulation in the solid phase (Murphy et al. 2016). However, the configuration of WWTSs differs, and thus removals from the influent vary from study to study (Novotna et al. 2019). Microplastics can therefore enter terrestrial environments through the application and use of sewage sludge as fertilizers for agriculture or landscaping purposes (Raju et al. 2018). In Europe and North America, around 50% of sewage sludge is recycled for use as fertilizer, and it is estimated that 44 to 300 kt of microplastics are added to farmlands in North America annually (Nizzetto et al. 2016).
3.3 Sources to air
Road traffic-related releases of particles from tire wear and tear may be an important source of microplastics to outdoor air (Kole et al. 2017; Prata 2018). Deposition and dispersion of these particles from the air may result in large accumulations of microplastics in water, and tire wear and tear is estimated to account for 5% to 10% of total microplastics in our oceans (Kole et al. 2017). Additional sources of microplastics in outdoor air are thought to include airplane tires, artificial turf, brake wear, thermoplastic road markings, waste incineration, construction, landfills, industrial emissions, and tumble dryer exhaust, although their relative contributions have not been well established (Dris et al. 2016; Magnusson et al. 2016; Kole et al. 2017; Prata 2018).
The primary source of microplastic particles in indoor air is thought to be the shedding of polymeric textile fibres from clothing, furniture, carpeting, and household goods due to wear and tear or abrasion (Sundt et al. 2014; Dris et al. 2016). For example, washing clothing made from synthetic materials has been shown to release microplastics into wastewater, and it is hypothesized that air- or tumble-drying these garments would also cause fragments to be transferred to indoor air, household dust or dryer lint (Wright and Kelly 2017; Prata 2018). Synthetic textile fibres have also been retrieved from a variety of surfaces, including outdoor surfaces, suggesting that clothing and other fabrics may be additional sources of microplastics in both outdoor and indoor air (Rauert et al. 2014; Dris et al. 2016; Prata 2018).
4. Environmental fate
This section reviews the available data on the fate of macroplastics and microplastics in three environmental compartments: water, soil, and air. It then discusses the persistence of plastics in the environment and the conditions under which they will break down (e.g., transition from macroplastics to microplastics). The fate of biodegradable plastics and bioplastics is also addressed.
The transport of plastic pollution often follows hydrological pathways (Windsor et al. 2019), with rivers being a key transport pathway (see Figure 3) (Alimi et al. 2018). From rivers, it is expected that the majority of plastic pollution will eventually be transported to the ocean. The mechanisms of transport are poorly understood, but are thought to be influenced by the shape, density, size, and surface condition (i.e., degree of weathering) of the plastic particle. It is also thought believed that the behaviour of macroplastics differs from microplastics since more energy would be required to transport larger plastics through an ecosystem even if the same transport mechanism is used (Windsor et al. 2019).
4.1 Degradation
Plastic degradation in the environment is slow and can be affected by multiple factors (Andrady 2015; Gewert et al. 2015). Plastics that are exposed to sunlight, oxidants, and physical stress over time will weather and degrade, although the extent of degradation depends on both the environment and the chemical composition of the plastic (Eubeler et al. 2010).
Owing to their chemical structure, common synthetic polymers are durable and can be resistant to degradation. However, there are multiple processes that can bring about the degradation of polymers. These include solar UV-induced photodegradation, thermo-oxidation, hydrolysis, and biodegradation (i.e., degradation by microorganisms). The most common polymers in the environment, such as PE, PP, PS and PVC, possess a carbon backbone that is resistant to biodegradation. Therefore, in order for biodegradation of these polymers to occur, an abiotic degradation step is needed to first break them down into smaller, lower molecular weight fragments (Gewert et al. 2015; Ng et al. 2018). Given that plastic degradation occurs primarily through exposure to sunlight, degradation is most intensive in environments such as the sea surface and beaches (Andrady 2015).
The first visual effects of polymer degradation are changes in colour and cracking of the surface (Gewert et al. 2015). Surface cracking causes the inside of the plastic material to be further available for degradation, eventually leading to embrittlement and physical breakdown upon exposure to abrasive or mechanical forces, such as wind, waves, and physical impacts (Gewert et al. 2015; Ng et al. 2018; SAPEA 2019). Over time, fragmentation can result in plastics no longer being visible in the environment (Selke et al. 2015).
It is important to note that several degradation pathways may take place simultaneously since various factors initiate degradation. For that reason, degradation products may be more diverse than those expected for any specific pathway. In the marine environment, most plastics degrade first at the polymer surface that is exposed and available for chemical or enzymatic attack. Microplastics have higher surface-to-volume ratios than macroplastics and therefore degrade faster than macroplastics, but the process is still slow (Andrady 2015).
There are numerous gaps in research on plastic degradation. To estimate biodegradation, many studies examine factors such as weight loss, decrease in tensile strength, visual disappearance, or the growth of different microorganisms (Zumstein et al. 2019).
Commercial plastics often include additives that, when released, may degrade to form other chemicals. In addition, additives such as stabilizers may enhance resistance to degradation. A study by Selke et al. (2015) evaluated the effect of biodegradation-promoting additives on the biodegradation of PE and PET in compost, landfill, and soil environments. They found that none of the additives significantly increased biodegradation in any of the conditions, and there was no evidence that these additives promoted or enhanced biodegradation of PE or PET polymers (Selke et al. 2015).
4.1.1 Biodegradable plastics and bioplastics
Biodegradable plastics and bioplastics have been suggested as alternatives to reduce the environmental burden of conventional plastics. Biodegradable plastics can be derived from petroleum or bio-based resources, whereas bioplastics are defined as polymers derived from biomass.
Biodegradable plastics have chemical functionalities on their backbone that render them more susceptible to conventional degradation mechanisms (hydrolysis, ultraviolet light) or to decomposition by living organisms (Ng et al. 2018). These organisms, such as fungi or bacteria, decompose biodegradable plastics either aerobically or anaerobically. Some types of biodegradable plastics will not mineralizeFootnote 2 unless they are exposed to temperatures above 50°C for long periods of time, conditions that are found in industrial composting facilities but rarely in the natural environment (UNEP 2015).
Bioplastics do not possess any inherent superiority to petroleum-based plastics (Vert et al. 2012) and do not necessarily biodegrade more readily than conventional plastics, despite the common perception that they do (European Commission 2019). However, there can be advantages to sourcing plastic feedstock from renewable materials, such as helping with decarbonization efforts or providing demand for residual biomass that exists in integrated agriculture and forestry sectors. A full life cycle assessment would be required to demonstrate whether or not bioplastics are preferable to conventional plastics from an environmental perspective (Vert at al. 2012).
Oxo-plastics are formulated using conventional polymers, such as PE and PS, with the addition of heat and UV-activated additives to accelerate their fragmentation into very small pieces. While it is expected that accelerated fragmentation would also accelerate degradation, the degree and speed of fragmentation are dependent on conditions that change from day to day and by location. Therefore, there is no conclusive evidence that accelerating fragmentation will enable degradation (European Commission 2018).
In landfills, the majority of plastics will not have direct access to oxygen. Little to no biodegradation of oxo-plastics is expected in deeper landfill layers. In the marine environment, there is insufficient evidence to prove that oxo-degradable plastics will biodegrade in a reasonable timeframe (European Commission 2018). Furthermore, fragmenting oxo-plastics will result in increasing concentrations of microplastics that are less likely to be recovered in clean-up exercises. Fragmented plastics are not likely to fully biodegrade, resulting in a direct contribution to microplastic pollution (UNEP 2015). Increased fragmentation may, however, lead to fewer cases of animal entanglement (European Commission 2018).
Biodegradable and compostable plastics are typically labelled with reference to a certification that outlines the criteria needed to achieve biodegradation (e.g., biodegradability in industrial compost). Nazareth et al. (2019) studied the biodegradation of these types of plastics outside of their intended waste stream. The authors performed a biodegradation study in seawater for six plastic samples labelled as either biodegradable or compostable. Plastic samples were randomly selected from supermarkets, restaurants, and stores in Canada, the United States, and Brazil. After 180 days, four of six plastic samples showed no signs of chemical or morphological changes. Only one sample showed both chemical and morphological changes and was largely degraded after the test period. Prior to this experiment, Lambert and Wagner (2017) identified the need to differentiate degradation pathways under different conditions. For instance, polylactic acid (PLA) is biodegradable in industrial composting facilities, but does not biodegrade under natural conditions.
Overall, there is no significant evidence that biodegradable plastics will fully degrade in a natural environment, and there is no conclusive evidence as to the beneficial effect of biodegradable plastics, including oxo-plastics, on the environment (European Commission 2018).
4.2 Fate in water
The proportion of plastics present in surface waters and sediments varies depending on the biological (e.g., attachment of bacteria/algae), physicochemical (e.g., plastic density), and hydrodynamic conditions (e.g., mixing of the water column) (Alimi et al. 2018). Factors such as wind, surface water circulation, temperature and salinity influence the distribution of microplastics (Zbyszewski et al. 2014; Corcoran et al. 2015; Anderson et al. 2016).
In the aquatic environment, the rate of degradation of plastics is temperature-dependant, with degradation proceeding more slowly in cold water (Andrady 2015). Plastics found below the photic zone in the water column degrade very slowly, resulting in high persistence of plastics in the aphotic zone, particularly at the seafloor. In addition, biodegradation of plastics by microorganisms is negligible because of the slow kinetics of biodegradation at sea and the limited oxygen supply for these processes (Andrady 2015).
A study by Leonas and Gorden (1993) looked at disintegration rates of LDPE, PS, and a 2% ethylene-carbon monoxide polymer, as well as other blends in aqueous media. The results showed that while the ethylene-carbon monoxide polymer disintegratedFootnote 3 more rapidly than the other films evaluated, the aqueous environment significantly delayed, if not inhibited, the degradation of the other polymers.
Biber et al. (2019) studied the deterioration of different plastics in air and seawater. Macro-sized pieces of PE, PS, PET, and a commercial material marketed as biodegradable plastic were exposed to environmental conditions in air and water. All materials deteriorated more slowly in seawater than in air, likely due to reduced exposure to light and thus reduced photooxidation in seawater. The authors found that PS showed the most rapid deterioration and is likely to break down into microplastics faster than the other materials evaluated, but that all materials tested did deteriorate to microplastics. Given the requirements for breakdown, it is expected that plastic items likely remain in seawater and that the formation of microplastics would occur in areas where plastic pollution is exposed to oxygen and UV radiation, such as intertidal habitats and at the water surface.
4.2.1 Sediment
Plastics may remain in benthic systems of lakes and rivers or be transferred along an altitudinal gradient towards marine ecosystems. As plastics move from source to sink, they interact with the physical, chemical, and biological environments in ways that depend on the characteristics of the plastics (e.g., density) (Windsor et al. 2019).
Besseling et al. (2019) found that microplastic concentrations on a volume basis are higher in sediments than in surface water. This can be explained by the settling of particles either as singular particles or in aggregated or fouled form. The authors also found that concentrations in beach sediments were higher than in subtidal sediments, which may be explained by the relatively low density of plastics compared to seawater, causing floating and suspended plastics to be washed ashore.
Sinking fecal matter from zooplankton that have ingested microplastics represents a mechanism by which floating plastics can be vertically transported away from surface waters and into deeper waters and the benthos, thus providing food for sediment-dwelling biota (Cole et al. 2016). Wieczorek et al. (2019) found that microplastics significantly altered the size, density, and sinking rates of zooplankton fecal pellets. In oceanic conditions, fecal pellets with reduced sinking velocities are more prone to consumption, fragmentation, and microbial degradation, resulting in their mineralization within the upper regions of the water column and therefore in reduced particulate organic matter export to deeper waters (Cole et al. 2016).
Fecal pellets containing microplastics that reside at the sea surface for a prolonged period are also more readily available for ingestion by other organisms, resulting in the trophic transfer of microplastics. Wieczorek et al. (2019) note that despite this, microplastics have been found in deep-sea sediments and benthic deep-sea organisms. Thus, an unknown proportion of microplastics are likely being transported to the seabed from fecal pellets where they become available to the benthos communities.
While sediment is largely expected to be a sink for macroplastics and microplastics (Eriksen et al. 2014; Woodall et al. 2014), there is significant mobilization and removal of microplastics in sediment during high flow events such as flooding (Hurley et al. 2018). Plastics in benthic sediments may be temporarily stored and remobilized by physical and biological processes. However, there is limited research on these mechanisms of plastic transport in aquatic systems (Windsor et al. 2019).
4.2.2 Impact of biofouling on aquatic distribution
Biofouling, also known as biofilm formation, is the coating of plastics with microorganisms, algae, or plants. This process can lead to a loss of buoyancy and thus promote the sinking of microplastics to the bottom of the water body (Weinstein et al. 2016; SAPEA 2019). It has been hypothesized that phytoplankton aggregates act as potential sinks for microplastics (Long et al. 2015). Kaiser et al. (2017) found that the sinking velocities of PS particles increased by 16% in estuarine water and 81% in marine water after a 6-week incubation period, which allowed for the particles to become coated with biofilms. The sinking of PE particles was not impacted by biofouling during 14 weeks of incubation in estuarine water, but in coastal water, their sinking velocity increased after 6 weeks. These results indicate that biofouling can enhance deposition of plastics to sediments and ocean beds (Kaiser et al. 2017). Further, Weinstein et al. (2016) indicated that biofilm formation on plastics decreases their UV transmittance, which could also inhibit the degradation of plastics in the environment.
4.3 Fate in soil
Although limited scientific information is available on the fate of plastics in the soil compartment, studies indicate that biodegradation can play a role in the fate of plastics in soil. Certain organisms, such as bacteria (Huerta Lwanga et al. 2018) or insect larvae (e.g., moths), can degrade plastics; however, this is not likely a relevant process in natural agroecosystems since they may not be naturally present in these environments (Ng et al. 2018). Alternatively, co-metabolism (i.e., the degradation of a compound in the presence of another compound used as a carbon source) is more likely to occur due to the abundance of carbon resources in soil (Ng et al. 2018).
The physicochemical state of plastics is also likely to be very dynamic in soil due to interactions with soil components, including organic matter (Ng et al. 2018). Interactions with certain pesticides can facilitate photodegradation or embrittlement of plastic particles (Schettini et al. 2014). As photo- and thermo-oxidative degradation pathways both rely on the combination of free radicals and oxygen, these processes only occur near or at the surface of soil (Ng et al. 2018).
In a study by Cosgrove et al. (2007), PU films were observed in soil at different organic carbon contents and different pH levels, and their fungal communities were compared. PU films appeared to be highly susceptible to biodegradation in soil and were degraded almost completely after 5 months (Cosgrove et al. 2007; Eubeler et al. 2010). In another study, biodegradation in compost was investigated for irradiated ethylene propylene copolymers, LDPE, and isotactic PP films (Eubeler et al. 2010). The results showed that degradation increased with increasing irradiation time; however, after 6 months of exposure, LDPE was still the slowest sample to be degraded as measured by weight loss (Eubeler et al. 2010). Ohtake et al. (1995) found no evidence of biodegradation for PS, PVC and urea formaldehyde resin that had been buried under soil for over 32 years. Another study found that a LDPE bottle buried in shallow soil under aerobic conditions for over 30 years underwent degradation on the surface, but the inner part was almost unchanged (Ohtake et al. 1996).
Following the release of microplastics to the terrestrial environment, particles can be transported to surface water bodies by wind and water erosion or dispersed through ingestion by organisms (Maaß et al. 2017; Hurley and Nizzetto 2018). There is also the potential for microplastics to leach into groundwater aquifers due to downward drainage from soils (Re 2018).
Soils are also expected to act as a major sink for plastic particles (Hurley and Nizzetto 2018). Microplastics are likely to be retained in soils for long periods of time due to factors such as vertical transport that draw the particles away from the surface, hindering degradation (Horton and Dixon 2017; Huerta Lwanga et al. 2017). Zubris and Richards (2005) studied fibres in soil as an indicator of the application of biosolids to land in the United States. The authors detected fibres in soil samples from field application sites up to 15 years after the application of sludge, and these data were corroborated with biosolids application records. Additionally, vertical transport of microplastics is possible via the movement of soil organisms (Huerta Lwanga et al. 2017; Maaß et al. 2017; Rillig et al. 2017) as well as agricultural processes (e.g., tilling), which can also cause physical damage to the particles (Ng et al. 2018).
4.4 Fate in air
Although research on the fate of microplastics in air is lacking, it is understood that air is likely an important pathway for the transport of microplastic particles (Dris et al. 2016).
When released into the atmosphere, microplastics can become suspended, or further transported, due to their light weight (Horton and Dixon 2017). Suspension and dispersion of particles in the air is dependent on factors such as the size, shape and density of a particle (lighter, less dense polymers can be carried more easily), wind conditions, and precipitation, which can facilitate deposition on land or water (Dris et al. 2016; Prata 2018).
Air currents and wind can transport particles long distances. Since air currents can be multidirectional, transport in air is less limited than transport in aquatic or terrestrial environments (Horton and Dixon 2017). For example, Allen et al. (2019) observed microplastic deposition in the French Pyrenees, a remote mountain catchment. Preliminary trajectory assessments showed that the microplastics had travelled up to 95 km from their source, indicating possible long-range transport. Microplastics have also been found in the Arctic Ocean in several studies. Lusher et al. (2015b) first reported the quantity of microplastics in surface and sub-surface Arctic polar waters. Subsequently, Bergmann et al. (2017) found large quantities of microplastics in Arctic deep-sea sediments, Kanhai et al. (2018) identified the abundance, distribution and composition of microplastics in sub-surface waters of the Arctic central basin, and Peeken et al. (2018) found microplastics in Arctic sea ice cores at five different locations and analyzed their content and composition. As with persistent organic pollutants, it is speculated that long-range atmospheric input of microplastics is one of several possible transport mechanisms (with others being prevailing currents and food-webs) to the remote Arctic Ocean (AMAP 2004; Kanhai et al. 2018; Peeken et al. 2018).
A number of studies have quantified microplastic presence in the atmosphere as well as in fallout (i.e., particles that settle on a filter during the sampling period). One study, for instance, observed atmospheric fallout of microplastics at a sampling site in a dense urban environment with a daily range of 2 to 355 particles/m2 (Dris et al. 2016). A previous study by Dris et al. (2015) measured a total atmospheric fallout of 29 to 280 particles/m2/day in the urban Greater Paris region. In Dongguan City, China, the concentrations of microplastics in atmospheric fallout samples collected from three sites over a period of 3 months were 31, 33, and 43 particles/m2/day (Cai et al. 2017). Three different polymer types were identified in the microplastic samples (PE, PP, and PS), and fibres were the predominant shape of the microplastics sampled. In the metropolitan region of Hamburg, a median microplastic fallout concentration of 136.5 to 512.0 particles/m2/day was found across six sampling sites over a 12-week sample collection period (Klein and Fischer 2019). Of the microplastics detected, 95% were fragments, with fibres making up the remaining 5%. During periods of higher rainfall, Dris et al. (2016) observed a higher number of fibres in atmospheric fallout; however, there were likely other temporal and mechanistic factors at play, which the authors did not identify.
In general, atmospheric concentrations of microplastics are likely to be correlated with population density, as human activities strongly influence the environmental release of microplastics. The fate and transport will depend on prevailing meteorological conditions, with long-range transport from urban source regions to remote locations highly probable.
5. Occurrence
This section reviews the available data on the occurrence of macroplastics and microplastics in the water, soil and air compartments, as well as in other matrices through which humans may be exposed to microplastics of environmental origin (namely food and drinking water). Occurrence in biota, with the exception of occurrence in food, is covered in Section 6. Where possible, Canadian occurrence data are presented. However, since Canadian occurrence data are often lacking, data from other areas around the world are also presented in many instances.
The absence of standardized methods and analytical techniques poses a significant challenge to quantifying microplastics in the environment. As a result, it is not possible to quantitatively characterize environmental or human exposure levels at this time. In light of these limitations and due to the small number of studies available, this report does not undertake a quantitative exposure assessment.
5.1 Environmental occurrence
5.1.1 Occurrence in the aquatic environment
Plastic pollution in the aquatic environment is summarized below with a focus on four compartments: shorelines, surface waters, benthic zone (i.e., the bottom of a water body) and groundwater. As there are no standardized procedures for quantifying microplastics in the environment, the focus was on studies that, where possible, applied practices such as the use of controls, use of appropriate and clean glassware, and application of contamination avoidance measures. For occurrence of microplastics on shorelines and in surface water, preference was given to studies in which microplastics were identified with an analytical method such as Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Raman spectroscopy, or pyrolysis gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GCMS). If any studies included in this report deviated from these criteria, it is explicitly mentioned in the text.
Shoreline
In an effort to remove litter from Canada’s shorelines, 21 300 cleanups have been organized by the Great Canadian Shoreline Cleanup (GCSC) across the country since 1994 (GCSC 2018a). Of the top 10 most common litter types collected during the 2018 Shoreline Cleanup, seven were either plastics or items containing plastic. Plastic items included cigarette butts, tiny plastics or foam, bottle caps, plastic bags, plastic bottles, straws, and food wrappers (GCSC 2018b). A total of 0.1 kt of litter was removed from Canadian shorelines in 2018 (GCSC 2018b). Figure 4 illustrates the contribution of plastics to shoreline litter collected during historical beach cleanup surveys of the Great Lakes.
It is worth noting that brittle plastic materials may break into smaller fragments during analysis, and broken pieces may be quantified as microplastics rather than macroplastics, thus affecting counts (Esiukova 2017). On the other hand, other methods of plastic quantification may underestimate the amount of microplastics, such as surveys on rocky shorelines. McWilliams et al. (2018) highlighted the need to further develop protocols and techniques to sample microplastics on rocky shores where marine litter may be caught between rocks and crevasses, thus increasing their lifetime on the shore. In addition, waves may grind macroplastics against rocky shores, accelerating their breakdown into microplastics. The authors conducted an accumulation survey of Fogo Island beach in Newfoundland and found that 82% of marine litter collected from the rocky beach surface consisted of plastics, with 67% of litter being smaller than 1 cm3.
McWilliams et al. (2018) also conducted a standing stock survey to assess the abundance of plastics at different depths of the beach on Fogo Island. This was done by first picking visible particles from the top layer of shoreline, followed by shovelling a 5 cm layer into a tray. Stratified sampling was performed to a depth of 20 cm. Across all layers, glass comprised 75.7% of litter, and plastics comprised 17.9%. More than 82% of the plastic particles sampled were macroplastics. Plastic particles were found throughout the different depths sampled, with the vast majority of smaller items found below the surface. Plastic particles below the surface were found to be smaller and more abundant than particles on the surface. The surface accumulation survey in conjunction with the standing stock survey provides insight into how many particles would be missed by a survey that only considers particles on the surface.
Proximity to industrial sources may be associated with higher concentrations of plastics (Zbyszewski et al. 2014; Zbyszewski and Corcoran 2011; Ballent et al. 2016; Driedger et al. 2015). Zbyszewski et al. (2014) collected samples along the shorelines of Lake Erie, Lake Huron and Lake St. Clair. Macroplastics and microplastics were found along all shorelines. Additionally, Zbyszewski and Corcoran (2011) found that along the shoreline of Lake Huron, pellets represented the majority of the plastic collected. Most of the collected industrial pellets were PE and PP that are similar to those produced by petrochemical companies. It should be noted that more than 94% of the total plastic pellets were found at one beach in Sarnia (Zbyszewski and Corcoran 2011).
Munier and Bendell (2018) visually identified and collected plastic pollution on the beach surface of Burrard Inlet in British Columbia. Of the 150 items collected, 144 were plastics, which were divided into 7 major user groups: bags, car/bike parts, everyday items, food associated, packaging, functional use, and children’s toys. The majority of the plastics were wastes related to food consumption, such as cups, straws and forks, and packaging.
Corcoran et al. (2015) collected 6172 plastic pieces from Humber Bay Park West beach on the northwest shoreline of Lake Ontario. Excluding polystyrene, which was only quantified by mass due to the large quantity collected, the plastics concentration was 21.8 items/m2, with industrial pellets being the most common type of plastic, followed by fragments. The majority of pellets and fragments had accumulated within organic matter along the strandline. Ballent et al. (2016) also examined the presence of microplastics in beach sediment along the shorelines of Lake Ontario. Unlike Corcoran et al. (2015), fragments were the predominant type of microplastic detected in beach sediment, followed by fibres. Beach sediment contained an average of 140 particles/kg dw.
In Lake Erie, Dean et al. (2018) collected 12 sediment samples from six beaches at the foreshore (between low- and high-water marks) and backshore (high-water mark to inland limit of beach). All samples contained microplastics, with a range of 50 to 146 particles/kg. Most of the backshore samples contained higher concentrations of microplastics than the foreshore samples. The dominant microplastic type was fibres, followed by fragments. It should be noted that although precautions were taken against the contamination of samples from microplastics during processing, some samples were stored or sampled in PET jars or PVC liners, and sometimes new and unopened plastic containers were used in the field without prior rinsing (Dean et al. 2018).
Single-use plastics are one of the most common types of macroplastics found on shorelines internationally. In Canada, 17% of collected shoreline litter consisted of plastic single-use food and beverage items (GCSC 2018b). Similarly, Earthwatch Europe (2018) found that single-use plastics are a significant category of plastic waste in European freshwater environments. The top 10 most prevalent macroplastics in European freshwater environments were plastic bottles (14% of identifiable plastic pollutants), food wrappers (12%), cigarette butts (9%), food takeout containers (6%), cotton bud sticks (5%), cups (4%), sanitary items (3%), smoking-related packaging (2%), plastic straws, stirrers and cutlery (1%), and plastic bags (1%) (Earthwatch Europe 2018). Cigarette butts rank high on both European and Canadian litter lists, with cigarette butts topping Canada’s 2018 Shoreline Cleanup for the highest abundance of litter and smoking-related litter making up 42.1% of the types of litter collected. In the northeast Atlantic, marine litter ranging from 2 to 30 cm was collected on beaches in the Azores, and plastic items accounted for 93% (26 321 items) of all litter. The collected litter consisted of 15.1% single-use items, 7.9% fishing-related items, and 71% fragments (Pieper et al. 2015). In the southern Caribbean, 42 585 litter items greater than 25 mm were collected at 10 locations on sandy beaches in Aruba. Of the litter collected, 89% (38 007 items) consisted of plastics. The collected litter was composed of 51% single-use plastics, of which 18% was bottle or container caps, 9% straws and 7% cigarettes. Additionally, 5% of all litter collected was fishing-related and 40% consisted of fragments of undiscernible origin (de Scisciolo et al. 2016).
In Canada, fishing-related litter made up only 1% of the litter collected in the 2018 Canadian Shoreline Cleanup (GCSC 2018b), whereas international levels show higher abundances in the water. Additionally, plastic items related to fishing activity make up a significant amount of plastic waste found on shorelines globally (Browne et al. 2010; Chen et al. 2019; PAME 2019). Fishing-related litter is especially significant in the Arctic, where most of the marine litter analyzed in the northern parts of Norway, the Barents Sea region, and the Arctic originate from fishing-related activities (Hallanger and Gabrielsen 2018). Fishing-related litter also accounted for 48% to 100% of the mass of litter on the beaches of Svalbard, Norway (PAME 2019). An average of 1040 plastic items/km were collected in Iceland, corresponding to an average of 104 kg/km that mostly originated from Icelandic fisheries (Kienitz 2013).
Plastics have been reported on shorelines around the world. Microplastics have been found on every Californian beach sampled by Horn et al. (2019), and fibres accounted for 95% of the microplastic items. Macroplastics have been found on beaches surveyed in Polynesia (Connors 2017) and on shorelines in East China (Chen et al. 2019). In China, microplastics were collected on beaches adjacent to the Bohai and Yellow Seas, where flakes were the most abundant type of plastic (Zhou et al. 2018). On surveyed South African beaches, industrial pellets were the most abundant type of plastic (Ryan et al. 2018). Typically, pellets enter the environment via accidental spills on land or at sea, and weather conditions play a factor in industrial pellet accumulation, as well as the presence of beached organic materials (e.g., woods, weeds) in which they may become entrapped (Corcoran et al. 2015; Ryan et al. 2018). Microplastics have also been collected on beaches along the southeast coast of India (Karthik et al. 2018). Finally, both macroplastics and microplastics are widely found in the Arctic, despite its distance from industrialized and highly populated areas (PAME 2019). Refer to Section A-1 of Appendix A for further data on the occurrence plastics on shorelines.
Surface water
Several studies have looked at microplastic occurrence in Canadian freshwater bodies, with a focus on the Great Lakes. According to Driedger et al. (2015), areas with greater human and industrial activity in the Great Lakes region are generally associated with a higher abundance of plastic pollution in the adjacent Great Lakes basins.
In the Government of Canada’s 2015 Science Summary on Microbeads (ECCC 2015), several publications reporting on the presence of microplastics in surface water were summarized. Building on this, a review of additional current literature on Canadian occurrence of microplastics in surface water is provided below.
Higher concentrations of plastics can be found near harbours or recreational areas and shipping routes (UNEP 2016). Hendrickson et al. (2018) studied microplastic occurrence in the surface waters of western Lake Superior. Sample sites were selected to include environments suspected to differ in microplastic distribution based on their proximity to presumed sources of microplastic pollution, such as WWTSs, urban shorelines and river outflows. On average, the estuary and harbour regions had the greatest abundance of microplastics, followed by open water sites and then nearshore sites. The average abundance for all sites was 37 000 particles/km2. Fibres were the most abundant type of particle, followed by fragments, films, beads, and foams.
Anderson et al. (2017) found microplastics in all surface water samples collected from Lake Winnipeg at densities ranging from 66 788 to 293 161 particles/km2. Microplastic densities in Lake Winnipeg were significantly higher than those reported for Lake Superior and Lake Huron, but were comparable to those of Lake Erie. There were no significant differences between nearshore and offshore sites. Fibres were the most common plastic type, whereas films and foams were the least common. In general, microfibres are one of the most common types of microplastic found in the aquatic environment. However, the distribution of microplastic type may also depend on the sample location as well as the method of quantification.
Globally, plastics have been reported in fresh and marine surface waters, and extensive research has been done in marine surface waters. Macroplastics have been found in the Adriatic Sea, where plastic bags constitute nearly one-third of floating macroplastics (Zeri et al. 2018). Foamed polystyrene items were the most frequently observed macroplastics surveyed in the South Pacific, North Pacific, South Atlantic, and Indian Oceans as well as around Australia (Eriksen et al. 2014). As plastic spreads throughout the world's oceans, it accumulates in subtropical gyres, such as the North Atlantic Subtropical Gyre and the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre, which is commonly referred to as the Great Pacific Garbage Patch (Eriksen et al. 2014; Poulain et al. 2019). Microplastics have also been found in Lake Michigan in the United States (Mason et al. 2016), in the Mediterranean Sea (de Haan et al. 2019) and in the Northwestern Pacific Ocean (Pan et al. 2019). Finally, macroplastics and microplastics have been found in Arctic surface water and in sea ice, and the majority of microplastics were fibres (Obbard et al. 2014; Lusher et al. 2015b; Peeken et al. 2018). Refer to Section A-2 of Appendix A for further data on plastic occurrence in surface waters.
Benthic zone
Microplastics have been reported in the benthic zone of Canadian waters. For example, in a study on the abundance and distribution of microplastics in surface sediments in Baynes Sound and Lambert Channel in British Columbia (Kazmiruk et al. 2018), microplastics were found to be abundant in the sediment samples from all sampling locations. Microbeads were the most common type of microplastic found, with a maximum of 25 368 beads/kg sediment sampled at one site, followed by fibres and fragments.
Ballent et al. (2016) quantified microplastics in Lake Ontario in nearshore, tributary, and beach sediment. Fragments and fibres were the dominant type of microplastic in the size range of less than 2 mm, and fragments and industrial pellets were the primary type of microplastic in the greater than 2 mm size range. Fibres were most abundant in nearshore samples, and pellets were present in all depositional environments, but not in sediment traps. Polyethylene was the most common type of polymer in the samples analyzed. The mean microplastic abundance was 760 particles/kg sediment. The highest abundances of microplastics were found in nearshore sediments, with 980 particles/kg dw, followed by tributary and beach sediments. Lake-bottom samples were also collected from Lake Ontario, with a total of 35 pieces being found in the two sample cores (Corcoran et al. 2015). No plastics were found in samples collected from depths greater than 8 cm.
Dean et al. (2018) examined microplastic occurrence in nearshore and tributary sediment along the shoreline of Lake Erie. Benthic sediment was sampled from Lake Erie nearshore locations, from the mouth of the Grand River, and from the Detroit River. Sediment samples were also collected from two northwestern Lake Erie tributaries and two northeastern tributaries. The concentration of microplastic particles in nearshore samples ranged from 0 to 391 particles/kg sediment, and fibres were the primary type of microplastic, followed by fragments. Tributary samples ranged from 10 to 462 particles/kg sediment with fragments dominating the samples, followed by fibres. A tributary sample from the Welland Canal, which is exposed to high shipping traffic and a sizable population, contained the largest concentration of microplastics. The passive sediment trap sample contained no microplastics, whereas the grab sample from the same location contained 390 particles/kg sediment (Dean et al. 2018).
Globally, plastics have been reported in marine sediment, where they are typically dominated by microplastics. Macroplastics have been found in sediment in Argentina and the United Kingdom, and the dominant type of plastic was packaging and wrappers (Browne et al. 2010; Blettler et al. 2017). Macroplastics and microplastics have also been found in sediment in Italy, with fibres being the most abundant type of microplastics (Fastelli et al. 2016). Similarly, fibres were the predominant type of microplastic found in Croatia and in the Arctic (Sundet et al. 2016; Blašković et al. 2017; Renzi et al. 2019). Microplastics found in river sediment in Shanghai consisted primarily of spheres, and the most dominant polymer was polypropylene, similar to the situation in Hungary and on Rameswaram Coral Island, along the southeast coast of India (Peng et al. 2018; Vidyasakar et al. 2018; Bordós et al. 2019). Plastics have been collected from the Spanish Mediterranean seafloor (García-Rivera et al. 2018), the Arctic seafloor (PAME 2019), and the Pacific Ocean's Mariana Trench (Morelle 2019). Refer to Section A-3 of Appendix A for further data on plastic occurrence in the benthic zone.
Groundwater
Groundwater is likely less vulnerable to microplastic pollution than surface waters (WHO 2019), although it has recently been hypothesized that microplastics from soils may be transported to and within aquifer systems (Re 2019). Currently, there is very little empirical data on the occurrence of microplastics in groundwater.
Mintenig et al. (2019) investigated the presence of microplastics in drinking water derived from groundwater sources in the northwest region of Germany. Groundwater (i.e., raw water) was supplied from wells at least 30 m in depth and microplastics over 20 µm were detected. Despite the use of very large volumes of water (1 000 L), very low microplastic concentrations were observed in groundwater, ranging from 0 to 0.007 particles/L, with a mean of 0.0007 particles/L. All identified microplastics were found to be small fragments between the sizes of 50 and 150 μm, with the predominant polymer types being polyester, PVC, PE, PA and epoxy resin.
A South African scoping study surveyed microplastics in groundwater from four boreholes in Potchefstroom (North West), South Africa (Bouwman et al. 2018). The mean microplastics concentration reported was 0.167 particles/L. From the microplastics identified, many of the fragments were in the lower size class range below 600 μm.
Panno et al. (2019) studied the occurrence of microplastics in springs and wells (<65 m) from two karst aquifers in the U.S. state of Illinois. Previous studies on the groundwater chemistry in these areas reported data suggesting input from septic effluent. The authors reported the presence of microplastics in 16 of the 17 water samples collected, with a median concentration of 6.4 particles/L and a maximum of 15.2 particles/L.
5.1.2 Occurrence in soil
The occurrence of plastics in soil is not as well studied as it is in water and sediment. Soil is an important environmental compartment in which to quantify microplastics as they may enter soils via plastic mulching or application of biosolids, among other sources. Given the lack of research on microplastic occurrence in soil, the criteria for selecting studies for this report were less stringent than for occurrence in surface waters.
In Germany, agricultural farmland was found to have 206 macroplastic pieces per hectare. The mean concentration of microplastics sized 1 to 5 mm was 0.34 particles/kg dry weight (dw) of soil (ranging from 0 to 1.25 particles/kg dw). The most common type of polymer for both macroplastics and microplastics was polyethylene (67.9% and 62.50%, respectively) (Piehl et al. 2018).
Liu et al. (2018) found plastics in farmland soil around the suburbs of Shanghai, China. Macroplastic particles sized 5 mm to 2 cm were found at a concentration of 6.75 items/kg in shallow soil (0 to 3 cm) and 3.25 items/kg in deep soils (3 to 6 cm). Microplastic concentrations were 78.0 items/kg in shallow soil and 62.5 items/kg in deep soil. In general, Liu et al. (2018) found that topsoil contained higher concentrations of larger sizes of plastic particles. Fibres, fragments and films were the most common types of plastics and the majority of all plastics collected were PP and PE. Zhang and Liu (2018) also explored microplastic occurrence in arable land in southwestern China. The study area consisted of two cropped areas at the upstream and estuary of the Chai River, as well as a buffer zone, which was converted from cropland in 2009 to host indigenous trees. Plastic particles were found in all samples, ranging from 7 100 to 42 960 particles/kg, much higher than the concentrations measured by Liu et al. (2018). In addition, most microplastics were less than 1 mm in size and the dominant type of microplastic was fibres, constituting an average of 92% of samples. During wastewater treatment processes, microplastics can settle in sewage sludge, which can then be transferred to agricultural soils and used as fertilizer (Corradini et al. 2019). Corradini et al. (2019) sampled 30 agricultural fields in Chile with similar soil chemical and physical characteristics, but with different sludge application records over the past 10 years. The authors found high concentrations of microplastics in the soil and reported that microplastics accumulate in the soils with successive sludge applications. Scheurer and Bigalke (2018) found microplastics at concentrations up to 55.5 mg/kg (593 particles/kg) in floodplain soil samples in Switzerland, with a mean concentration of 5 mg/kg. Macroplastics sized 5 mm to 2.5 cm were also found but in much lower concentrations.
5.1.3 Occurrence in air
Indoor air
Limited data are available on exposure to microplastics in the indoor environment. Only two studies were identified in which indoor air was sampled, and three studies were identified in which “fallout” from indoor air or settled dust (i.e., particles sampled from surfaces or vacuum cleaner bags) was collected. Generally, particles were examined and counted microscopically and characterized by size, shape, and composition. However, collection and analysis techniques varied, and therefore comparison between studies is not possible.
In the indoor environment, microplastics are more likely to occur in settled dust than in air, as they have a higher density than air (Henry et al. 2019). This route of exposure is particularly relevant to toddlers and young children, given behaviours such as crawling and hand-to-mouth activity. However, no data have been identified on partitioning of microplastics in indoor environments, and inhalation is therefore also considered a potential exposure route.
Dris et al. (2017) looked at fibres in indoor air, indoor fallout, and settled dust in two apartments and an office in urban Paris. They found that approximately 33% of the fibres were synthetic, including PA, PP and PE. The authors reported air concentrations of 1 to 60 fibres per m3 (median 5.4 fibres/m3), and dust concentrations of 190 to 670 fibres per mg. The method was limited to fibres greater than 50 µm in length. However, there was an inverse relationship between the number of fibres and their size, suggesting that smaller fibres could be present in larger numbers. Fibre concentrations in indoor air were significantly higher than in outdoor air.
Vianello et al. (2019) sampled indoor air in three apartments in Denmark and found that microplastics comprised 4% of the particles identified. The average number of microplastic particles in the samples was 9.3 per m3. Most (81%) of the microplastics were polyester; other polymers identified included PE, PP, and polyacrylonitrile (PAN). Both fibre and fragment shapes were observed, and the size limit for detection was 11 µm. Like Dris et al. (2017), Vianello et al. (2019) reported an inverse relationship between sample microplastic concentration and median of the size distribution.
Dust was examined from 39 homes in different locations across China (Liu et al. 2019a). PET was identified in all samples, and PC was found in 74% of samples. The method used could detect particles in the range of 50 to 2 000 µm; most microplastic particles were fibrous in shape. Synthetic polymers accounted for approximately 40% of the fibres collected, including polyester, PU, PA, PE, PP, and PAN. A concentration of 17 to 620 fibres per mg of dust was reported. The study authors also reported a concentration of PET in dust by mass (median of 27 µg per mg) and a concentration of PC in dust by mass (median of 0.005 µg per mg).
An earlier study (Schneider et al. 1996) looked at personal exposure to fibres at some European sites, using personal sampling pumps to collect airborne dust. The composition of fibres was not determined, but synthetic organic fibres may have included PE, PP, poly(vinyl alcohol), polyester, PA, and polytetrafluoroethylene.
Cox et al. (2019) did a crude estimate of inhalation exposure to microplastics using the air concentrations of fibres from Dris et al. (2017) and Tunahan Kaya et al. (2018) (see outdoor air exposure section), assuming 33% of the fibres and particles were actually microplastics (Dris et al. 2017). Similarly, Prata (2018) used the data from Gasperi et al. (2015) to estimate the number of airborne microplastics that could enter the human lung each day. However, as discussed above, no quantitative estimate of exposure to microplastics from indoor air and dust was conducted for this assessment due to the limited number of studies available, the very small sample sizes, and the varying techniques and criteria applied for sample collection and particle characterization.
Outdoor air
Only a few studies have investigated microplastics in outdoor air samples. The monitoring methods employ sampling techniques in which predetermined volumes of air are passed through filters onto which particles are collected. Confirmation of microplastic particles among other particles is then completed using traditional methods. There are no Canadian data available, but limited studies were conducted in Europe, Asia and the Middle East.
Dris et al. (2017) measured total fibre concentrations, including microplastic fibres, approximately 3 metres from the roof surface of an office building located roughly 10 km from the centre of Paris (four times throughout the year to account for seasonal variations). The concentration of fibres measured outdoors ranged between 0.3 and 1.5 fibres/m3 (median of 0.9 fibres/m3) and was significantly less than concentrations measured indoors within the office and at two residential sites in the same region. One sample collected on a rainy day in winter contained five times more fibres, suggesting that the rain caused fallout of the fibres. The methodology used in this study has a lower observation limit of 50 µm. However, the results revealed a more elevated number of particles in the smaller size fraction, suggesting that microplastics smaller than 50 µm could be present in greater numbers.
The concentration of suspended atmospheric microplastics (SAMPs) measured in Shanghai ranged from 0 to 4.18 SAMPs/m3 (mean of 1.42 SAMPs/m3) (Liu et al. 2019b). Microplastic fibres comprised 67% of the SAMPs, followed by fragments and granules (30% and 3%, respectively). The size and concentration of microplastics was shown to vary with altitude. The concentration of SAMPs was highest closer to the ground (1.7 metres), and lower at higher altitudes (33 and 80 metres). Larger sized particles (>5 000 µm) were also detected near ground level and not at higher altitudes. SAMPs were shown to represent 54% of the total particles collected and were comprised mostly of PET, PE, polyester and PAN. Poly(N-methyl acrylamide) (PAA) was the predominant SAMP at the highest altitude. It should be noted that rayon was included in the definition of SAMPs. Because this material is synthesized using cellulose, it is not always grouped with microplastics. This study estimates that the average adult in Shanghai inhales 21 microplastic particles per day.
The limited data on microplastics in outdoor air, measured in France and China, collectively identify an exposure level of approximately 1 microplastic particle per m3 of air. The primary exposure form is through microplastic fibres. However, there is significant uncertainty with regards to exposure to smaller microplastic particles, particularly those below 50 µm. In outdoor air, it is anticipated that most human inhalation exposures would occur near ground level and that concentrations would depend on many factors, including geographical proximity to outdoor microplastic sources, wind, temperature and precipitation (Prata 2018). Since people spend less time in outdoor or transit environments, they would be exposed to fewer microplastics outdoors than indoors.
5.2 Occurrence in food and drinking water
5.2.1 Occurrence in food
Current knowledge of the occurrence of microplastics in food is limited. The point sources of confirmed microplastics in food are currently unknown, although microplastics likely enter the food chain through plastic waste breaking down in environmental matrices, such as water and air. For example, animal species consumed by humans may ingest microplastics from aquatic environments or become exposed via trophic transfer of microplastics from prey to predator (EFSA 2016; Toussaint et al. 2019). It is also possible for ambient microplastics in the air to settle on food items (Catarino et al. 2018; Li et al. 2018a). In a number of microplastics occurrence studies, contamination of laboratory control blanks and test samples by background and/or ambient air microplastics was reported as a methodological challenge (Mathalon and Hill 2014; Lachenmeier et al. 2015).
Food manufacturing, processing, and handling, as well as food packaging materials, have also been suggested as potential point sources of microplastics in food (Karami et al. 2018; Oßmann et al. 2018; Schymanski et al. 2018). However, to date, there is no conclusive scientific evidence that food packaging materials, when used as intended (i.e., under normal conditions of use), are a source of microplastics in food or bottled water. Further studies are needed to determine whether food manufacturing, processing and/or handling, as well as food packaging materials, may contribute to microplastic concentrations in food.
The majority of available data on findings of microplastics in foods pertain to analyses conducted internationally and, unless otherwise stated, are not Canadian specific data. Most studies have focused on investigating microplastic content in seafood, specifically fish and shellfish harvested from non-Canadian marine environments (EFSA 2016; FAO 2017; Lusher et al. 2017; Barboza et al. 2018; Toussaint et al. 2019).
The available data for other animal species that may be consumed as part of the diet of Indigenous Peoples is summarized in Section 6. It is noted that the available research is limited to identifying macroplastics and microplastics from the perspective of animal health. It is not anticipated that consumption of gastrointestinal (GI) tracts, which would likely have the greatest amount of microplastics for marine mammals, fish and seabirds, is a major source of country food consumption. For example, according to the Inuit Health Survey, the most commonly consumed country foods include the flesh and organs of various mammals, birds and fish, but the survey does not indicate that the GI tract is usually consumed. There is a need for research to quantify the presence of microplastics in the animal tissues and organs that are typically consumed.
While some peer-reviewed studies report the presence of microplastics in certain foods, the particles were not confirmed as plastic, as the methodology employed relied on visual inspection or crude staining (Mathalon and Hill 2014; Desforges et al. 2015; Lachenmeiser et al. 2015; Liebezeit and Liebezeit 2013, 2014, 2015; Rochman et al. 2015; Wójcik-Fudalewska et al. 2016; Karlsson et al. 2017; Kosuth et al. 2018; Renzi et al. 2018). Given the lack of certainty that the particles reported in these studies are, in fact, microplastics, these results are not considered further in this report.
The available data on the occurrence of microplastics in food, including bottled water, are summarized below, with further details available in Appendix B.
Fish and shellfish
The presence of microplastics in the GI tract of over 150 fish species is well-documented, with microplastic content ranging in number from 0 to 20 microplastics per fish and ranging in size from 130 µm to 5 mm (Lusher et al. 2013; Campbell et al. 2017; EFSA 2016; FAO 2017; Barboza et al. 2018; Hantoro et al. 2019; Liboiron et al. 2018, 2019; Slootmaekers et al. 2019; Toussaint et al. 2019). There is significantly less information available on microplastic occurrence in fish muscle, which is the tissue of bony fish that is typically consumed (Karami et al. 2017a; Abbasi et al. 2018; Akhbarizadeh et al. 2018). The existing information indicates that microplastic concentrations in muscle tissue are lower than what has been reported in the GI tract of bony fish. The majority of dried fish muscle tissue samples purchased from local markets in Malaysia did not contain any microplastics, with concentrations ranging from 0 to 3 microplastics per fish (Karami et al. 2017a). Conversely, microplastics were detected in all analyzed fresh fish samples from the Persian Gulf, at concentrations ranging from 3.1 to 4.6 microplastics per fish (Abbasi et al. 2018) or 0.57 to 1.85 microplastics per gram of fish muscle tissue (Akhbarizadeh et al. 2018). Most microplastics were larger than 100 µm, with fragments and fibres being the predominant particle shapes in fish muscle tissue (Abbasi et al. 2018; Akhbarizadeh et al. 2018).
Microplastics have been detected in a number of edible species of molluscs, including mussels, clams, oysters, scallops, and snails (Barboza et al. 2018; Toussaint et al. 2019). The most commonly investigated species of molluscs is the blue mussel, which was found to contain 0 to 10 microplastics per individual mussel or 0.2 to 2.9 microplastics per gram of meat (De Witte et al. 2014; Van Cauwenberghe et al. 2015; Catarino et al. 2018; Li et al. 2015, 2018a; Toussaint et al. 2019; Van Cauwenberghe and Janssen 2014). Similar concentrations of microplastics have been reported in clams, oysters, scallops, and snails (Van Cauwenberghe and Janssen 2014; Li et al. 2015; Naji et al. 2018; Su et al. 2018; Hantoro et al. 2019). Fibres and fragments were the most commonly detected shape, ranging in size from 5 µm to up to 4.7 mm (EFSA 2016; FAO 2017; Catarino et al. 2018; Li et al. 2018a; Naji et al. 2018; Su et al. 2018). The concentration of microplastics detected in mussels varies; with higher concentrations of microplastics observed in the tissue of mussels harvested from waters with higher environmental concentrations of microplastics (EFSA 2016; Li et al. 2016b; FAO 2017; Hantoro et al. 2019).
Occurrence data on the presence of microplastics in crustaceans is extremely limited. The average microplastic content in green tiger prawns sampled from the Persian Gulf was 7.8 microplastics per individual (muscle tissue and exoskeleton combined), with filamentous fragments measuring 100 to 250 µm identified as the most abundant type of microplastic (Abbasi et al. 2018). Conversely, microplastics were observed in the digestive tract, head, and gills of whole brown shrimp, but not in the abdominal muscle tissue of peeled brown shrimp, sampled from the Clyde Sea (Devriese et al. 2015). Microplastics have also been found in the guts of lobsters at concentrations of up to 0.80 mg per individual, with fibres being the most frequently observed shape (Murray and Cowie 2011; Welden and Cowie 2016).
Other foods
The occurrence of microplastics has also been reported in a very small number of other foods, including honey, sugar, beer, and salt (EFSA 2016; Peixoto et al. 2019; Toussaint et al. 2019). One study reported that the majority of fibres in honey samples were naturally occurring cellulose fibres, with only a small portion of fibres confirmed to be PET by spectroscopy, but the number of PET fibres was not reported (Mühlschlegel et al. 2017). The remaining honey studies and all sugar and beer studies used a non-specific staining method to identify particles in the food items and thus, none of these particles could be confirmed as plastic (Liebezeit and Liebezeit 2013, 2014, 2015; Lachenmeier et al. 2015; Kosuth et al. 2018).
A recent review of microplastics in salt reported that their presence in commercial salts was common, although microplastic concentrations varied considerably depending on the origin and type of salt (Peixoto et al. 2019). Sea salts contained the highest concentrations of microplastics, ranging from 0 to 19 800 microplastics per kg of salt (Yang et al. 2015; Iñiguez et al. 2017; Karami et al. 2017b; Gündoğdu 2018; Kim et al. 2018; Renzi and Blašković 2018; Seth and Shriwastav 2018). Concentrations in lake and rock/well salts were much lower, ranging from 0 to 800 microplastics per kg of salt and 0 to 204 microplastics per kg of salt, respectively (Yang et al. 2015; Iñiguez et al. 2017; Karami et al. 2017b; Gündoğdu 2018; Kim et al. 2018). In most studies of salt, microplastics <500 µm accounted for the largest proportion of detected microplastics, with fragments and fibres being the most abundant microplastic shape, regardless of salt type (Yang et al. 2015; Iñiguez et al. 2017; Karami et al. 2017b; Gündoğdu 2018; Kim et al. 2018; Renzi and Blašković 2018; Seth and Shriwastav 2018).
Bottled water
A few studies have evaluated the occurrence of microplastics in bottled water (Wiesheu et al. 2016; Kosuth et al. 2018; Mason et al. 2018; Oßmann et al. 2018; Schymanski et al. 2018; Szeto et al. 2018; Zuccarello et al. 2019). In one study, microplastics were detected in 93% of bottled water samples purchased from 19 locations in nine countries outside of Canada, with an average concentration of 10.4 microplastics ≥100 µm/L (Mason et al. 2018). Similar results were observed in an unpublished Canadian bottled water study (Szeto et al. 2018). In both studies, the number of particles in the 6.5 to 100 µm size range were reported. However, spectroscopic analyses were not performed at this size range, and thus the particles could not be confirmed as plastic (Mason et al. 2018; Szeto et al. 2018).
Microplastic concentrations are reported to vary across bottle type (i.e., plastic, glass or cardboard) and intended use conditions (i.e., single-use versus multi-use bottles) (Oßmann et al. 2018; Schymanski et al. 2018). The highest concentrations of microplastics were reported in water from older multi-use plastic bottles, followed by glass bottles, newer multi-use plastic bottles, single-use plastic bottles, and cardboard boxes (Oßmann et al. 2018; Schymanski et al. 2018). Approximately 78% to 98% of the microplastics detected in bottled water samples were between 1 and 5 µm, with less than 7% of microplastics >10 µm (Oßmann et al. 2018). The point source of microplastics in bottled water is still unknown, and the variation in the reported microplastic concentrations does not seem to correlate with bottle type alone. This suggests that the origin of reported findings of some microplastics in bottled water may be environmental (i.e., from the source water and air as a result of secondary microplastics forming in the environment).
5.2.2 Occurrence in drinking water
A limited number of studies have measured microplastics in tap water, and even fewer are considered reliable due to concerns with quality assurance measures (WHO 2019). Average microplastic particle concentrations in tap water have been reported to range from 0.0007 to 628 particles/L (WHO 2019), and microplastics as small as 1 µm in size have been measured in drinking water (Pivokonsky et al. 2018). Due to the limitations of existing detection techniques, no information is available on the occurrence of particles below 1 µm in size. The most predominant polymer types detected were PET and PP in the form of fibres and fragments (WHO 2019).
In a WHO-commissioned review, Koelmans et al. (2019) reviewed 50 studies on microplastics in tap water, bottled water and freshwater. The majority of the studies were missing at least one of nine critical aspects of quality assurance (Koelmans et al. 2019). Specifically, the authors noted uncertainties with the concentrations reported in many of these studies and concluded that any information presented on the presence of microplastics in water must be interpreted with this knowledge. Relevant studies on microplastics in tap water and freshwater are summarized below. See section 5.2.1 for a review of relevant bottled water studies.
Pivokonsky et al. (2018) examined raw surface water and treated drinking water for microplastics from three drinking water treatment plants (DWTPs) in urban areas of the Czech Republic. Drinking water samples were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), FTIR and Raman spectroscopy. The results from this quantitative analysis indicated average concentrations of 338, 443 and 628 particles/L for drinking water at each of the respective DWTPs, with microplastics smaller than 10 μm accounting for up to 95% of particles retained. Although 12 different materials were identified, PET and PP were found to be the prevailing microplastics in treated water collected at two of the DWTPs, while PP and PE were most abundant in treated water collected at the third DWTP. Some of the limitations that may affect the overall quality and reliability of this dataset include the use of small sampling volumes and failure to take sufficient measures to control background contamination (i.e., wiping down surfaces and working under clean air conditions) (Koelmans et al. 2019).
Strand et al. (2018) did not find significant concentrations of microplastics in tap water sampled from 17 different locations across Denmark sourced by groundwater. Samples were visually examined by stereomicroscopy for all particles >100 µm displaying microplastic-like characteristics. Only a single sample concentration was reported above the level of detection (LoD) of 0.58 particles/L, at 0.6 particles/L. Chemical analysis by FTIR revealed that of the particles exhibiting microplastic properties, only 3% were confirmed to be microplastics, with the remainder identified as cellulose-like material (76%), as having poor spectra (10%), as having an unknown spectra (7%), or as protein-like material (4%). Polymer types were reported as PP, PS and PET. Given the very low level of each type of plastic polymer identified in the tap water samples, the authors caution against drawing conclusions on the origin of the plastic contamination. Additional tap water samples were collected to investigate the occurrence of smaller microplastics 10 to 100 µm, and chemical analyses were performed by FTIR. Only a single concentration of 0.8 particles/L was reported above the LoD of 0.3 particles/L, in the form of fragments comprised of PP, PET, acrylonitrile butadiene and PU. Despite the small sample volumes used in this study, the data presented was found to be among the most reliable studies on the occurrence of microplastics in drinking water (WHO 2019).
In a study on tap water derived from the purification of groundwater in northwestern Germany, Mintenig et al. (2019) investigated the abundance of microplastics at different locations within the drinking water supply chain. Particles were characterized using FTIR imaging, and microplastics down to a size of 20 μm were identified. Results indicated a low level of microplastic contamination of tap water derived from groundwater, with concentrations in both raw and drinking water ranging from 0 to 7 x 103 particles/L and a reported mean of 0.7 x 10-3 particles/L. Microplastic particles identified were small fragments between 50 and 150 μm in size, with the predominant polymer types identified being polyester, PVC, PE, PA and epoxy resin. Although this study lacks some aspects of quality assurance, such as the use of clean air conditions and absence of positive controls (Koelmans et al. 2019), when assessed on key quality control criteria, it was found to score the highest of all tap water studies by the WHO (WHO 2019).
Two studies (Uhl et al. 2018; Kosuth et al. 2018) were identified but not considered reliable due to uncertainty about whether the methods used could accurately identify particles as plastic. In one study, no particles were observed in treated or distributed water in 24 DWTPs in Norway (Uhl et al. 2018). In another study, Kosuth et al. (2018) evaluated synthetic particles in tap water from 14 countries across five continents and found particles in 81% of samples, with the most abundant type being fibres. Concentrations ranged from 0 to 61 particles/L, with an overall mean of 5.45 particles/L.
Finally, the possibility exists that microplastic contamination could occur at some point in the water supply chain as a result of abrasion of water pipes containing plastic materials, or from membrane filters made of polymers (Novotna et al. 2019). Further research is required to investigate this possibility.
5.2.3 Drinking water treatment
DWTPs provide a barrier against the introduction of waterborne microplastics in drinking water. The current literature, while limited, shows that drinking-water treatment can be effective at removing microplastics. However, given the lack of standardized methods for quantifying microplastics in water, further research is required in this area (Novotna et al. 2019).
Drinking water treatment typically occurs via clarification or membrane processes. Clarification processes are the most commonly used methods for removing particles from drinking water and involve techniques such as coagulation, flocculation, flotation, and/or filtration (Novotna et al. 2019). Membrane processes involve the use of diffusion membranes (e.g., reverse osmosis) or porous membranes (e.g., microfiltration, ultrafiltration). Diffusion membranes allow only dissolved substances (such as ions and specific dissolved substances) to pass through, whereas porous membranes allow only particles of a certain size to pass (Crittenden et al. 2012). As most observed microplastics are above the membrane size thresholds for porous membranes (i.e., 0.1, 0.01 and 0.001 µm for micro-, ultra- and nano-filtration respectively), porous membranes have the potential to be very effective at removing microplastics (Crittenden et al. 2012). For example, a laboratory study by Ma et al. (2018) found complete rejection of PE microplastics by an ultrafiltration membrane. The type of drinking water treatment process may affect the efficiency of DWTPs in removing microplastics. However, further research is required to inform drinking water treatment optimization for microplastics. Pivokonsky et al. (2018) observed microplastic removal rates of between 70% and 82% for three DWTPs employing conventional coagulation, clarification, and filtration. In a study using groundwater, Mintenig et al. (2019) found no significant difference between source water and treated water, although microplastic concentrations were very low in both source and treated water, varying from 0 to 0.007 particles/L (Mintenig et al. 2019).
Microplastic properties (e.g., size, shape, and surface properties), as well as water properties (e.g., pH and organic matter content) may also impact the efficiency of microplastic removal during different treatment processes. As microplastics are hydrophobic, adsorption of organic materials to the particles can occur, which can prevent their aggregation and thus make separation more difficult (Napper et al. 2015; Koelmans et al. 2016). Hydraulic forces can also break down large aggregates or particles themselves, creating smaller particles that may not be removed as easily during the clarification process (Jarvis et al. 2005). Ma et al. (2018) found that while pH and turbidity of the water had little effect on the microplastics removal efficiency, the microplastics themselves can actually influence the turbidity of water at sufficient concentrations.
6. Impacts on environmental health
This section reviews data on the effects of both macroplastics and microplastics on environmental receptors. Each subsection begins with discussion of occurrence in biota, followed by an overview of their effects. There are no standardized methods for testing the effects of microplastics. For the purposes of this report, the following criteria were used to select the studies: the study reported details of the analytical techniques, the study reported the type of plastic used (i.e., polymer, size, shape, virgin vs. aged), and the study monitored and reported measured concentrations that were similar to the nominal (i.e., theoretical) concentrations. Although it was found that preservatives or surfactants on plastics may be the cause of acute toxicity to organisms rather than the plastic particle itself, the washing of test particles is not currently standard practice, and this was not considered in the above criteria. Furthermore, studies were selected so as to cover a variety of organism types and effects.
6.1 Macroplastic
Plastic pollution can have various effects on organisms and their habitats, depending on the size and type of plastic, and the level of biological organization (Werner et al. 2016). In 2016, the Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) reported that a total of 817 marine species had been affected in some way by marine litter (CBD 2016), up 23% from the same assessment performed four years earlier. It also found that over 80% of this marine litter was plastic (CBD 2012, 2016). A literature review by Gall and Thompson (2015) of 340 publications involving 693 species found that plastic pollution accounted for 92% of the reported interactions between pollution and individuals globally.
Rochman et al. (2016) conducted an extensive literature review of primary publications (283 papers) on marine litter (including macro- and micro-sized plastic pollution) published through to 2013. The authors compiled the perceived and demonstrated effects of litter and sorted them by levels of biological organization: suborganism, organism, population and assemblage. Micro-sized litter (defined as <1 mm in this study) accounted for 71% of the demonstrated impacts, while macro-sized litter (defined as >1 mm in this study) accounted for 29%. A further breakdown of these effects by level of biological organization shows that of the demonstrated impacts from macro-sized litter, the majority were classified as suborganismal, with the most common effects being seen in tissues (e.g., inflammation or lacerations) and organ systems (e.g., poor functioning). Of the demonstrated impacts at the suborganismal level, 78% were due to micro-sized litter, 74% of which were caused solely by plastics. Other demonstrated effects include effects on cells (e.g., necrosis, viability), in organs (e.g., change in size, lesions) and macromolecules (e.g., protein, DNA damage). All of these demonstrated impacts of macro-sized litter were found to be from plastic pollution. The remaining demonstrated effects were divided between the organismal level and the ecological level. At the organismal level, the main effect observed was death to an individual, whereas at the ecological level, the main effect was on assemblages (i.e., change in abundance or diversity of biota). The most common items reported to cause an effect were lost and abandoned fishing gear or other plastic items, such as rope, bags, straws and degraded fragments.
The adverse effects of macroplastic pollution include entanglement, ingestion, and impacts on habitat integrity (Gall and Thompson 2015; Rochman et al. 2016; Werner et al. 2016).
6.1.1 Entanglement
Entanglement from macroplastics can occur from ropes, nets, cable ties, plastic bags, packaging bands and rings (such as for cans in bulk), and other string-like items (Werner et al. 2016). Observations of entanglement are reported more frequently than other impact pathways, likely due to its very visible nature (Werner et al. 2016). For example, Gall and Thompson (2015) found reported occurrences of entanglement for 30 896 individuals from 243 species. Of these reported cases, 79% were linked to direct harm or mortality, and the majority of these incidents involved plastic rope and netting. As well, Rochman et al. (2016) found that 29% of demonstrated impacts at the organismal level were caused by entanglement. The species most commonly impacted by entanglement events were marine invertebrates (75 species), seabirds (49 species), fish (27 species), and marine mammals (10 species).
Entanglement in the marine environment is often due to “ghost fishing,” which occurs when lost, abandoned, or discarded fishing gear continues to catch fish in the ocean or on the seafloor (Hallanger and Gabrielsen 2018; PAME 2019). In the Arctic, old fishing-related products were found entangled with dead seabirds, dead and living Svalbard reindeers (Rangifer tarandus platyrhynchus), and seals (Hallanger and Gabrielsen 2018). In addition, Page et al. (2004) found the entanglement rates of Australian sea lions (Neophoca cinerea) and New Zealand fur seals (Arctocephalus forsteri) to be 1.3% and 0.9%, respectively, in 2002. These are some of the highest reported entanglement rates for all seal species. The authors estimated that 1478 seals die from entanglement events each year in Australia. In one incident in 2018, at least five seals were entangled in a “ghost net” and drowned in the Fraser River in British Columbia (Rasmussen 2018). In addition, a review of global data by Ryan (2018) reported that a total of 265 bird species were reported to be entangled in discarded plastics or other synthetic materials. Fishing gear was determined to be the cause of entanglement in 83% of species.
Votier et al. (2011) examined the use of macroplastics as nesting material by northern gannets (Morus bassanus) in Grassholm, Wales and assessed the associated entanglement events. Nests contained an average of 469.9 g dw of plastic and the preferred material used was synthetic rope. The authors estimate that 65.6 birds were entangled on an annual basis, with the majority being full-grown nestlings.
Large plastics such as bags, sheets, and films can also cover plants, sponges, and corals, affecting gas exchange and their photosynthetic capacities (Werner et al. 2016). This phenomenon, known as “smothering,” can lead to mortality of affected vegetation (Kühn et al. 2015). Rochman et al. (2016) found that 8% of deaths at the organismal level were due to smothering when examining demonstrated effects. Smothering by plastic pollution can also lead to sublethal effects in these organisms. To study the effects of smothering on cold-water corals (Lophelia pertusa), Chapron et al. (2018) used 10 x 10 cm pieces of LDPE to represent fragments of plastic bags, which have been seen covering polyps in the field. They observed a decrease in growth rates from 3.59 mm/year in control aquaria conditions to 2.51 mm/year in the test group exposed to macroplastics. Although these findings are not statistically significant, the plastics may have acted as physical barriers to feeding, leading to impaired energy acquisition and slower growth rate. In addition, activity was 11% lower in coral exposed to macroplastics in comparison to control conditions after 7 days. However, activity was enhanced after 20 days, which the authors hypothesized to be a compensatory physiological response to enhance capture efficiency or a mechanism to cope with long-term low oxygen supply (Chapron et al. 2018). Macroplastic exposure also led to a noticeable decrease in feeding rates throughout the duration of the experiments.
Similarly, Qi et al. (2018) found that exposing soil to plastic films (1% w/w) had weak effects on the growth of wheat (Triticum aestivum). Plastic mulch films, comprised of 37.1% Pullulan (a polysaccharide), 44.6% PET and 18.3% polybutylene terephthalate (PBT), had stronger negative effects on wheat growth compared to the PE mulch. The authors note that this might be related to the presence of PET and PBT in the biodegradable mulch, which have been shown in previous studies to have stronger negative effects on soil-plant systems than LDPE (Qi et al. 2018). However, exposure to both types of films inhibited wheat growth with respect to plant height at day 40 and shoot biomass at 2 months. The plants in both biodegradable plastic mulch treatments also displayed fewer leaves, decreased leaf surface areas, and thinner stems.
6.1.2 Ingestion
Ingestion of plastics is another pathway that can lead to potential adverse effects. Ingestion of plastic can be intentional (e.g., where an organism eats the plastic, mistaking it for food), or unintentional (e.g., where predators feed on prey that have ingested plastics). Filter-feeding or detritus-feeding species are especially prone to unintentional plastic ingestion (Werner et al. 2016).
In the Mediterranean Sea, PE macroplastics were found in the gastrovascular cavity of 2 of 20 sampled jellyfish (Pelagia noctiluca) (Macali et al. 2018). Bernardini et al. (2018) also sampled 139 blue sharks (Prionace glauca) from the Mediterranean Sea. Blue sharks in the Mediterranean basin are categorized as a “Critically Endangered” species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Of the 95 adult blue sharks that were examined and had full stomachs, 24 contained plastic pollutants. Juveniles were also found to have a greater frequency of ingested plastics. In addition, macroplastics accounted for more than 70% of all plastic pieces. The majority of ingested plastic items were sheet-like (72.38%), followed by fragments (18.10%) and threadlike plastic items (5.71%), with the most common polymer found being PE.
The GI tracts of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), European flounder (Platichthys flesus), common dab (Limanda limanda), Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus), and Atlantic mackerel (Scomber scombrus) caught from the North Sea and Baltic Sea were sampled for plastics by Rummel et al. (2016). Of the 290 investigated fish, 16 contained plastics (approximately 74% microplastics and 26% macroplastics). Macroplastics and microplastics were found in the GI tracts of 47.7% of the coastal fish and 2.4% of the offshore fish collected from Scottish marine waters by Murphy et al. (2017), or 29.7% (n=63) of all fish sampled. The mean number of plastic pieces found per fish was 1.8, with polyamide being the most common polymer. Choy and Drazen (2013) also found plastics in the stomachs of 7 different species of pelagic fish from the central North Pacific Subtropical Gyre, many of which were macroplastics.
According to the Canadian Sea Turtle Network, almost 40% of leatherback turtles (Dermochelys coriacea) have been found to have plastics in their stomachs (Campbell 2018). Schuyler et al. (2014) conducted a global analysis of plastic ingestion in various sea turtle species and found that the most commonly ingested anthropogenic pollutants were plastics. Plot and Georges (2010) reported a field observation of an adult leatherback turtle that expulsed 2.6 kg of plastic pollutants, consisting primarily of plastic bags and plastic fragments. Plastics have also been found in green sea turtles (Chelonia mydas) (Özdilek et al. 2006; Stamper et al. 2009).
Lusher et al. (2015a) studied two adult and one juvenile True’s beaked whales (Mesoplodon mirus) that were found stranded on the coast of Ireland. Analysis of the contents of their stomachs and intestines revealed that both adults appeared to have ingested macroplastics, but it could not be determined whether the whales died as a direct consequence of plastic ingestion (Lusher et al. 2015a). Marine litter was also found in the stomachs and intestines of 26 out of the 175 (approximately 15%) dead Magellanic penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus) collected from the Brazilian coastal zone, roughly 58% of which was plastics (Brandão et al. 2011).
Several news articles have also reported occurrences of marine wildlife washing up on shore with plastics in their stomachs. For example, in Indonesia, a dead sperm whale washed ashore with nearly 6 kg of plastic waste in its stomach, including 115 plastic cups and 25 plastic bags (Times Colonist 2018). Examples of microplastics occurrence in a variety of other wildlife species, such as rough-toothed dolphin (Alesali and Lear 2019), sperm whale (Magra 2019), pilot whale (Zachos 2018), and harp seal (McKenzie 2018), have also been reported.
Gall and Thompson (2015) reported occurrences of marine litter ingestion for 13 110 individuals of 208 species, and Kühn et al. (2015) reported that the number of species known to ingest plastics increased by approximately 87% from 1997 to 2015 (177 to 331 species) and that marine litter ingestion has been recorded in 50.4% of marine mammal species, 40.4% of seabird species, and 100% of turtle species. However, cases of plastic ingestion leading to direct harm or death is less frequent in comparison to entanglement. Gall and Thompson (2015) found that only 4% of reported cases of ingestion resulted in direct harm or death. In contrast, Rochman et al. (2016) found that 63% of deaths were due to ingestion of marine litter. Specifically, demonstrated impacts from ingestion were observed in marine mammals (2 species), sea turtles (1 species), seabirds (1 species), and marine invertebrates (2 species).
Ingestion of plastics by organisms has been shown to have consequences from several pathways. Current literature shows that the most clear adverse effects from plastic ingestion is the blockage of intestinal systems, preventing feeding and thus leading to possible starvation. For example, a common dolphinfish (Coryphaena hippurus) caught in the Western Equatorial Atlantic had a large plastic bowl measuring 99.57 cm2 in its stomach (Menezes et al. 2019). Researchers suggested that the bowl was likely blocking its digestive tract, leading to starvation. A study by Pierce et al. (2004) reported plastic ingestion by a male northern gannet (Morus bassanus) and a female greater shearwater (Puffinus gravis). Both birds had blockages of the pylorus, which prevented feeding, leading to starvation and death. Ulcerations near the pylorus were also seen in the northern gannet, which matched up exactly with the shape of the bottle cap found in its esophagus that was thought to have been dislodged from the gizzard.
Ingested plastics can also damage organs and intestinal systems. Brandão et al. (2011) observed a dead Magellanic penguin (Spheniscus magellanicus) whose stomach had been perforated by a plastic straw. Jacobsen et al. (2010) studied two sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) post-mortem, both of which had netting, fishing line, and plastic pollutants such as bags in their stomachs. The cause of death in both whales was suspected to be gastric impaction, as one whale had a ruptured stomach and the other was emaciated. Stamper et al. (2009) observed an emaciated green sea turtle (Chelonia mydas) floating off the coast of a Florida beach. The turtle displayed signs of cachexia, lethargy, increased buoyancy, obstipation, and anorexia. Radiographs confirmed the presence of plastics in the GI tract, hindering regular function. After the removal of 74 foreign objects (including latex balloons, string, nylon rope, and soft and hard plastics) via enemas, the turtle showed improvements in its health, appetite, and behaviour. The authors note that this demonstrates a cause-and-effect relationship between plastic ingestion and morbidity in organisms (Stamper et al. 2009).
6.1.3 Habitat integrity and rafting (organism transport)
The presence of plastic pollution in water bodies can also pose potential problems for ecosystem function, biodiversity, and habitat integrity (Werner et al. 2016). An increasing amount of plastic pollution in surface waters has the potential to act as a stressor on ecosystem dynamics and habitat integrity (CBD 2012). Plastics can be effective transport mediums due to their potential for surface adhesion and to the low density of certain types of plastic and can potentially accentuate transport of organisms or other organic matter, a phenomenon known as “rafting” (Werner et al. 2016). This process can also occur with naturally occurring material such as wood, but the increasing prevalence of plastic pollution in surface waters increases the likelihood for organisms to be transported, which can pose a threat to the receiving environment. Gall and Thompson (2015) identified 34 reports of organisms rafting on marine litter, including packaging, fragments, and intact items (plastic or otherwise). Of the 259 total species described in these reports, 6 were listed as being invasive (i.e., non-native). However, the authors note that this is likely an underrepresentation (CBD 2012; Gall and Thompson 2015). The transport of non-native species is a particular concern, as they have the potential to negatively impact the structure of other well-established ecosystems by becoming predators to native species and/or outcompeting them for resources, leading to a loss of biodiversity (Werner et al. 2016). Non-native species could also transport diseases to which native species have not previously been exposed and could alter the genetic diversity in the ecosystem, which can have repercussions for generations to come. Furthermore, plastic pollutants can also act as an artificial habitat for the colonization and growth of microorganisms that can affect species assemblage (Werner et al. 2016).
Katsanevakis et al. (2007) studied the impacts of marine litter on the abundance and community structure of epibenthic megafauna in the Aegean Sea. They demonstrated that an increase in marine litter caused a marked and gradual increase in both the total abundance and number of species, changing the structure of the megafaunal community. This was attributed to the fact that the litter was able to provide refuge for mobile species and to act as a colonization site for hard-substratum sessile species. This change in dynamics can have significant long-term effects on the ecosystem, such as altered predator-prey dynamics.
6.2 Microplastic
6.2.1 Uptake, ingestion, and egestion
Microplastics have been found in many species, including invertebrates, fish, turtles, mammals, and birds. Given the lack of standardized methods for quantifying occurrence in biota as well as the limited data on occurrence in Canadian species, criteria for selecting reliable studies (e.g., studies that used an analytical method to identify microplastics) were identified but many studies did not meet these standards. Moving forward, it is recommended that a standardized method for quantifying microplastics in biota be developed.
A review by Provencher et al. (2017) showed that the literature on global macroplastic and microplastic ingestion in marine vertebrates is dominated by seabirds and that there is an increasing number of reports in fish, turtle and mammals each year. Fibres and fragments are the most common microplastic types found in organisms (Burns and Boxall 2018). For example, Beer et al. (2018) visually identified microplastics in 20% of the 814 fish they studied in the Baltic Sea, with 93% of these being fibres. Collicutt et al. (2019) determined by light microscopy that over 90% of the microplastics they found in juvenile Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tsawytscha) were fibrous in nature.
As in the case of macroplastics, several factors can affect the intake and ingestion of microplastics by organisms. In laboratory studies, Scherer et al. (2017) demonstrated that co-exposure of microplastics with algae significantly decreased ingestion of microplastics by Daphnia magna. Weber et al. (2018) demonstrated that exposure concentration and age of the freshwater amphipod Gammarus pulex affected its microplastic body burden. Feeding selectivity of biota is also thought to be a driving factor for microplastic ingestion: nonselective filter feeders are more prone to direct microplastic uptake, whereas more specialized feeders will uptake microplastics indirectly through ingestion by their prey (Scherer et al. 2018). Uptake of microplastics via prey ingestion is discussed further below. Select reported ingestion events are outlined below, with Canadian and global examples.
Liboiron et al. (2019) studied the GI tracts of three fish species commonly used for human consumption on the island of Newfoundland: Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and capelin (Mallotus villosus). The frequency of occurrence of macroplastic and microplastic ingestion by Atlantic salmon and capelin was 0% for specimens collected between 2015 and 2016 (a total of 419 fish). In Atlantic cod examined during the same period, the frequency of occurrence of plastic ingestion was 1.68%. These results are consistent with a previous study by Liboiron et al. (2018), in which 134 silver hake (Merluccius bilinearis) from the south coast of Newfoundland were studied and found to have a 0% frequency of occurrence of plastic ingestion.
In a study of microplastics in juvenile Chinook salmon on the east coast of Vancouver Island, Collicutt et al. (2019) found that 59% of the specimens examined contained at least one plastic particle, with an average of 1.15 microplastic pieces per individual. It should be noted that plastic identification was not confirmed using an analytical method other than visual identification using light microscopy.
In a study of microplastics in fish from a prairie creek downstream of a WWTS in Regina, Saskatchewan (Campbell et al. 2017), five species of fish were collected: fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas), northern pike (Esox lucius), white sucker (Catostomus commersoni), emerald shiner (Notropis atherinoides), and five-spine stickleback (Eucalia inconstans). Of the 181 fish sampled, 73.5% had between 1 and 20 microplastics in their GI tracts, ranging from 83.3% of the northern pike, an apex predator, to 50.0% of the fathead minnows. The number of microplastics varied significantly between the five species sampled. This inter-species variation is suspected to be attributable to differences in feeding habits. The northern pike, an apex predator, had the highest proportion of sampled fish with microplastics present in their GI tracts at 83.3%, while the fathead minnow had the lowest, at 50.0%. The authors acknowledge that characterization of plastics using spectroscopic identification methods was not performed in this study. However, a hot needle was used to test whether the suspected plastic particles melted, to confirm that the particle was plastic (Campbell et al. 2017). It should be noted that some types of plastic will not melt under these conditions (i.e., thermosets).
O’Hara et al. (2019) conducted a study on the seasonal variability of exposure of Cassin’s auklets (Ptychoramphus aleuticus) to microplastic pollution. Following a series of storm events, 707 carcasses were found on the beaches of Vancouver Island and Haida Gwaii in British Columbia. A total of 85 carcasses were collected for examination, and plastics were found in 40% of the birds. Macroplastic and microplastic pieces in the stomachs of the birds were visually identified and separated. The average number of plastic pieces ingested per bird was 1.6, with an average mass of 0.0085 g, and one outlier ingested 61 pieces of plastic. Furthermore, ingested plastics were predominantly microplastics (86.6%). There was no significant difference between the number of pieces ingested by age, sex, or health condition of the bird (O’Hara et al. 2019). Similarly, Poon et al. (2017) studied plastic ingestion by the northern fulmar (Fulmarus glacialis) in the Canadian high Arctic. None of the northern fulmars sampled in 2013 contained more than 0.1 g of plastics. Provencher et al. (2018c) demonstrated that northern fulmars excrete microplastics via their guano and found that the number of pieces of plastic in the gut was positively related to the number of microplastics in the guano.
Plastics have been identified in organisms from several regions of the world. Representative studies are presented below to demonstrate that microplastic ingestion by biota occurs globally. An exhaustive review has been conducted by Provencher et al. (2018a).
Microplastics have been found in gudgeons (Gobio gobio) in Flemish rivers in Belgium (Slootmaekers et al. 2019). Gudgeons from 15 rivers at 17 locations were sampled to study the occurrence of microplastics in their intestines. Microplastic contamination was found in four of the rivers studied. Of the 78 fish examined, 9% contained microplastic particles in their intestines, and only 1 fish had ingested more than 1 particle. A total of 16 suspected plastic particles were extracted from all sampled fish; however, only 8 particles were identified to be plastic following μ-FTIR analysis. Overall, 7 different polymers were identified: ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer, PP, PET, PVC, cellophane, polyvinyl acetate and PA (Slootmaekers et al. 2019).
In the heavily industrialized city of Tuticorin, India, Kumar et al. (2018) investigated the occurrence of microplastics in Indian mackerel (Rastrilliger kanagurta) and honeycomb grouper (Epinephalus merra) on the southeastern coast. Of the 40 fish sampled, 12 had plastic particles in their intestines. FTIR analysis revealed that the particles were PE and PP. Fibres constituted 80% of particles, whereas fragments constituted the remaining 20%.
While the ingestion of microplastics has been widely demonstrated, egestion has also been shown to be possible in some organisms. For example, Grigorakis et al. (2017) found that goldfish (Carassius auratus) have efficient gut clearance of microbeads and microfibres: the time required for 90% clearance was 33.4 hours. Mazurais et al. (2015) found complete egestion of PE microbeads from European seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax) larvae after 48 hours. In invertebrates, significant microplastic egestion was seen in studies by Chua et al. (2014), Blarer and Burkhardt-Holm (2016), Frydkjær et al. (2017), and Hämer et al. (2014). In Hyalella azteca, an amphipod crustacean, microplastic fibres were found to be more slowly egested than microbeads during acute exposure; however, both were able to be completely egested (Au et al. 2015).
6.2.2 Ecotoxicological effects
Despite the ability of some organisms to egest plastic particles, microplastics have been shown in the current literature to have adverse effects on organisms. In their respective literature reviews, Rochman et al. (2016) and the Joint Group of Experts on the Scientific Aspects of Marine Environmental Protection (GESAMP) (2016) reported that, in the laboratory, the effects from micro-sized litter (consisting primarily of plastic) were overwhelmingly seen at the suborganismal level. The predominant observed effects at this level were in macromolecules, cells, and tissues and can include inflammation and changes in gene expression (Rochman et al. 2016; GESAMP 2016). The remaining demonstrated effects were at the organismal level, primarily due to individual deaths (Rochman et al. 2016). In addition, Foley et al. (2018) conducted a meta-analysis of 43 papers published before October 2016 and observed that while effects from microplastic exposure were highly variable across taxa, the most consistently reported effect across both marine and freshwater taxa was a reduction in the consumption of natural prey. It should be noted, however, that effect studies do not have standards for testing particle size or concentration (Burns and Boxall 2018). Currently, concentrations of microplastics used in effect studies are much higher than those measured in the environment. Furthermore, effects studies focus on particle sizes much smaller than those currently sampled for in the environment (SAPEA 2019). Particle concentration can also influence toxicity, as higher concentrations are expected to overwhelm biological clearance mechanisms and cause responses that are not otherwise observed at lower doses (WHO 2019).
In the Government of Canada’s 2015 science summary on microbeads (ECCC 2015), 130 publications on the fate and effects of microplastics were examined and reviewed. Several key studies were summarized in the assessment report. The report noted a scarcity of information on long-term and multigenerational effects of microbeads; however, short-term and direct effects are well described. Physical effects were identified as the primary driver for effects to organisms. Some examples of effects in organisms from microbead exposure that have been described in literature include: decreased survival and fecundity (Lee et al. 2013), decreased reproduction from impedance of feeding behaviour (Cole et al. 2015), liver stress (Rochman et al. 2013), altered gene expression (Rochman et al. 2014), and possible genotoxicity in the form of DNA damage (Avio et al. 2015). Au et al. (2015) found that acute exposure to microfibres produced greater toxicity (due to physical effects) to Hyalella azteca than spherical beads, with 10-day median lethal concentration (LC50) values of 71.43 microfibres/mL and 4.64 x 104 microbeads/mL, respectively. Hämer et al. (2014) observed no impact on survival, growth, and intermolt duration in isopods (Idotea emarginata) following chronic exposure to microplastic particles of multiple forms. More detailed summaries of these studies can be found in ECCC (2015).
In its proposal for a restriction on intentionally added microplastics, the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) reviewed and summarized 25 influential scientific papers on the ecotoxicological effects of microplastics (ECHA 2019). The papers include data that overlap with those from studies cited in ECCC (2015). Experimental data cited by the ECHA in its proposal that were not discussed in ECCC (2015) are summarized briefly below. For more detailed summaries of these studies, please refer to ECHA (2019).
- Earthworms (Lumbricus terrestris) showed a decrease in growth rate with exposure to high concentrations of LDPE particles (<150 μm; 28, 45, 60% dw), but reproduction was not affected (Huerta Lwanga et al. 2016).
- Zebrafish (Danio rerio) exposed to PS microspheres (5 μm) exhibited inflammation, lipid accumulation in liver, oxidative stress, and altered metabolomics profiles (Lu et al. 2016).
- European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) feeding on PVC pellets (<0.3 mm; 1.4% bw) had significant structural damage to the intestine (Pedà et al. 2016).
- Daphnia magna that ingested PE particles (1 μm; 12.5 to 200 mg/L) experienced immobilization that increased with concentration and time following 96-hour exposure (Rehse et al. 2016).
- Pacific oysters (Crassostrea gigas) exposed to PS spheres (2 and 6 μm; 0.023 mg/L) had significant reductions in oocyte number, oocyte diameter, sperm velocity, and larval development of offspring following 2-month exposure (Sussarellu et al. 2016).
- Mussels (Mytilus edulis) and lugworms (Arenicola marina) exposed to PS microspheres (10 μm, 30 μm, 90 μm; 110 particles/mL seawater for mussels, 110 particles/g for lugworms) showed increased metabolism, but no adverse effects on energy allocation (Van Cauwenberghe et al. 2015).
- Common shore crabs (Carcinus maenas) feeding on PP microfibres (1 to 5 mm in length; 1% plastic) showed a decrease in food consumption rates over time and a drastic reduction in energy available for growth, with minimal lasting consequences (Watts et al. 2015).
- Marine worms (Arenicola marina) had reduced feeding activity and reduced available energy reserves from ingestion of unplasticized PVC treatments (130 μm mean diameter; 5% by weight) (Wright et al. 2013).
A review of additional current literature on ecotoxicological effects of microplastics is provided below for each environmental compartment of interest. Relevant studies are outlined in the sections below, with more detailed summaries provided in Appendix C, including information on the size, concentration and polymer type of the particles. Due to physicochemical similarities, information on primary microplastics was used as surrogate information where information on secondary microplastics was not readily available.
Water
The aquatic environment, and in particular marine organisms, has been the focus of much of the ecotoxicological research on plastics (SAPEA 2019). In freshwater studies, invertebrates have been the focus of research on sensitivity to microplastic exposure (Adam et al. 2019).
Studies on the effects of plastics on organisms in both freshwater and marine environments are presented below, by level of biological organization.
Vertebrates
Yin et al. (2018) exposed the fish species Sebastes schlegelii to PS spheres and observed a reduction in foraging time and swimming speed, an increase in shoaling behaviour, and a feeding time of almost twice that of the control. Goldfish (Carassius auratus) exposed to ethylene vinyl acetate fibres, PS fragments, and polyethylene acrylate pellets also exhibited sublethal effects such as weight loss, histological changes to the GI tract and intestines, inflammation of the liver, and physical damage to the jaw, including incisions from chewing fragmented particles, but no mortality (Jabeen et al. 2018).
Similarly, in zebrafish (Danio rerio) exposed to PA, PE, PP, and PVC microplastics, no significant difference in lethality was observed; however, microplastics caused intestinal damage such as cracking of villi and splitting of enterocytes (Lei et al. 2018b). A study by Qiao et al. (2019) had reported similar findings when using PS microplastics, such that zebrafish exposed to virgin PS beads had significant intestinal damage, inflammation, oxidative stress, and altered gut microbiomes.
At the molecular level, Qiang and Cheng (2019) found that exposure to PS microplastics induced upregulated expression of inflammation and oxidative stress-regulated genes in zebrafish larvae. S. schlegelii showed a significant reduction in crude protein and lipid contents and had black bile in their gallbladders, indicating gastrointestinal function disorder resulting from accumulation of PS spheres in their intestinal tract (Yin et al. 2018).
Conversely, several current studies report no significant effects on vertebrates for any of the endpoints measured. De Felice et al. (2018) exposed tadpoles of African clawed frog (Xenopus laevis) to PS microplastics and found no significant effects on mortality, body growth, or swimming activity during their early life stages, despite observing microplastics in the digestive tracts of all exposed tadpoles. Further, Ašmonaitė et al. (2018) observed no significant histological effects or inflammatory responses in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) exposed to PS microplastics, and Jacob et al. (2019) observed no effects on foraging or predation avoidance in coral-reef fish (Acanthurus triostegus) exposed to PS microbeads. Dietary exposure to PVC, PA, PE, and PS microplastics also did not affect stress responses, growth rate, or induce pathology changes in seabream (Sparus aurata) (Jovanović et al. 2018).
Invertebrates
In cladocerans (Daphnia spp.), increased microplastic concentrations led to increased mortality (Aljaibachi and Callaghan 2018; Martins and Guilhermino 2018; Pacheco et al. 2018). However, Jaikumar et al. (2018) suggest that mortality might also be temperature-dependent. Martins and Guilhermino (2018) further observed that microplastic exposure could have transgenerational effects in D. magna. Females descending from groups exposed to microspheres showed reduced growth, reproduction, and population growth rates up to the F3 generation, indicating that complete recovery from chronic exposure may take several generations for this species. Tang et al. (2019) found no mortality in Daphnia exposed to PS particles, but observed a reduction in body growth rate and increased transcription of arginine kinase and permease (enzymes involved in oxidative defence and energy production).
Freshwater crabs (Eriocheir sinensis) exposed to PS microspheres similarly showed a decrease in weight gain, reduced hepatosomatic index, and several biochemical effects, such as an increase in transcription of genes involved in the oxidative stress response and anti-inflammation pathways (Yu et al. 2018).
Similarly, Jeong et al. (2017) found that exposing the marine copepod Paracyclopina nana to PS microbeads increased antioxidant enzyme activity in a size-dependent manner. A previous study by Jeong et al. (2016) found similar results when studying the monogonont rotifer Brachionus koreanus: several antioxidant enzymes showed increased activity in rotifers exposed to PS microbeads, indicating a defence mechanism against oxidative stress.
Beiras et al. (2018) studied rotifers as well as the crustacean Tigriopus fulvus and determined lowest observed effect concentrations (LOECs) of 0.01 mg/L for rotifer immobility and 1.0 mg/L for rotifer and crustacean mortality, using PE particles.
For the freshwater invertebrate Gammarus pulex, Weber et al. (2018) found no significant effects on juvenile survival, development (molting), metabolism, or feeding activity following chronic exposure to PET. Another study by Redondo-Hasselerharm et al. (2018) exposed G. pulex to PS microplastics. While the survival of G. pulex was not affected, the organisms experienced a significant reduction in growth, with a 28-day EC10 (10% effect concentration) of 1.07% plastic weight in sediment dw.
Studies have also been conducted on coral species. Chapron et al. (2018) found that marine corals (Lophelia pertusa) exposed to LDPE microbeads had significantly lower prey capture rates and reduced skeletal growth rates and calcification compared to the controls. Hankins et al. (2018) found no significant effects on calcification in either the large polyp coral Montastraea cavernosa or the small polyp coral Orbicella faveolata despite active ingestion of PE microbeads.
Microplastic exposure has also been studied at early developmental stages for invertebrates. Lo and Chan (2018) found that larval and juvenile sea snails (Crepidula onyx) were not affected by exposure to environmentally-relevant concentrations of PS particles. At higher concentrations, the larvae grew slower and settled at a smaller size compared to control conditions. In addition, individuals exposed to microplastics only in their larval stages displayed slower growth rates even after the removal of the microparticles, indicating a possible legacy effect (Lo and Chan 2018). Similarly, blue mussel (Mytilus edulis) larvae with PS bead exposure experienced no changes in growth rate; however, there was an increase in the amount of abnormally developed larva (Rist et al. 2019). Beiras et al. (2018) found no significant effect on mussel embryonic development under static conditions from virgin PE microplastics.
Primary producers
Green algae (Chlorella pyrenoidosa) exposed to PS beads displayed inhibited growth rates that corresponded to increasing plastic concentration (Mao et al. 2018). Reduced photosynthetic activity and damaged cell membranes were also evident; however, a recovery of algal biomass and photosynthetic activity was seen during the later phases of growth, which may be linked to detoxification mechanisms. Additionally, Gambardella et al. (2018) found that green microalga (Dunaliella tertiolecta) exposed to PS microbeads experienced a dose-dependent inhibition of growth: inhibition reached 40% at the highest concentration.
Current studies also exist that show an absence of significant effects on primary producers for endpoints tested. Sjollema et al. (2016) exposed both freshwater and marine microalgal species to uncharged virgin PS microbeads and negatively-charged beads and found an absence of significant effects on photosynthesis from exposure to all treatments. Further, Garrido et al. (2019) found no effect on the daily growth rate of the microalgae Isochrysis galbana exposed to PE particles at any of the tested concentrations.
Soil
Experimental studies involving biota in the soil compartment are limited, but the studies that do exist show that microplastic exposure can negatively impact organism health and behaviour.
Ju et al. (2019) showed that exposing soil springtails (Folsomia candida) to PE microplastics for 28 days led to an increase in avoidance behaviours and an inhibition of reproduction rate by up to 70.2% at the highest exposure concentration. Additionally, the exposed springtails had significantly decreased bacterial diversity in their guts. Similarly, Kim and An (2019) found that microplastic infiltration into soil system bio-pores caused movement inhibition in the invertebrate Lobella sokamensis.
PS microplastics also caused toxicity to the soil invertebrate Caenorhabditis elegans following a 3-day exposure period (Lei et al. 2018a). Nematodes exposed to 1.0 µm PS particles had lower survival rates, shorter average lifespans, decreased average body lengths, and significant damage to GABAergic neurons in comparison to the other microplastic sizes tested.
Sediment
Although the sediment compartment has also been less studied than the water compartment, the current literature indicates that microplastics may have adverse effects on sediment-dwelling organisms.
Ziajahromi et al. (2018) exposed sediment-dwelling midge (Chironomus tepperi) larvae to four different size ranges of virgin PE microplastics to assess development. They concluded that midge survival was size-dependent; organisms exposed to microplastics that were similar in size to their normal food sources (10 to 27 µm) had a survival rate of 57% compared to 92% in the negative control group, as well as significantly smaller body sizes and head capsule lengths. Further, Leung and Chan (2018) found that PS microplastics significantly increased mortality and decreased body part regeneration in polychaetes (Perinereis aibuhitensis) after a 4-week exposure period in a size-dependent manner. In addition, sediment-dwelling bivalves (Ennucula tenuis, Abra nitida) exposed to fragmented PE microplastics in three size classes displayed a dose-dependent decrease in energy reserves; however, no significant mortality was observed (Bour et al. 2018). The exposed E. tenuis also had significantly lower lipid content for only one condition, while lower protein content was observed in A. nitida from exposure to the largest particles at all concentrations.
Nematodes (Caenorhabditis elegans) exposed to PA, PE, PP, and PVC microplastics had decreased survival rates, body length, and reproduction, as well as reduced calcium levels and increased expression of enzymes, indicating oxidative stress and intestinal damage (Lei et al. 2018b).
In contrast to the above-summarized research, the current literature also contains studies that show an absence of adverse effects on organisms exposed to microplastics in sediment. Redondo-Hasselerharm et al. (2018) observed no significant effects on survival or growth of the freshwater benthic macroinvertebrates Hyalella azteca, Asellus aquaticus, Sphaerium corneum, and Tubifex spp. from exposure to PS microplastics. Further, they observed no effects on the reproduction of the freshwater worm Lumbriculus variegatus.
6.2.3 Trophic transfer
There is limited information on the ability of microplastics to travel through different trophic levels, as seen in a food chain. Very few studies have looked at trophic transfer, and even fewer have studied the importance of bioconcentration, biomagnification, and bioaccumulation (Provencher et al. 2018a). Hammer et al. (2016) is one of the few studies that demonstrate vertical transfer of plastic particles within a food web. In that study, plastics found in the guts of great skuas (Stercorarius skua) from the Faroe Islands corresponded to the plastic contents of their prey (surface-feeding seabirds), implying indirect consumption.
Additionally, Cuthbert et al. (2019) demonstrated transference of microplastics in predatory midge larvae (Chaoborus flavicans) that consumed mosquito (Culex pipiens) larvae exposed to 2 µm PS microplastics. They found that the amount of microplastics transferred correlated with feeding rates towards mosquito larvae.
To study transfer along a natural food chain, Batel et al. (2016) exposed nauplii of the brine shrimp Artemia to microplastics ranging from 1 to 5 µm or from 10 to 20 µm, then fed the nauplii to zebrafish (Danio rerio). They observed that while the zebrafish were able to uptake the microplastic particles, no significant accumulation or further retention was observed within their intestinal tract, and no transfer to other organs was observed. Similarly, Welden et al. (2018) found by examination of stomach contents that trophic transfer of microplastics occurred between sand eels (Ammodytes tobianus) and their predator, plaice (Pleuronectes platessa) from the Celtic Sea. However, the microplastics were egested in the plaice.
Some studies suggest that unintentional ingestion, rather than trophic transfer, is the primary means by which microplastics are ingested. Chagnon et al. (2018) found no accumulation of microplastics in stomachs of yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares), a large predatory fish from Easter Island, despite plastics being found in the guts of its prey. Hipfner et al. (2018) also concluded that two fish species from the northeastern Pacific Ocean, the Pacific sand lance (Ammodytes personatus) and the Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii), do not act as significant conduits for the vertical transfer of microfibres to marine piscivores along the coast of British Columbia.
6.2.4 Translocation
While mechanisms of translocation from an organism’s gut to other parts of its body are not well studied to date, the current literature has shown that translocation is usually size-dependent. For example, Lu et al. (2016) found that particles <5 μm can translocate to fish liver from the gut, while 20 µm particles cannot (Jovanović 2017). Smaller particles have the potential to more easily enter the circulatory system, but can also be egested more easily than larger microplastic particles (Jovanović 2017; Burns and Boxall 2018).
Current studies show that translocation occurs in some organisms and organs, while other studies contradict these findings. For example, translocation of 0.5 μm PS spheres to the haemolymph, gills, and ovary was observed in crabs (Carcinus maenas) (Farrell and Nelson 2013). In zebrafish (Danio rerio), Lu et al. (2016) found 5 μm PS particles in the gills, liver, and gut, while 20 μm particles were only found in the gills and gut. In bivalves, tissue translocation of 3.0 or 9.6 μm PS spheres from the digestive tract to the circulatory system was seen in mussels (Mytilus edulis) by Browne et al. (2008). However, a study by Sussarellu et al. (2016) using Pacific oysters (Crassostrea gigas) showed no evidence of PS sphere (2 and 6 μm) translocation. Limited information in fish also shows very small amounts of microplastics in fish muscle (Karami et al. 2017a; Abbasi et al. 2018; Akhbarizadeh et al. 2018).
The conflicting results observed in these studies may be attributable to species-specific differences and/or false positive results that may occur as a result of leaching of fluorescent dye, which is often used to track particle ingestion. Schür et al. (2019) tested this theory and found that fluorescent droplets did not always co-localize with the plastic PS beads ingested by Daphnia magna. Using confocal laser scanning microscopy, 1 µm beads did not co-localize with the fluorescent dye in the gut and there was a rapid loss of fluorescence upon investigation. Fluorescence was also observed in lipid droplets outside of the digestive tract, but plastic particles were not detected in these same lipid droplets. Therefore, given that false positives may occur in uptake studies that did not take precautions to avoid potential artifacts by ensuring the stability of dyes, controlling for dye leaching (e.g., by pre-washing the particles), or using microscopic imaging to confirm plastic presence, results should be interpreted with caution.
7. Impacts on human health
7.1 Macroplastic
Human exposure to macroplastic pollution is not anticipated to occur, and the effects of macroplastics on human health are therefore not considered in this report.
7.2 Microplastic
Humans may be exposed to microplastics through the ingestion of food and drinking water (see Section 5.2) and the inhalation of indoor and outdoor air (see Section 5.1.3). The toxicity of microplastics via the ingestion and inhalation routes of exposure is reviewed below. Where possible, inferences are made from epidemiological studies on microplastics in humans and experimental studies on microplastics in animal models. A comprehensive review of in vitro studies on microplastics was not conducted as their relevance to human health is unclear. The effects of biofilms on human health are also discussed.
Upon ingestion or inhalation, microplastics may exert effects due either to their physical presence in the gut or lung or to the chemical composition of the plastic polymers themselves or their monomers, additives or sorbed substances. The World Health Organization (WHO) recently carried out an assessment of human exposure to microplastics in drinking water using conservative worst-case estimates of the levels of additives and sorbed chemicals on microplastics (WHO 2019). The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) conducted a similar assessment of exposure to microplastics in seafood (EFSA 2016; FAO 2017). These evaluations concluded that exposure to microplastics and/or chemicals associated with microplastics are considered to be a low concern to human health (EFSA 2016; FAO 2017; WHO 2019). The reader is referred to those reports for further information on the exposure and risk assessments conducted therein.
7.2.1 Effects from oral exposure
Physicochemical properties affecting uptake and toxicity
Following ingestion, microplastic uptake and translocation are strongly dependent on the physicochemical properties of the ingested particles (FAO 2017; Wright and Kelly 2017; WHO 2019). Particle size is an important determinant of absorption through the intestinal epithelium. Smaller particles have larger surface-area-to-volume ratios, which can increase their ability to translocate to internal organs and increase bioreactivity (WHO 2019). A higher surface-area-to-volume ratio may also increase the sorption capacity of microplastics for environmental contaminants. Smaller particles may also be more susceptible to fragmentation, and while degradation of microplastics to smaller polymers has been demonstrated for Antarctic krill, it is uncertain whether this occurs within the human GI tract (WHO 2019). Particle concentration can also influence toxicity, as higher concentrations are expected to overwhelm biological clearance mechanisms and cause responses that are otherwise not observed at lower doses (WHO 2019). At present, it is unclear how other properties, such as shape and surface chemistry, may affect the uptake, retention, and/or toxicity of ingested microplastics (Stock et al. 2019; WHO 2019).
Toxicokinetics
There are limited data regarding the fate of orally ingested microplastics in mammalian species. After oral ingestion, microplastics may accumulate in the gastrointestinal tract, translocate from the gastrointestinal tract into organs or tissues, or be excreted (Carr et al. 2012; Galloway 2015; Duis and Coors 2016).
Several mechanisms of uptake have been proposed for microplastics, including endocytosis via microfold cells (M cells) of the intestinal Peyer’s patches and paracellular persorption (see EFSA 2016, FAO 2017, and Wright and Kelly 2017 for an extensive review of the toxicokinetics of microplastics). Based on limited data, it is expected that the largest fraction of orally ingested microplastics (>90%) will be excreted in the feces (EFSA 2016; FAO 2017). Microplastics greater than 150 µm are also expected to remain confined to the gut lumen and be excreted (EFSA 2016; FAO 2017; WHO 2019). Various types of microparticles have been shown to translocate across the mammalian GI tract into the lymphatic system at sizes ranging from 0.1 to 150 µm (Hussain et al. 2001; EFSA 2016; FAO 2017). For example, in one study, PVC microplastics (5 to 110 µm) were detected in the portal veins of dogs (Volkheimer 1975). Given these findings, it is expected that microplastics ≤150 µm will end up in the lymph nodes and may result in systemic exposure, although absorption is expected to be low (≤ 0.3%; EFSA 2016; FAO 2017). Only very small microplastics (˂1.5 µm) are expected to enter into capillaries and penetrate deeply into tissues (Yoo et al. 2011; EFSA 2016). This is consistent with a recent 28-day study in which mice were administered high concentrations of a mixture of PS microplastics of various sizes by oral gavage 3 times per week (Stock et al. 2019). Only a few microplastics were detected in the intestinal walls (no quantitative analysis completed), representing a very low uptake by the GI tissue, and no microplastics were found in the liver, spleen or kidney. Conversely, another study reported significant translocation of 5 µm and 20 µm PS microplastics to the liver and kidney in mice (Deng et al. 2017), although these data are of questionable quality due to notable limitations in study design, data reporting, and biological plausibility of results (Tang 2017; Böhmert et al. 2019; Braeuning 2019). Based on a single human ex vivo placental perfusion model, fluorescently-labelled polystyrene beads <240 nm may be taken up by the placenta (Wick et al. 2010).
Studies in humans
No epidemiological or controlled dose studies that evaluated the effects of orally ingested microplastics were identified in humans.
Studies in experimental animals
A small number of animal studies have evaluated the potential adverse effects of orally ingested microplastics (Merski et al. 2008; Mahler et al. 2012; Deng et al. 2017, 2018; Lu et al. 2018; Rafiee et al. 2018; Jin et al. 2019; Stock et al. 2019). Studies were limited to a few types of virgin microplastics and tested either unknown or high concentrations of microplastics that were not necessarily reflective of anticipated human exposure. Test concentrations in toxicity studies are orders of magnitude higher than would be anticipated for humans. Therefore, it was not possible to adequately evaluate the health risk of orally ingested microplastics with the currently available animal data (EFSA 2016; FAO 2017; Wright and Kelly 2017; WHO 2019). The WHO conducted the most recent review of the toxicological data on microplastics ingestion. Consistent with previous reviews by the EFSA (2016) and FAO (2017), the WHO concluded that there were insufficient data to allow for a robust evaluation of the potential human health risks of ingested microplastics, although there was no information to suggest it represented a potential human health concern (WHO 2019). Relevant toxicological studies are briefly summarized below, with more detailed descriptions, including test concentrations, provided in Table D-1 in Appendix D.
In a 90-day study that was compliant with test methods from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), rats fed a daily diet that contained up to 5% milled PE and PET fabric exhibited no treatment-related adverse effects on blood parameters, organ weights, or histopathology (Merski et al. 2008). Based on the absence of observed toxicity, the highest test dose was considered to be the no observed effect level (NOEL), equivalent to approximately 2 500 mg/kg body weight (bw)/day (WHO 2019). Fibre concentrations were not reported.
Other studies have reported adverse health effects in mice following the administration of very high oral doses of microplastics, several orders of magnitude above expected microplastic concentrations in food and drinking water (Deng et al. 2017, 2018; Lu et al. 2018; Jin et al. 2019). These studies have been extensively criticized for their lack of reliability and relevance (Böhmert et al. 2019; Braeuning 2019; Tang 2017; WHO 2019; Stock et al. 2019). Exposure to high concentrations of PS microplastics in drinking water was associated with alterations in lipid metabolism, gut microbiota composition, amino acid and bile acid metabolism, mucus secretion, and reduced intestinal barrier function in mice (Jin et al. 2019; Lu et al. 2018). Inflammation and lipid droplets were reported in the livers of mice administered high concentrations of PS microplastics by gavage (Deng et al. 2017), but the presence of these effects cannot be determined due to poor quality histological images (Braeuning 2019). Deng et al. (2017) also reported changes in metabolic profiles suggestive of disturbances in energy and lipid metabolism, oxidative stress, and neurotoxic responses. However, the relevance of these metabolic endpoints in assessing the potential human health effects of microplastics is difficult to interpret (Tang 2017; Braeuning 2019; WHO 2019).
More recently, a 28-day mouse study evaluated the potential adverse effects of a mixture of various sizes of PS microplastics (1, 4 and 10 µm) administered via oral gavage 3 times per week using male heme oxygenase-1 reporter mice, a transgenic mouse model used to evaluate oxidative stress and inflammatory responses (Stock et al. 2019). In contrast to previous studies (Deng et al. 2017, 2018), the authors reported no evidence of oxidative stress or inflammation. While very high microplastic doses were selected for purposes of consistency with other rodent oral toxicity studies, the selected treatment scheme involved dosing the animals 3 times per week, which was intended to be more representative of a realistic human exposure scenario. However, given the high level of uncertainty surrounding human exposure to microplastics, it is unclear whether this experimental dosing regime (i.e., 3 times per week) was in fact more representative of human exposure than daily dosing regimes.
7.2.2 Effects from inhalation
There may be hazards associated with the inhalation of microplastic particles due to their physical presence in the lung that are independent of chemical-related hazards. The scientific literature demonstrating the specific effects of microplastics on the lung is emerging, but their potential to cause effects in the respiratory tract or to translocate to other tissues remains uncertain. Still, inferences can be made from concepts of particle toxicology. Overall, toxicity related to the physical hazard of particles can include oxidative stress, cytotoxicity, inflammation, translocation to other tissues and, in some exceptionally elevated exposure circumstances, particle overload (elevated alveolar burden of particles that can impair clearance) (Prata 2018). Poorly soluble particles that are not inherently toxic, such as carbon black and TiO2, have been shown to cause inflammation and tumours in rodents, albeit at very elevated levels of exposure (Borm and Driscoll 2019). Inhalation of fine particles is also associated with adverse respiratory and cardiovascular effects, although it is not possible to draw any conclusions regarding particle-driven effects of microplastics exposure at this time.
Potential toxicity of particles will largely depend on particle size and shape, which will influence their deposition in the respiratory tract, their interaction with biological matrices, their potential to translocate, and the efficiency of particle clearance mechanisms. In general, inhalable particles larger than 10 µm in aerodynamic equivalent size will deposit mostly in the extrathoracic region, whereas particles below 10 µm can reach the tracheobronchial regions of the lung (US EPA 2009). It is expected that the majority of these particles will be removed from the airways by means of mucociliary clearance (i.e., trapping of the particles in mucus and coughing), though such clearance can result in ingestion of the particles and subsequent gastrointestinal exposure (Gasperi et al. 2018). In theory, small particles below 2.5 µm in size can reach the alveolar region of the lung. These particles are removed through phagocytosis by alveolar macrophages, although there is some conflicting evidence demonstrating that very small particles in the nano-size range can evade alveolar clearance mechanisms and potentially accumulate in the lung, eventually reaching the interstitium (Li et al. 2016a).
In the case of fibres, deposition patterns are more difficult to predict. Given their length, most microplastic fibres are expected to be deposited either in the extrathoracic region or in the upper airways and removed via mucociliary clearance (Gasperi et al. 2018). In general, longer plastic fibres, although flexible, are more likely to be associated with evasion of clearance mechanisms (Prata 2018). The area in which deposition occurs and residency time in the lung will greatly influence physical hazards associated with microfibres. Although there are insufficient data that are specific to microplastics, the observation of plastic microfibres in lung tissue biopsies of workers from a synthetic textile industry, as well as in healthy and neoplastic lung tissues from lung cancer patients, substantiates the plausibility of pulmonary microplastic retention through inhalation (Pauly et al. 1998; Wright and Kelly 2017).
There are few studies that evaluate microplastic particle translocation from the lung following inhalation. It is possible that microplastics can translocate from the lung to systemic circulation or to the lymphatic system, potentially reaching other tissues. One study has examined translocation following intratracheal instillation in pregnant rats (equivalent to 2.4 x 1013 particles) and revealed systemic translocation to placenta, whole pup, fetal liver, heart and spleen (Fournier et al. 2018). Rats intratracheally instilled with radiolabelled PS particles of 56.4 and 202 nm in size exhibited only a small fraction (<2.5%) of particle translocation into systemic circulation in healthy rats, which increased to 4.7% for the smaller particles in the presence of lipopolysaccharide-induced lung inflammation (Chen et al. 2006). The likelihood of translocation is expected to increase with decreasing particle size and increased residency time as well as in individuals with compromised lung function and during events of inflammation (i.e., due to increased cellular permeability) (Galloway 2015). The alveolar region of the lung is a site of potential concern, in part because smaller particles can penetrate this region of the lung (and because they are, by nature, more reactive due to their high surface area), and in part because of the exchanges with systemic circulation that occur at this site. In the upper airway, particles may diffuse through mucus and reach underlying epithelium, where translocation may occur. However, diffusion through mucus is not expected to occur for insoluble particles such as microplastics. It should be noted that, in rats, ultrafine particles have been shown to reach brain tissue via translocation from the nasal cavity through the olfactory nerve (Oberdörster et al. 2004).
There is a paucity of information on the physical hazards related to inhalation of microplastics. Future studies should focus on confirming and exploring the toxicological mechanisms of the physical hazards associated with microplastics, including their effects on the lung and cardiovascular system and their capacity to translocate to extra-pulmonary tissues.
Studies in humans
In the only controlled dosing studies of microplastics in humans, participants were exposed to printer toner, which was not considered relevant for this evaluation. Epidemiology studies of microplastics in indoor or ambient air could not be found for the general population. Health effects studies of microplastics are limited to several occupational epidemiology studies and a lung biopsy study; these studies are summarized below.
Two reviews (Wright and Kelly 2017; Prata 2018) summarized the outcomes of occupational epidemiology studies in individuals who worked with synthetic textiles, nylon flock, and PVC. The studies identified associations between work in these industries and increases in adverse respiratory effects, including airway lesions and fibrosis, decreased pulmonary function, wheezing, dyspnea, inspiratory crackles, chronic cough, chronic mucous production, eye and throat irritation, increased bronchial responsiveness, bronchitis, bronchiolitis, emphysema, asthma, pneumoconiosis, interstitial lung disease, and acute respiratory failure (Wright and Kelly 2017; Prata 2018). Several studies also found associations between work in these industries and cancers of the digestive system and respiratory tract, but not all studies investigating these effects identified the association. Despite the associations between exposures to plastic particulates or fibres and adverse health effects, no firm conclusions on human health effects can be made owing to confounding variables such as co-exposures with other workplace hazards that could contribute to respiratory effects.
A third review discussed the epidemiological evidence of health effects in women working in plastics manufacturing and processing industries, but did not specifically address microplastics (DeMatteo et al. 2012). Epidemiology studies identified associations between work in plastics industries and breast cancer, spontaneous abortion, and infertility. As exposures to microplastics were not specifically discussed in these studies, it is unclear whether associations with these health effects are related to inhalation of plastic particulates and fibres or exposure to other substances used in the production of plastic.
Epidemiology studies have been developed for other occupations with exposure to microplastics. However, most studies limited exposure categorization to occupation, and therefore adverse outcomes from exposure to microplastics were not specifically investigated. A small subset of the epidemiology studies included analyses specifically related to exposure to plastic particulates or fibres; only these studies are discussed here. No increases in lung or respiratory tract cancer were associated with exposure to PU dust in polyurethane foam (PUF) workers (Sorahan and Pope 1993; Mikoczy et al. 2004; Pinkerton et al. 2016). In pattern and model makers, an increase in lymphocytopenia was significantly associated with exposure to plastic dusts, but no exposure–response relationship was observed (Demers et al. 1994).
The relevance of occupational data on airborne microplastics to the general population is unknown, as extrapolation from high-dose occupational exposures to lower doses, as would be expected for the general population, is difficult in the absence of health effect data at lower concentrations. A further limitation of the dataset is that most studies did not investigate the impact of dose–response on the health outcomes. Additionally, workers in the studies might have had co-exposures to other chemicals associated with adverse health effects, such as monomers, catalysts, additives, and other compounds used in the workplace.
Studies in experimental animals
Studies of inhaled microplastics were identified for rats (Laskin et al. 1972; Thyssen et al. 1978; Hesterberg et al. 1992; Warheit et al. 2003; Ma-Hock et al. 2012), hamsters (Laskin et al. 1972), and guinea pigs (Pimentel et al. 1975). The microplastic constituents in the studies included PP fibres (Hesterberg et al. 1992), PU particulate (Laskin et al. 1972; Thyssen et al. 1978), nylon fibres or particulate (Pimentel et al. 1975; Warheit et al. 2003), PAN particulate (Pimentel et al. 1975), and acrylic ester copolymer (Ma-Hock et al. 2012). Exposure duration varied, with one longer-duration study of 325 days, two studies of subchronic duration (12 to 13 weeks), and three studies of subacute duration (5 to 30 exposure days). Detailed descriptions of these studies, including test concentrations and results, are presented in Table D-2 in Appendix D.
Effects observed in inhalation studies tended to be consistent and independent of duration, type of plastic, and species. Observations consistent with foreign body reactions were common in the studies. This included an increase in activity or number of inflammatory cells, which contained fibres or particles (primarily in lung tissues and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid [BALF], but also in the lymphatic system) and which were often accompanied by granulomas. In areas of lungs associated with particle deposition, hyperplasia, emphysema, and edema were observed. Studies that euthanized animals at various timepoints post-exposure tended to indicate a reversibility of effects, which might suggest that the effects are adaptive rather than adverse responses. No dose-related effects were observed in mortality, survival time, behaviour, clinical observations, tumour incidence, or fibrosis. LOECs adjusted to reflect intermittent exposure ranged from 0.48 to 2.3 mg/m3. One exception was for the shortest duration study, in which no treatment-related changes in BALF or histology were observed up to the adjusted no observed effect concentration (NOEC) of 2.7 mg/m3 in rats exposed for 5 days and followed up to 24 days post-exposure (Ma-Hock et al. 2012). However, most studies were not performed according to OECD test guideline methods. Moreover, the human relevance of these animal studies is unclear, as exposures in the studies are much higher than would be expected in humans under typical exposure scenarios.
The inhalation studies are also supported by observations in intratracheal instillation studies in rats. Exposures in the studies were to PVC particulate (Agarwal et al. 1978; Pigott and Ishmael 1979; Xu et al. 2004), nylon fibres or particulates (Porter et al. 1999), PS particulate (Brown et al. 2001; Fournier et al. 2018), or PU particulate (Stemmer et al. 1975). Most of the studies incorporated only one exposure level, and contained a single intratracheal instillation, except for one group in Fournier et al. 2018 (every second day). The rats in the various studies were followed from 1 day to 24 months post-instillation. In general, the foreign body reactions observed in inhalation studies were also observed in the intratracheal studies. One study demonstrated that effects from washed PVC particulates were equal to or greater than those from unwashed PVC particulates, suggesting that adverse effects were from the plastic particulate itself rather than from adsorbed additives (Xu et al. 2004). Additional pulmonary effect observations are outlined in Table D-2 in Appendix D. A developmental study also observed an increase in fetal reabsorption sites and evidence of particle translocation from the lungs (placenta, whole pup, fetal liver and heart, and maternal heart and spleen) (Fournier et al. 2018). Although results from the intratracheal studies corroborate effects observed in the inhalation studies, the route of exposure is of lesser quantitative relevance because it does not accurately represent deposition patterns and dosing that would be observed from inhalation.
A review of the toxicology of p-aramid (an aromatic polyamide commonly known as Kevlar) fibrils was also identified (Donaldson 2009). Studies of rat lungs identified effects at high exposure levels, such as inflammation, increased cell proliferation, fibrosis, and development of cystic keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma (a tumour stated to be of questionable relevance to humans due to an absence of a human homologue).
7.2.3 Effects of biofilms
Microplastics provide a unique and extensive surface for microorganisms to attach to and colonize in water environments, forming biofilms (Zettler et al. 2013; De Tender et al. 2015; McCormick et al. 2016; Oberbeckmann et al. 2018; Kettner 2018; Arias-Andres et al. 2018, 2019). However, very few studies have analyzed microplastics-associated biofilms.
Biofilms consist of accumulations of microorganisms, typically encased in a self-secreted matrix of extracellular polymeric substances, containing both organic and inorganic matter (Liu et al. 2016; Prest et al. 2016; WRF 2017). The structure of the extracellular polymeric substances provides protection from stressors (e.g., predators, disinfectants), and aids in uptake and utilization of nutrients (Flemming and Wingender 2010; Prest et al. 2016). Biofilms are ubiquitous in the environment (Hall-Stoodley et al. 2004; Yadav 2017) and in drinking water distribution systems (Liu et al. 2016; Prest et al. 2016; WRF 2017), where they provide a habitat for the survival and growth of microorganisms, including potential pathogens (US EPA 2002; Batté et al. 2003; Berry et al. 2006; Liu et al. 2016).
The higher surface-to-volume ratio of microplastics facilitates the absorption of organic matter, which serves as nutrients for microorganisms, thereby promoting biofilm formation. The transport of microplastics over long distances and through the water column (Peng et al. 2017) affords opportunities for attachment of microbial “hitchhikers” and biofilm formation (Kirstein et al. 2016; Zalasiewicz et al. 2016; Keswani et al. 2016). These plastic-associated biofilm communities are sometimes referred to as “plastispheres” (Zettler et al. 2013) and tend to differ from microorganisms in surrounding water or on natural aggregates/particles (Zettler et al. 2013; Hoellein et al. 2014; McCormick et al. 2016; Oberbeckmann et al. 2016; Kettner et al. 2017; Arias-Andres et al. 2018, 2019). Gene sequencing studies have demonstrated that microbial communities on microplastics are less diverse than those on non-plastic substrates (Zettler et al. 2013; Harrison et al. 2014; McCormick et al. 2014, 2016; Ogonowski et al. 2018a), suggesting that microplastics may select for specific microbial colonizers. In other words, the physicochemical properties of microplastics influence the composition and structure of the associated biofilm community (Bhardwaj et al. 2012; Zettler et al. 2013; Harrison et al. 2014; McCormick et al. 2014, 2016). It is unclear what impact this has, but some have hypothesized that it may result in reduced competition and predation, leading to the emergence of potential pathogens (Amalfitano et al. 2014; Keswani et al. 2016; Andrady 2017). Other factors, including environmental conditions (e.g., salinity, temperature), can also influence biofilm formation on microplastics (Harrison et al. 2018; Oberbeckmann et al. 2018; WHO 2019). In addition, microorganism features, such as the hydrophobicity of their cell walls and cell surface charge, can impact attachment to microplastics (Rummel et al. 2017).
Biofilm constituents commonly found on microplastics include various non-pathogenic microorganisms, comprising species of Pseudomonas, Arcobacter, Erythrobacter, Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, Aspergillus, Penicillium and Phanerochaete (Bhardwaj et al. 2012; McCormick et al. 2014). Pathogenic bacterial sequences, primarily those of Vibrio, have been detected in microplastic-associated biofilms (Zettler et al. 2013; De Tender et al. 2015; Kirstein et al. 2016). However, aside from one study (Kirstein et al. 2016), species identification was not possible, and it is therefore unknown whether the organisms were of human health concern. In the study by Kirstein et al. (2016), Vibrio spp. of potential human health significance were identified, namely V. parahaemolyticus, V. fluvialis, and V. alginolyticus.
The increased cell density and proximity, improved nutrient availability, and protection afforded by an extracellular polymeric substances matrix make biofilms an ideal environment for interactions between microorganisms, including those on microplastics. Among these interactions is conjugation, the transfer of genetic material through direct cell-to-cell contact (Cook et al. 2011; Stalder and Top 2016). Conjugation is a method of horizontal gene transfer (HGT), the primary mechanism for spread of antibiotic resistance, whereby a mobile genetic element (MGE), such as a plasmid, containing antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) is transferred from a donor to a recipient cell (Von Wintersdorff et al. 2016). A few studies have shown that ARGs are more frequently transferred between microplastic-associated biofilm members than free-living bacteria or biofilms associated with natural aggregates (Arias-Andres et al. 2018; Eckert et al. 2018a,b; Imran et al. 2019; Laganà et al. 2019). Transfer also occurred between a broader (i.e., more distantly related) group of microorganisms on the microplastics than in the natural environment. These findings suggest that microplastic-associated biofilms provide a favourable environment (i.e., “hot spot”) for HGT events and may select for antibiotic resistant microorganisms and ARGs, which may then be transported to different habitats. Transfer of ARGs via microplastics has been observed between wastewaters and the aquatic environment (Eckert et al. 2018a,b). Transfer events on microplastics may be further amplified through exposure to metals, as metal resistance genes are present on the same plasmid as antibiotic resistance genes (Baker-Austin et al. 2006; Wright et al. 2006; Seiler and Berendonk 2012; Zhang et al. 2018; Imran et al. 2019).
Although research in this area is very limited, studies suggest that plastic-associated biofilms in water may harbour potential human pathogens and ARGs. Given that microplastics can travel long distances (see Section 4, WHO 2019), there is a possibility that these organisms and/or ARGs may be dispersed across waters and enter drinking water sources. Despite this, there is no indication of how prevalent these organisms are or of how long they persist and/or remain infectious while in a plastisphere. Moreover, conventional drinking water treatment is expected to significantly reduce microplastics and inactivate associated biofilm organisms (see Section 4.1.3, WHO 2019). Thus, there is currently no evidence to suggest that microplastic-associated biofilms in drinking water pose a risk to human health.
Microorganisms might also adhere to the surface of airborne microplastics, but data are limited. Microorganisms have been measured in airborne particulates (Noble et al. 1963; Brodie et al. 2007), although no data exist specifically for plastic particulates. Adherence and growth of microorganisms on airborne microplastics might be limited because they could be dependent on the contact of microorganisms and microplastics in the environment. If contact does occur, however, the plastic particulates might protect and shield adhered microorganisms (Prata 2018). While no data could be found on the characterization of microbial communities potentially colonizing airborne microplastics, lung infections could theoretically occur if pathogenic species were adhered to microplastics and inhaled (Prata 2018).
8. Transport of chemicals
In addition to the physical hazards presented by plastic particles themselves, it is possible that effects could occur as a result of exposure to residual monomers, chemical additives, and sorbed environmental contaminants (e.g., persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and metals) that may leach from microplastic particles (Munier and Bendell 2018; SAPEA 2019). Although there is potential for environmental or human exposure to these compounds, these chemicals are considered to be under the purvue of various programs at Environment and Climate Change Canada and Health Canada and are not discussed further in this report.
Any effects observed from the transport of chemicals are highly context dependent. For example, the type of plastic and the physicochemical properties of the sorbed chemical are known to have an effect on sorption ability. In general, PE shows a greater ability to sorb contaminants, while PET and PVC have a lower sorption capacity (Alimi et al. 2018). Plastics with high surface-area-to-volume ratios (i.e., small, elongated, or have an irregular shape) tend to have higher sorption capacities (Rochman 2015). For instance, PVC was shown to have significantly greater absorption of copper than PS, which could be due to its higher surface area and polarity (Brennecke et al. 2016; Munier and Bendell 2018). Sorption can also be affected by factors such as age, shape and porosity of the particle, salinity and pH of the environment (increased salinity and particle age tend to increase sorption, and alkaline environments favour sorption of cations), and the concentration of metals and other contaminants in the surrounding waters (Munier and Bendell 2018; Guo and Wang 2019). Di and Wang (2018) sampled surface waters and sediments from China’s Three Gorges Reservoir and found that several contaminants were adsorbed to the surface of the recovered microplastics, including organic solvents and pharmaceutical intermediates.
The properties of the receiving environment can also affect contaminant transfer. Mohamed Nor and Koelmans (2019) found that the transfer of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) from microplastics in simulated gut fluid is biphasic and fully reversible. More specifically, the effect of microplastics in the gut depends on the contents of the gut system. Ingested plastics acted as a source of hydrophobic organic compounds (HOCs) in clean gut systems, whereas in contaminated gut systems, clean microplastics rapidly extracted PCBs from food or other organic matter (Mohamed Nor and Koelmans 2019). The authors concluded that chemical contamination and cleaning can occur simultaneously when microplastics are ingested.
Although many of the compounds associated with plastic have short biological half-lives and are not persistent, plastic particles within the body could present a long-term source of exposure to the chemicals (Engler 2012). While recent reviews indicate that there is a low health concern for human exposure to chemicals from ingestion of microplastics from food or drinking water (EFSA 2016; FAO 2017; WHO 2019), further research would be required before a human health risk assessment on microplastics is possible. No data could be found on the transfer of these compounds in the human respiratory or GI tract.
Sorbed chemicals
Provencher et al. (2018b) found no significant correlations between concentrations of various PCB congeners in northern fulmars (Fulmarus glacialis) and the amount of ingested plastics when using a toxic equivalency factor (TEF) approach. They found that plastics did not contribute to the PCB concentrations in the birds and that the PCB congener profile between ingested plastics and the liver differed (Provencher et al. 2018b). This could be the result of the ability of northern fulmars to metabolize or bio-transform contaminants such as PCBs (Letcher et al. 2010; Provencher et al. 2018b). In a study using goldfish (Carassius auratus), Grigorakis and Drouillard (2018) observed lower dietary assimilation efficiencies (13.4%) for PCBs sorbed to microplastics compared to efficiencies (51.6%) for PCBs associated with food. The authors concluded that the lower bioavailability of PCBs associated with microplastics indicates that microplastic presence is unlikely to increase PCB bioaccumulation in fish. In a study by Devriese et al. (2017), Norway lobsters (Nephrops norvegicus) exposed to PCB-loaded PE or PS microplastics showed no significant bioaccumulation of the chemicals, with uptake of the PCBs being limited. Furthermore, Gerdes et al. (2019) found a positive correlation between the elimination rate of PCBs in Daphnia magna and the presence of microplastics. More specifically, the presence of microplastics together with PCBs was able to increase the elimination rate of high-molecular-weight PCB congeners in D. magna fourfold.
Diepens and Koelmans (2018) introduced a theoretical model simulating transfer of microplastics and HOCs in aquatic Arctic food webs. Simulated scenarios showed that PCBs biomagnify to a lesser extent with higher levels of microplastic ingestion, which supports the evidence previously described. Conversely, the same model also indicated that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) biomagnify more with elevated levels of microplastic ingestion. Under different conditions, Magara et al. (2018) found that the uptake and accumulation of fluoranthene (a PAH) in blue mussels (Mytilus edulis) were not affected by incubation with microplastics and that incubation with microplastics reduced the bioavailability of fluoranthene. In a study modelling the transfer of POPs from PVC and PE to benthic invertebrates, fish, and seabirds, Bakir et al. (2016) found that food and water were the main pathways of exposure for all organisms, and input from microplastic particles was negligible.
Tanaka et al. (2013) studied the occurrence of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) in tissues of short-tailed shearwater (Puffinus tenuirostris) seabirds, in their natural prey, and in plastics in the stomach of the seabirds. In 3 of the 12 short-tailed shearwaters examined, they detected higher-brominated congeners of PBDEs that were not present in their prey, i.e., lanternfish and squid, which were also sampled from the same area as the seabirds. However, they did detect these PBDEs on the plastics found in the stomachs of the 3 birds, which suggests that plastic-derived chemicals were transferred from the ingested plastic to the seabird tissue.
Hydrophobic POPs of potential human health concern (such as PCBs, PAHs, and organochlorine pesticides) can readily sorb to plastics. For that reason, plastic compounds such as PE and PU are used as passive samplers in environmental monitoring (WHO 2019).
Studies on microplastic-associated sorbed pollutants in drinking water could not be identified, but increased POPs in microplastics have been measured in marine environments and shorelines near urban environments (Wang et al. 2017; Pellet Watch 2019).
Limited data exist on the sorption of chemicals to microplastic particulates in outdoor air, indoor air, or indoor dust. Adsorption of organic pollutants in air to plastic particulates could theoretically occur, but would be dependent on the duration of microplastic suspension in air (Prata 2018). One study reported that no significant adsorption of PCBs, dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) or nonylphenol occurred on virgin PP pellets released in the atmosphere for 6 days (Mato et al. 2001). Therefore, the contribution of microplastics to inhalation of sorbed chemicals is unknown but potentially limited, although it is anticipated to be dependent on environment (e.g., urban versus rural environments, proximity to point sources). Overall, current research shows that while microplastics are able to transport POPs, the evidence suggests that the impact of this exposure pathway is minimal (Burns and Boxall 2018).
Monomers
Plastics are manufactured through the polymerization of monomers, which vary in toxicity. Some of the more hazardous compounds include acrylonitrile, acrylamide, 1,3-butadiene, ethylene oxide, and vinyl chloride (Lithner et al. 2011). Depending on the polymerization process, up to 4% of the plastic material can be composed of residual monomers from incomplete polymerization (Araújo et al. 2002; Lithner et al. 2011). Plastics can also be degraded (through biological processes and weathering) into monomers and oligomers, but few data exist on the contribution of these processes to human exposures to monomers (WHO 2019).
Additives
As discussed in Section 2, plastic additives can include polymer stabilizers, flame retardants, lubricants, plasticizers, and colourants. Compounds with potential human health effects that are additives of plastics include phthalates, polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), lead, and cadmium (WHO 2019), among others. Plastic additives are mostly not co-polymerized, resulting in increased likelihood of being leached into the environment (Wright and Kelly 2017; Hahladakis et al. 2018). Molecular weight of additives and age of plastics are factors that can influence the rate of migration of additives from plastics to the surrounding environment (Hansen et al. 2013; Suhrhoff and Scholz-Böttcher 2016; Jahnke et al. 2017). Limited data exist on the contribution of microplastics to concentrations of plastic additive compounds in the environment, but there is evidence of potential migration pathways for the compounds in sources of human relevance, such as food (Helmroth et al. 2002; Muncke 2011), water (WHO 2019) and indoor dust (Rauert et al. 2014).
9. Knowledge gaps and considerations for future research
Several knowledge gaps were identified during the writing of this report and are outlined below with the objective of encouraging further research. Addressing these knowledge gaps will contribute to the understanding of the environmental and human health risks of plastic pollution and will inform science-based policy and regulatory decisions related to plastic pollution.
9.1 Occurrence
While the approach to observing macroplastics is relatively obvious given their size, there is a general lack of consistency and reliability in the methods used to sample and quantify microplastics in the environment and other media (e.g., drinking water and food). Many studies rely only on visual identification to determine if a particle is plastic. This can lead to a high false positive rate (especially at sizes smaller than 1 mm) and does not allow for proper characterization of plastics. For instance, when fibres visually identified as microplastics from the GI tracts of eelpout (Zoarces viviparus) were analyzed with μATR-FTIR by Wesch et al. (2016), none of the fibres were determined to be of synthetic origin. Given these findings, the authors question whether visual identification alone is sufficient to determine if microfibres are microplastics and call for standardized approaches for identifying and monitoring microplastics. Non-specific fluorescence staining methods have been suggested as a potential rapid-screening approach for detecting and quantifying microplastics in various media (Erni-Cassola et al. 2017; Maes et al. 2017; Prata et al. 2019). However, a major drawback of these staining methods is the possible introduction of false positives through the staining of biological organisms, such as marine algae or organic matter.
Spectroscopy techniques, such as FTIR, Raman spectroscopy and pyrolysis GCMS, are currently the preferred methods for plastic characterization and are often used following separation of plastics from sample media and visual identification using a microscope. Although they increase the accuracy of the identification of microplastics, spectroscopic analyses have limitations that can lead to the underestimation of microplastics in samples. With Raman spectroscopy, the generation of fluorescence can overpower the Raman spectrum produced, which can hinder the identification of potential plastics (Rezania et al. 2018). Furthermore, the signal can be heavily influenced by dyes, as well as by microbiological, organic and inorganic substances (Nguyen et al. 2019). With infrared (IR) spectroscopy, black or dark particles are not detected because they have a high absorption rate (Rezania et al. 2018), and particles below 20 µm may not yield enough absorbance interpretable spectra (Li et al. 2018b). Pyrolysis GCMS lacks reproducibility, as results are highly dependent on sample preparation and pyrolysis type. Thermal desorption GCMS is best used for samples of high mass (up to 100 mg) but lacks the sensitivity of pyrolysis GCMS (Nguyen et al. 2019). Microplastic counts can also be overestimated. Using SEM with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), Anderson et al. (2017) found that, on average, 23% of the particles that were visually identified as plastics were not plastic. Burns and Boxall (2018) highlight that the error rate for identifying particles as plastic ranges from 33% to 70%. While analytical methods may help to confirm the synthetic nature of microplastics sampled in the environment, the inconsistencies in sampling methods (e.g., size of subsamples and sampling strategies) can limit the comparability of such analyses.
Studies investigating the occurrence of plastics in the environment and other media often use different units to report plastic abundance (e.g., plastics per area vs. plastics per unit volume), thereby limiting comparisons between studies and generalizability of results. Standardized reporting metrics are required to ensure reporting consistency and study comparability (Burns and Boxall 2018). Another major gap in the analytical process is that there are no inter-laboratory studies, which are useful for method validation. Furthermore, due to variability and difficulty in quantifying microplastics, large standard deviations have been reported for the occurrence of microplastics in the environment and, in some instances, the standard deviation value exceeds the reported measurement.
In water, microplastics are sampled at size ranges that are compatible with available sampling apparatus (e.g., trawl nets, which have a mesh size of 300 to 350 μm). This means that microplastics smaller than 300 µm can often go undetected. This is an issue for microfibres in particular given their narrow size (Covernton et al. 2019). Sampling methods therefore need to be developed to support the characterization of the smaller size fractions of plastics in the environment. Further, sampling depths vary across studies and are not standardized (i.e., trawl nets would be biased to less dense plastics that are present near the surface of surface waters, and studies conducted at a greater depth would be biased against denser plastics).
A limited number of published studies report on environmental monitoring and effects in freshwater environments, and few data are published on the terrestrial environment (Burns and Boxall 2018; Provencher et al. 2018a). There is a need to expand work to include monitoring studies to other ecosystems, particularly terrestrial ecosystems.
In terrestrial matrices, studies of microplastic occurrence are scarce, possibly due to difficulty in translating research ideas in a marine context to a terrestrial context (Rillig 2012; da Costa et al. 2019). For example, there are no parallels for the accumulation of microplastics along shorelines in a terrestrial setting. In addition, it is often more difficult to isolate and characterize microplastics from a soil matrix; soil can contain varying levels of organic matter, which can distort signals and present problems when using FTIR and Raman spectroscopy for plastic characterization (Bläsing and Amelung 2018). Furthermore, there is a lack of standardized protocols for soil sampling and analysis in various soil types (da Costa et al. 2019). It has been suggested that a standard step-by-step approach be employed for terrestrial samples, involving removal of adherent fragments, mineral phase, and organic matter, followed by microplastic identification and quantification (da Costa et al. 2019).
There is also a lack of appropriate quantitative data for microplastic presence in drinking water and in water discharged after wastewater treatment, and limited information is available on the fate of microplastics during the wastewater treatment process, including particle breakdown, particle composition, removal efficiency, and subsequent release of these microplastics to other environmental compartments.
Occurrence data for microplastics in food is also scarce, with little to no Canadian-specific data. Data that do exist are focused on wild marine fish and shellfish, with limited occurrence data for freshwater and farmed species or other foods. In addition, occurrence data are needed for the tissues and organs of animals that are consumed by humans. Data are lacking on the potential effects of cooking or food processing (e.g., fresh versus frozen food) on microplastic concentrations, the impact of the food matrix on microplastic bioavailability (e.g., water-based versus solid/dry foods), and the potential point source(s) of exposure to microplastics in food. Further studies are needed to determine whether food manufacturing, processing and/or handling as well as food packaging materials may contribute to microplastic concentrations in food.
There are currently no validated or recognized methods for the collection or analysis of microplastic samples in air, and little information is available on the partitioning of microplastic particles between air and dust. In order to accurately assess microplastic exposure from air, there is a need to develop and validate accurate, precise and reproducible methods for the sampling, extraction, characterization, and quantification of airborne microplastics and microplastics in settled dust and air, including robust quality assurance and control protocols. As Canadians spend approximately 90% of their time indoors, data on both indoor and outdoor microplastic exposures are needed to determine personal exposures, to understand their sources, pathways, fate, and distribution, and to identify and prioritize specific microplastic categories or mixtures for future research. There is also a need to explore the relationship between airborne microplastic particles and particulate matter. For example, knowing what proportion of particulate matter is composed of plastic polymers and knowing whether airborne plastic particles behave similarly to other airborne particulates would be useful in determining whether inferences can be made from the wealth of knowledge that exists on particulate matter.
Several researchers have identified the need for standardized protocols and stricter quality assurance in literature to ensure the availability of more high quality occurrence and exposure data in all media (Burns and Boxall 2018; Hermsen et al. 2018; Gouin et al. 2019; Koelmans et al. 2019). For sampling methods, this would include collection media, equipment, and handling procedures, as well as laboratory analysis practices. Due to the ubiquity of plastics, additional care must be taken throughout the entire process, from sample collection to laboratory analysis, to prevent sample contamination.
The importance of protocol development can be demonstrated by Provencher et al. (2017, 2019), who developed the only standardized protocols for monitoring and studying ingested plastics in seabirds. They include standardized field and lab techniques, as well as reporting guidelines for data (Provencher et al. 2017, 2019). The use of these standardized techniques by the international seabird community has led to spatial and temporal tracking of trends in plastics in the marine environment.
It has been recommended that a standardized quality criteria be developed that can be used to evaluate the appropriateness of studies on microplastic occurrence and effects. Hermsen et al. (2018) proposed several areas that should be evaluated when scoring the quality of microplastic ingestion studies: sampling method and strategy, sample size, sample processing and storage, laboratory preparation, clean air conditions, negative and positive controls, target component, sample treatment, and polymer identification. When reviewing current studies on microplastic ingestion by biota, they identified negative controls, polymer identification, laboratory preparation, and sample treatment as areas that were particularly lacking in quality and available information. Koelmans et al. (2019) evaluated 50 microplastic studies in freshwater surface water and drinking water using the same method identified by Hermsen et al. 2018. Only 4 studies scored positively on all proposed quality criteria; 92% of the reviewed studies were not considered complete or reliable on at least one criterion. It should be noted that Hermsen et al. (2018) and Koelmans et al. (2019) acknowledge that their criteria are not an absolute judgement of the value of studies since not all aspects of studies could be captured in their scoring system. Moving forward, the use of standardized quality criteria will ensure that only data of acceptable quality are being used to inform scientists and policy makers and that the data are both reproducible and directly comparable.
There is also a paucity of data on the common or important sources of microplastics in the environment and other media, such that identifying source contributions of microplastics is difficult. There is a need to develop libraries that can be used to link samples to their sources using their chemical composition (polymer and additive chemicals) and other physical properties. Furthermore, establishing a taxonomy of microplastics based on morphology may also be informative in determining sources (Helm 2017).
Lastly, data on the occurrence and effects of nanoplastics is still emerging and is poorly understood. It is unclear whether and how nanoplastics may form in the environment (e.g., whether they are formed by processes such as the weathering of macroplastics or microplastics). There is a lack of appropriate analytical methodologies for nanoscale materials in all media, making accurate measurements of environmental occurrence and behaviour of nanoplastics difficult to evaluate (SAPEA 2019). As nanoplastics are inherently more difficult to test and measure, the importance of plastics fragmenting to the nano scale remains unclear at this time (Koelmans et al. 2015).
9.2 Environmental effects
The size ranges and concentrations of microplastics used in ecotoxicological research do not reflect the concentrations or sizes of microplastics collected in the environment using current sampling techniques. Microplastic effects studies are performed using either concentrations that are much higher than those currently reported in the environment or very small microplastics for which limited occurrence data exists (SAPEA 2019). Researchers studying effects should use plastics of similar size, shape, and composition to those found in the environment. Additionally, there is a need to further investigate the relationship between microplastics and natural particles that exist in the environment that induce similar effects in biota. Currently, experimental designs do not differentiate plastic-specific effects from those caused by other particles, such as clay or cellulose (Ogonowski et al. 2018b). Furthermore, effects studies are largely conducted with PS microplastic spheres, which are not representative of plastics found in the environment. More frequently detected microplastics (i.e., PP, polyester, and PA, among others) are underrepresented in effect studies (SAPEA 2019).
There is therefore a need to develop standard methods for testing the potential for adverse effects associated with exposure to plastic. For example, there is a need to evaluate the relationship between properties of plastic (e.g., particle size, shape and particle number) and toxicity. There is a corresponding lack of consistency in reporting test concentrations in studies; some studies report weight/volume, while others report particle number/volume
Pristine microplastics will likely contain additives such as catalysts. Consequently, it is possible that the resulting effects observed when testing these microplastics could be due to the catalyst and not solely to the polymer. For example, Pikuda et al. (2019) found that the acute toxicity to D. magna was associated with sodium azide, a surfactant, and not the plastic PS particles themselves. When the sodium azide was removed from the plastics, the PS particles no longer caused mortality. Thus, plastic particles used to test effects in organisms should be washed to remove any additives that may cause effects that can be confused with effects caused by the particles themselves. Currently, this is not standard practice, and this was not considered when selecting studies for this report.
Burns and Boxall (2018) suggested that research in this field should move to the use of environmental degradation studies. Follow-up ecotoxicological studies should then be conducted using the resulting materials identified in the degradation studies. There is a need to develop certified standard reference materials that are environmentally relevant and meet the needs for risk assessment. This would help to characterize the effects of environmentally relevant plastics. Experiments that consider chronic effects (including effects of long-term retention within organisms) using consistent endpoints should also be completed. Provencher et al. (2018a) highlighted a need for studies that examine plastic transfer between predator and prey, as well as the biomagnification, bioaccumulation, and bioconcentration of these transferred plastics. Further research is needed on the mechanisms of absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of microplastics and on the feasibility of a read-across approach from particle translocation studies. There is also a need to develop a better understanding of the sub-lethal, interactive and cumulative effects of plastics with other factors. For example, although a recent study has shown that there may be sub-lethal effects related to plastic ingestion on the blood chemistry of flesh-footed shearwaters in the southern hemisphere, the authors are unable to make definitive links at this time (Lavers et al. 2019). Further, while studies such as those by Lavers and Bond (2016) on ingested plastics as a route for the transport of trace metals have indicated that concentrations of certain metals were positively related to plastic mass, generalizations about the transfer of trace elements from ingested plastics are not yet possible as the mechanisms underlying this process are unknown. In addition, some studies on microplastic ingestion have only examined a portion of an organism's digestive tract, which may lead to an underestimation of ingestion rates, since other components of the GI tract may also contain microplastic particles. To accurately estimate all ingested microplastic, it is recommended that the entire GI tract, from esophagus to vent, of fish and the entire body for smaller species (i.e., bivalves) be examined (Hermsen et al. 2018).
There is a lack of research on microplastics in soil, and further study is needed to fully understand the interactive effects that plastic pollution will have on soil fauna and potential uptake into food crops. Finally, while some sources and occurrences of microfibres have been identified, further work is needed to fully understand their distribution and fate in the environment, as well as the effects this type of plastic pollutant presents.
Recent research has begun to explore links between plastic pollution and climate change. For example, Royer et al. (2018) showed that commonly used plastics produce greenhouse gases when exposed to ambient solar radiation, and virgin plastics had higher emissions of hydrocarbon gases than environmentally aged plastic pellets. This suggests that plastic pollution may be contributing to climate change. There is also evidence to suggest that climate change could contribute to increased wildlife exposure to plastic pollution. For example, Drever et al. (2018) reported that, under unusually warm ocean temperatures, red phalaropes (Phalaropus fulicarius) were found feeding closer to shore. The authors indicated that distribution shifts of the birds closer to shore resulted in increased exposure to plastic pollution.
In addition to the uncertainties inherent in microplastic toxicity testing described above, there is a need to conduct toxicity tests on nanoplastics; however, these may be also confounded by the suspension matrix used (Pikuda et al. 2019). Toxicity results for studies using commercially formulated nanoparticles, which are likely to contain preservatives, antimicrobials, or surfactants, must therefore be carefully considered (Pikuda et al. 2019).
9.3 Human health effects
In order to better understand the potential human health effects of microplastics resulting from both oral and inhalation exposures, an improved understanding of the extent and nature of human exposure and potential toxicological hazards is required.
With respect to the potential human health impacts of microplastic ingestion (e.g., from drinking water and/or food) and inhalation (e.g., from indoor and ambient air), more research is needed on the uptake and fate of microplastics in the GI and respiratory tracts and on the bioavailability of chemical substances associated with microplastics. In addition, from an inhalation perspective, there is a need to better characterize microplastics exposure for particles of aerodynamic diameter in the micron scale (<1 mm), with a focus on inhalable particles (<10 µm) and especially respirable particles (<2.5 µm) that can penetrate deep into the lungs. There is also a need to understand the physical characteristics of microplastics (e.g., length, diameter, polymer type, surface chemistry) that may determine their bioavailability, tissue distribution, and potential relevance to human health.
Toxicological research using appropriate cell models and experimental animals that would be needed to identify target tissues and threshold dose and to inform hazards for human health risk assessment is generally lacking. More research is also required to improve the understanding of whether the characteristics (e.g., size, shape, composition) of microplastics influence their potential adverse effects. In addition, as information emerges regarding the health-relevant properties of microplastics, standardized reporting metrics are needed to ensure that those features are adequately characterized in scientific reports.
There is also a need to understand the extent to which microplastics may act as a vector for transporting other chemicals (e.g., chemicals additives, adsorbed environmental contaminants) and to determine whether they have an impact on human health. While recent reviews indicate that there is a low health concern for human exposure to chemicals from ingestion of microplastics from food or drinking water (EFSA 2016; FAO 2017; WHO 2019), further research would be required before a human health risk assessment on microplastics is possible. Further research investigating the toxicity of nanoplastics is also required, as described above.
Lastly, there is also a need for improved characterization of microplastic-associated biofilms in drinking water, drinking water sources and air. Gaining increased knowledge in such areas as the factors shaping biofilm composition, the taxonomy of biofilm communities, and biofilm activity and interactions (e.g., transfer of ARGs) would contribute to the understanding of the importance of biofilms on human health.
10. Findings
Plastic pollution, in the form of macroplastics and microplastics, is ubiquitous in the environment. It is estimated that, in 2016, 1% of all plastic waste in Canada, or 29 kt, was discharged to the environment as litter. Since plastics degrade very slowly and are persistent in the environment, the frequency of occurrence of plastic pollution in the environment is expected to increase.
Macroplastics have been demonstrated to cause physical harm to environmental receptors on an individual level and to have the potential to adversely affect habitat integrity. Organisms have been shown to ingest macroplastics and to become entangled in macroplastics, which can result in direct harm and in many cases, mortality.
The evidence for potential effects of microplastic pollution on environmental receptors is less clear and sometimes contradictory, and further research is required. For example, although there are reports indicating that exposure of environmental receptors to microplastics can lead to mortality, developmental and reproductive effects, effects on feeding and energy production, and biochemical or molecular-level effects, a similar number of reports have found no effects.
The current literature on the human health effects of microplastics is limited. Potential exposure pathways include air, water and food. While some occupational epidemiology and experimental animal studies show the potential for effects at high exposure concentrations, they are of questionable reliability and relevance, and further research on the potential for microplastics to impact human health is required.
Given the increasing amounts of plastic pollution in the environment and the demonstrated ability of macroplastics to harm environmental receptors, it is anticipated that the frequency of occurrence of physical effects on individual environmental receptors will continue to increase if current trends continue.
As discussed in this report, there are a multitude of sources (see Section 3) that contribute to plastic pollution. In keeping with the precautionary principle, action is needed to reduce macroplastics and microplastics that end up in the environment.
In order to advance the understanding of the impacts of plastic pollution on the environment and human health, it is recommended that research be conducted to address key knowledge gaps identified in this report. This includes studies to improve the understanding of both exposure to and potential toxicity of plastics. More specifically, research is recommended in the following areas:
- Developing standardized methods for sampling, quantifying, characterizing and evaluating the effects of macroplastics and microplastics;
- Furthering understanding of human exposure to microplastics;
- Furthering understanding of the ecotoxicological effects of microplastics;
- Furthering understanding of the effects of microplastics on human health; and
- Expanding and developing consistent monitoring efforts to include lesser characterized environmental compartments such as soil.

Appendix A: Additional occurrence of plastics in the global environment
A-1. Shoreline
Plastic pollution has been detected on shorelines around the world. For example, one study found macroplastics on every beach surveyed on an island in French Polynesia, where plastics accounted for 20% to 100% of all litter items (Connors 2017).
Chen et al. (2019) collected marine litter around a tourist city in East China and found that plastic pollutants made up the majority of all floating, benthic, and beached litter. Grocery bags were the most commonly found litter item in all three areas. On shorelines, foams from fishing and aquaculture were found at similar concentrations as grocery bags. The average density of floating microplastics was 36 456 items/km2.
In a study by Horn et al. (2019), microplastics were found on all 51 Californian beaches sampled. The average microplastic count was 11.8 items per 100 mL of sediment. Fibres accounted for 95% of the microplastic items. The polymers identified were PP, isotactic PP, atactic PP, polyacrylate, PE, and polyester.
Ryan et al. (2018) collected litter items sized 2 to 25 mm at South African beaches and reported that plastics comprised 99% of all litter items by number, and that industrial pellets (which form the feedstock of the plastics industry) were the most abundant type of plastic. Typically, pellets enter the environment via accidental spills on land or at sea. Corcoran et al. (2015) found that weather conditions are a factor in industrial pellet accumulation, as is the presence of beached organic material in which they may become entrapped.
Zhou et al. (2018) studied the occurrence of microplastics on beaches adjacent to China’s Bohai Sea and Yellow Sea. Microplastics were both visually identified and analyzed using FTIR, which determined that PE and PP made up the majority of samples. Flakes were the most abundant microplastic, followed by foams, fragments, fibres, pellets, films, and sponges. The abundance of microplastics between sampling sites varied significantly, ranging from 1.3 to 14 712.5 particles/kg dry weight (dw), with an overall average of 740 particles/kg. Similarly, Karthik et al. (2018) studied the occurrence of microplastics on beaches along the southeast coast of India. Microplastic particle concentration along the coast ranged from 2 to 178 particles/m2, with a mean of 46.6 particles/m2. FTIR analysis identified PE, PP, and PS as the main components of identified plastics.
Plastics, both macro and micro, are widely found in the Arctic, despite its distance from industrialized and highly populated areas. Plastics have been found in all abiotic environments of the European Arctic, and monitoring of beach litter in the Atlantic Arctic in 2017 revealed that the amount beach litter varied from a mean of 1 475 items per 100 m in the spring to 195 items per 100 m in the summer months (PAME 2019).
A-2. Surface water
Plastic waste is found in fresh and marine surface waters worldwide, and extensive research has been done on the occurrence of microplastics in marine surface waters. A brief summary of selected papers is presented below.
In the United States, Mason et al. (2016) collected surface water samples from Lake Michigan and found an abundance of microplastic particles ranging from about 1 400 to 100 000 particles/km2 (mean of 17 267 particles/km2), with 59% of the particles in the size range of 0.355 to 0.999 mm. Microplastic abundances were fairly evenly distributed across the lake surface despite a seasonal gyre that developed in the southern end of the lake. Fragments dominated, followed by fibres and line, and the most common type of microplastics was PE, followed by PP. A study by Wang et al. (2018) investigated microplastics in freshwater in China. Concentrations in Dongting Lake and Hong Lake ranged from 900 to 4 659 particles/m3, and the concentrations were much higher in the outlet channel between Dongting Lake and the Yangtze River, an area with heavy shipping traffic. The microplastics were mainly PE and PP, and the majority were fibres. Additionally, more than 65% of all microplastics were smaller than 2 mm (Wang et al. 2018).
Surface water samples were collected along the Rhine River in Europe, and microplastics were found in all samples with an average concentration of 892 777 particles/km2. A peak concentration of 3.9 million particles/km2 was measured in a single sample collected at Rees, in Germany, supporting the finding that higher microplastic concentrations are found near densely populated areas. Most of the microplastics recovered were spheres, followed by fragments (Mani et al. 2015).
Macroplastics have been observed floating on the Arctic sea surface, and microplastics have been found in Arctic Ocean surface waters and in the water column. Of the microplastics observed in surface and subsurface waters (to a depth of 6 m), 95% were fibres (Hallanger and Gabrielsen 2018). Plastics may also become entrapped in sea ice, and microplastics levels ranging from 38 to 234 particles/m3 of ice have been measured (Obbard et al. 2014). More recently, Peeken et al. (2018) measured microplastic abundances in Arctic sea ice ranging from 1.1 × 106 particles/m3 to 1.2 × 107 particles/m3, with highly variable concentrations. Most of these microplastics were smaller than 50 μm in size. Of the 17 polymers identified, PE was the most common, with a mean of 48%.
In the Adriatic Sea, Zeri et al. (2018) found significantly higher macroplastic abundance in offshore waters (>4 km) than in inshore waters, but higher abundances of microplastics in nearshore waters (≤4 km) than in offshore waters. The authors collected 22 245 particles of floating microplastics from surface waters, and visually identified 658 floating macroplastics, which accounted for 91.4% of litter items recorded. They found that 29% of the macroplastics was plastic bags, 22% was plastic pieces, 15% was sheets, 13% was fish boxes of expanded PS, 8.8% was cover/packaging, 4.3% was PS pieces, and 1.4% was plastic bottles.
Floating litter collected in Vietnam consisted of a mean of 26% plastics by weight. Of the total plastic mass, 37% was plastic bags, 14% plastic packaging (single-use food containers), and 48% was other plastics, such as plastic bottles, food wrappers, cups, and cutlery (Lahens et al. 2018).
The occurrence and aggregation potential of microplastics in the Mediterranean Sea has been reported by several researchers. For example, de Haan et al. (2019) collected surface water samples using 335 µm mesh nets, which yielded 2 489 plastic particles. Microplastics made up 94.6% of plastic abundance and 55% of plastics by weight, averaging 0.10 items/m2. The three most abundant polymers were LDPE and HDPE (54.5%), PP (16.5%) and PS (9.7%) (de Haan et al. 2019).
Bordós et al. (2019) examined microplastic occurrence in Hungary. Given the use of a 2 mm pre-filter during sampling, microplastics between 2 mm and 5 mm were not sampled. Suspected plastics particles were visually identified and analyzed under a FTIR microscope and six polymer types were identified: PE, PP, PS, polytetrafluoroethylene, polyacrylate, and polyester. Of the 13 water samples taken, 12 contained microplastics ranging from 3.52 to 32.1 particles/m3 with an average of 13.8 particles/m3. All water entering sampling locations (i.e., influents) had higher microplastic concentrations than the water leaving that sampling location (i.e., effluents).
Pan et al. (2019) reported microplastics in surface waters across the Northwestern Pacific Ocean. The concentration of particles collected from 18 stations varied significantly, ranging from 6.4 x 102 to 4.2 x 104 items/km2. Microplastics were analyzed by Micro-Raman spectroscopy, yielding a distribution of 57.8% PE, 36.0% PP, and 3.4% nylon.
Poulain et al. (2019) investigated the concentration of microplastics in the North Atlantic Subtropical Gyre. Microplastics were categorized as small microplastics (SMPs, 0.025 to 1 mm) and large microplastics (LPMs, 1 to 5 mm). SMPs were collected by a 25 μm mesh net, and LMPs by a 300 μm mesh net. The authors accounted for the decreased buoyancy of SMPs compared to LMPs and applied a correction factor for the increased susceptibility of microplastics to wind-driven vertical transport. The concentrations of LMPs and SMPs corrected for vertical transport are 50 to 1000 g/km2 and 5 to 14 000 g/km2, respectively.
Eriksen et al. (2014) conducted 680 net tows of global surface water and found plastics in 92.3% of the tows. Visual surveys in the South Pacific, North Pacific, South Atlantic, Indian Ocean, and water around Australia also indicated that foamed PS items were the most frequently observed macroplastics. The authors estimated that there are 5.25 trillion particles of plastic floating at sea, totalling to 268 940 tonnes. Their results indicate that plastic pollution has spread throughout the world's oceans and that plastics accumulate in subtropical gyres. There is an area with accumulation of buoyant plastics in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre that is commonly referred to as the Great Pacific Garbage Patch (Eriksen et al. 2014). Lebreton et al. (2018) predicted that a 1.6 million km2 zone of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch contains 1.8 trillion pieces of plastics and weighs 79 000 tonnes. The average plastic mass concentration measured inside the Great Pacific Garbage Patch has shown exponential increase over the last decades, from 0.4 kg/km2 (n = 20) in the 1970s to 1.23 kg/km2 (n = 288) in 2015 (Lebreton et al. 2018).
A-3. Benthic zone
Plastic waste has also been detected in marine sediments around the world and is typically dominated by microplastics. Dai et al. (2018) reported the occurrence of microplastics in the surface water, water column and sediment of the Bohai Sea of the Pacific Ocean. Microplastics were detected in all 20 surface water samples, ranging from 0.4 to 5.2 particles/L, with an average of 2.2 particles/L. The average concentration of microplastics in the water column ranged from 1.6 to 6.9 particles/L. There was no clear trend in microplastic accumulation at any specific depth along the water column, and the abundance in sediments was inconsistent with the water column. The surface sediment concentration ranged from 31.1 to 256.3 particles/kg. Fibres dominated the type of microplastics found in both water and sediment, followed by fragments. µ-FTIR analysis identified that the polymer with the highest density in surface waters was PS, whereas PET and PVC were found at highest densities in deeper water.
In Argentina, an average of 25 macroplastic items/m2 and 704 microplastic fragments/m2 were collected from sediment. The macroplastic pollutants were categorized into 24 types, and the most dominant types were food wrappers (PP and PS), bags (HDPE and LDPE), bottles (PET), and disposable Styrofoam food containers (PS) (Blettler et al. 2017). In a study in the United Kingdom, the main types of macroplastic waste found in sediment were packaging, fishing and shipping waste (Browne et al. 2010). Macroplastics and microplastics were found in sediments from a marine protected area in Italy, ranging from a mean of 11.9 to 46.4 pieces and 151.0 to 678.7 pieces per kg dw of sediment, respectively. Greater than 85% of the microplastics were fibres (Fastelli et al. 2016). Bordós et al. (2019) sampled sediment in Hungary and found that 9 of the 12 sediment samples contained microplastics ranging from 0.46 to 1.62 particles/kg, with an average of 0.81 particles/kg. The most dominant polymer was PP. Marine litter in Croatia ranged from 3.4 items/kg dw to 528 items/kg dw, with macroplastics making up 1.3% to 11.3% of samples. Like in Italy, fibres were the most abundant type of microplastic found in Croatia, ranging from 39.9% to 90.1% of the total number of plastic items (Renzi et al. 2019; Blašković et al. 2017). Blašković et al. (2017) found no correlation between the extent and pattern of plastic contamination and sediment grain size or sampling depth. In Svalbard in the Arctic, fibres were once again found to be the dominant microplastic in sediment at depths of 40 to 79 m, where they were sampled at a density of 9.2 fibres/kg (Sundet et al. 2016).
Vidyasakar et al. (2018) conducted the first study on the distribution and characteristics of plastic pollutants in marine sediment on Rameswaram Island, along the southeast coast of India. PP was the most abundant polymer type, followed by PE, PS, nylon, and PVC. Irregularly shaped plastics were most plentiful at 69.2%, followed by fibres at 17.9% and pellet-shaped plastics at 12.9%.
Microplastics have been found in large quantities in river sediment in Shanghai (Peng et al. 2018), at concentrations ranging from 5.3 particles/100 g dw to 160 particles/100 g dw. The average concentration across all sites was 80.2 particles/100 g dw. Residential areas showed the highest level of microplastic concentration, followed by parks, rural areas, and tourist areas. Spheres constituted the majority of microplastics at 88.98%, followed by fibres (7.55%) and fragments (3.47%). The two most dominant polymer types identified by μ-FTIR were PP and polyesters (Peng et al. 2018).
García-Rivera et al. (2018) derived data from the MEDITS (International Bottom Trawl Survey in the Mediterranean) program surveys and found that, over 11 years, 2197.8 kg of marine litter was collected from the Spanish Mediterranean seafloor (collected 5 stratum levels at depths from 0 to 800 m) and was comprised of 29.3% plastics by weight. They reported that the amount of marine litter generally remained stable over the survey period. Deep sea litter in the Arctic reportedly increased from 346 items/km2 in 2004 to 8082 items/km2 in 2014, with plastics accounting for 47% of litter (PAME 2019). Recently, an American explorer found a plastic bag and candy wrappers on the seafloor of the Pacific Ocean's Mariana Trench at a depth of nearly 11 km, the deepest submarine dive to date (Morelle 2019).

|Organism and Duration of Exposure||Microplastic Type and Concentration||Summary of Effects||Source|
|Daphnia magna (Water flea) For uptake experiments, exposure was 15, 30, 60, 120 and 240 minutes For depuration experiments, exposure was 1 hour For differential food regime experiments, exposure was 1 hour For chronic toxicity tests, exposure was 21 days||Yellow-green fluorescent, carboxylate-modified PS (2 µm) were used for uptake and depuration experiments Non-fluorescent PS microplastics (2 µm) were used for toxicity tests For uptake and depuration experiments, microplastic concentration was 1.46 × 102 mg/L and algae concentration was 1.00 × 10-1 mg/L For differential food regime experiments, microplastic concentrations were 6.93 × 10−4, 1.39 × 10−3, 2.77 × 10−3, 5.54 × 10−3, 8.31 × 10−3, and 1.11 × 10−2 mg/L; algae concentrations were 5.00 × 10-2, 1.00 × 10-1, 2.00 × 10-1, 4.00 × 10-1, 6.00 × 10-1, 8.00 × 10-1 mg/L Control groups for uptake, depuration, and differential food regime experiments were not exposed to algae For chronic toxicity tests, microplastic concentrations were 1.39 × 10−3 mg/L (low) and 1.11 × 10−2 mg/L (high); algae concentrations were 1.00 × 10-1 mg/L (low) and 8.00 × 10-1 mg/L Control group for chronic toxicity tests was not exposed to microplastic||Uptake and depuration tests of microplastics indicate that D. magna fed both microplastics and algae consumed a significantly lower amount of microplastics than D. magna that only ate microplastics. Using differential food regime experiments, it was also found that this effect could also be seen when using low concentrations of algae and that increasing algal concentrations led to decreasing microplastic uptakes. In adult D. magna, mortality was seen in all treatment groups compared to the control following 7 days of exposure. When using a low algal concentration (1.00 × 10-1 mg/L) with a relatively higher microplastic concentration (1.11 × 10-2 mg/L), the LT50 was 10.09 ± 0.70%, which is slightly lower than the control at the same algal concentration. No impact on reproduction was seen. In neonate D. magna, mortality in those fed a low algal concentration (1.00 × 101 mg/L) and microplastics was significantly higher than neonates fed only algae. No effect on mortality was found for a high algal concentration (8.00 × 10-1 mg/L) and microplastic uptake. There were no significant differences in reproduction between identical food regimes with and without microplastics.||Aljaibachi and Callaghan 2018|
|Xenopus laevis (African clawed frog) tadpoles Developmental stages 36 to 46||Blue PS microplastics (2.75 ± 0.09 μm) at 0.125 μg/mL, 1.25 μg/mL, and 12.5 μg/mL (nominal) Control group was not exposed to microplastic||Microplastics were found in the tadpoles’ digestive tract from each tested concentration; however, SEM analyses suggest no mechanical damage in the epithelium walls as a result. Microplastics were not found in the gills. No significant effects on mortality, body growth, or swimming activity (swimming speed or distance moved) during early life stages were seen.||De Felice et al. 2018|
|Carassius auratus (Goldfish) 6 weeks||Ethylene vinyl acetate fibres (0.7–5.0 mm), PS fragments (2.5–3.0 mm), and polyethylene acrylate pellets (4.9–5.0 mm) Fish were fed concentrations of 1.36%, 1.94%, and 3.81% (g (food+microplastics)/g wwb fish) for the fibres, fragments, and pellets, respectively Control group was given food pellets that contained no microplastic||Various sublethal effects, but no mortality, were observed. Fish exposed to plastic fibres, fragments, and pellets showed significant weight loss compared to the control group. Fragments and pellets were chewed and expelled by fish. The highest occurrence of changes in the upper (27.0%) and lower (30.4%) jaws were seen in the fragment group, followed by the fish exposed to pellets. Damage to the buccal cavity was seen in 80.0% of fish that chewed plastic fragments. This damage ranged from slight exfoliation to deep incisions. In addition, 13.1% of fish exposed to fragments showed sinusoid dilation in their livers. Fibres were found in the gills, gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and feces, but were not likely to accumulate in the GI tract. The frequency of pronounced changes in the upper jaw was the highest in fish exposed to fibres. Additionally, this group showed pronounced and severe damage in their livers. The highest organ index values for the upper jaw, liver, and intestines of fish were also seen in those exposed to fibres. The distal intestine displayed more pronounced and severe changes in comparison to the proximal intestine, which could also be a result of fibre ingestion.||Jabeen et al. 2018|
|Daphnia magna Daphnia pulex Ceriodaphnia dubia (Water fleas) 96 hours||Green fluorescent plastic microspheres (1–5 μm) were used as primary microplastic models Irregularly-shaped PE microplastics (approx. 1–10 μm) were used as secondary microplastic models Concentrations were 103, 104, 105, 106, 107 particles/mL Control group was not exposed to microplastic||Using no-effect concentration estimates and three different temperatures (18°C, 22°C, 26°C), the sensitivity of D. magna and D. pulex to primary and secondary microplastics was found to drastically increase with temperature. This effect was not seen in C. dubia. At the lowest tested temperature (18°C), C. dubia was the most sensitive species. At the highest temperature (26°C), D. magna and D. pulex were more sensitive. Primary microplastics were found to be more toxic than secondary microplastics in C. dubia. For all species, survival was time-dependent as seen in LC50 estimates compared at 48 hours and 96 hours. In D. magna, for example, the 48-hour LC50 was 32.0 particles/mL, whereas the 96-hour LC50 was 18.0 particles/mL at 18°C.||Jaikumar et al. 2018|
|Danio rerio (Zebrafish) 10 days||Virgin PA, PE, PP, and PVC particles (mean diameter of about 70 μm) Two kinds of PS (nominal sizes of 1.0 μm and 5.0 μm) particles were used: virgin PS for the toxicity test and red-fluorescently-labelled PS to examine microplastic distribution in C. elegans For D. rerio, concentrations of 0.001 mg/L, 0.01 mg/L, 0.1 mg/L, 1.0 mg/L and 10.0 mg/L were used For D. rerio, dechlorinated tap water was used for the control group||In D. rerio, there were no significant differences in lethality following 0.001–10.0 mg/L microplastic exposure. In the surviving fish, PA, PE, PP, and PVC particles caused intestinal damage (including cracking of villi and splitting of enterocytes) in 73.3% to 86.7% individuals.||Lei et al. 2018b|
|Chlorella pyrenoidosa (Green algae) 30 days (comprised of three growth periods: lag phase, logarithmic phase, and stationary phase)||PS microbeads (1.0 µm) at 10 mg/L, 50 mg/L, and 100 mg/L in algal cultures Control group was pre-cultured C. pyrenoidosa in the logarithmic growth phase added into BG-11 medium without microplastic||1.0 µm PS caused a dose-dependent decrease in C. pyrenoidosa growth from the lag to early logarithmic phases (day 0 to 22). At 10, 50 and 100 mg/L PS, there was a growth inhibition ratio of 20.9%, 28.4% and 38.1%, respectively. From the lag to early logarithmic phases, microplastics (100 mg/L) had a negative effect on photosynthesis. However, the end of the stationary phase onwards showed a stimulation of photosynthesis that was also dose-dependent. In the presence of microplastics, distorted thylakoids and cell wall thickening were also observed. Following 25 days of exposure, cell morphology mostly recovered.||Mao et al. 2018|
|Daphnia magna (Water flea) 21 day exposure 4 sequential generations||Red fluorescent microspheres (1–5 µm) at 0.1 mg/L Control group was exposed to a clean test medium||Chronic exposure of D. magna to microplastics caused parental mortality (10% to 100%) and a significant decrease in growth, reproduction (total offspring and mobile juveniles), and population growth rate. In two treatment groups, microplastic-exposed populations were extinct in the F1 (2nd) generation. Juveniles produced by microplastic-exposed females were immobile. Some recovery was visible in the F1 population, such as an increase in production of mobile juveniles and earlier first brood release. However, females descending from the exposed population in F0 (called the recovery model population) still experienced a significant reduction in growth, reproduction, and population growth rate up to the F3 generation, in comparison to controls. These findings demonstrate that full recovery from developmental and reproductive effects may take several generations.||Martins and Guilhermino 2018|
|Daphnia magna (Water flea) 14 and 21 days||Fluorescent red microspheres (1–5 µm) at 0.02 mg/L and 0.2 mg/L (nominal) Control group was exposed to hard water without microplastic||When exposing D. magna for 14 days to microplastics, there was a significant reduction in the number of total offspring and a higher frequency of immobile juveniles. No effects on parental female mortality were seen. When exposing D. magna for 21 days to microplastics, there was a dose-dependent effect on mortality. At 0.02 mg/L, microplastics induced 10% of mortality. However, at 0.2 mg/L, microplastics induced 30% of mortality. There were no significant effects on growth. In the 21-day exposure treatment, microplastics also reduced the reproductive fitness of D. magna. Exposure increased the time of first brood release (49%) and reduced the total number of broods released by 71%. Similar to the 14-day treatment, there was also a decrease in the number of offspring and induction of immobile juveniles. There was no effect on the number of aborted eggs in both exposure regimes.||Pacheco et al. 2018|
|Danio rerio (Zebrafish) For distribution experiments, exposure times were 20 hours (4–24 hpfc) and 92 hours (4–96 hpf) For uptake and qPCRd experiments, exposure was 92 hours (4–96 hpf) For developmental effects experiments, exposure was 68 hours (4–72 hpf) For free swimming and light-to-dark experiments, exposure was 116 hours (4–120 hpf)||Green fluorescent PS microplastics (1 μm) For distribution, developmental effects, free swimming, light-to-dark, and qPCR analysis, concentrations used were 100 μg/L and 1 000 μg/L For uptake experiments, concentrations used were 10, 100 and 1 000 μg/L Control group was exposed to embryo medium without microplastic||Microplastics were found to adhere to the embryo chorion and its distribution increased with increasing PS concentration. Microplastic uptake also increased with increasing exposure concentrations. Hatching rate was slightly reduced with exposure; however, this result was not significant. Development speed (in terms of body length and yolk sac area) of larvae was also not impacted significantly from 4–72 hpf. Larvae did not display any obvious malformations. In the free swimming test, exposure to 1 000 μg/L microplastics led to a significant decrease in both swimming distance and larvae speed in dark conditions by 3.2% and 3.5%, respectively. Using an alternating light-to-dark photoperiod stimulation, a significant reduction in swimming competence was also seen in dark conditions. At 1 000 μg/L exposure, total swimming distance was reduced by 2.6% and swimming speed was 2.8% lower in comparison to the control. No significant differences were found when exposed to light conditions. In the 1 000 μg/L exposure group, il1b and cat expression were upregulated to 165% and 121%, respectively. No significant changes were seen in sod expression.||Qiang and Cheng 2019|
|Danio rerio (Zebrafish) 21 days||PS microbeads (5 μm) at 50 μg/L and 500 μg/L Control group was exposed to culture water without microplastic||Significant intestinal damage was observed in 78% and 86% of the histological sections sampled for the 50 μg/L and 500 μg/L treatment groups, respectively. Microplastic exposure was found to induce intestinal oxidative stress and increased permeability. In addition, there was significant alterations in the intestinal metabolic profiles and gut microbiome.||Qiao et al. 2019|
|Daphnia magna (Water flea) 10 days||Uncoated PS particles (1.25 µm) at 2 mg/L, 4 mg/L, and 8 mg/L Control group was not exposed to microplastic||No mortality occurred in all treatments. Reduction in body growth rate, an indicator of population fitness, was also seen with microplastic exposure. Following PS exposure, transcript level of TRxR in D. magna (vital in mediating oxidative defence) significantly increased (2.5–5-fold) with PS concentrations of 2 and 4 mg/L. Transcript level declined at 8 mg/L, but was still significantly higher in comparison to the control group. Arginine kinase (vital in cellular energy production and ATP buffering) transcript level was significantly elevated in the presence of PS (approx. 5-fold at 2 mg/L). Transcript level of permease (facilitates removal of cytotoxic compounds from cells) increased 1.4–1.8 fold when exposed to 2 and 4 mg/L PS. Exposure to 8 mg/L lowered transcription compared to the control.||Tang et al. 2019|
|Gammarus pulex (Amphipod) In the uptake study, exposure was 24 hours In the chronic exposure study, exposure was 48 days||Irregular particles (10–150 μm) were prepared from green fluorescent soft drink bottles made from PET In the uptake study, concentrations used were 0.8 particles/mL, 40 particles/mL, and 4000 plastics/mL In the chronic exposure study, concentration used were 0.8 particles/mL, 7 particles/mL, 40 particles/mL, 400 particles/mL and 4000 particles/mL Negative control group was exposed only to ISO medium; solvent control group was exposed to ISO medium with 10% cetyl alcohol||In the uptake experiment, no mortality was found. In addition, body burden was found to be dependent on dose and age. Body burden was significantly higher in juveniles in comparison to adults for the 0.8 particles/mL and 4000 particles/mL treatments. No significant difference was seen at 40 particles/mL. Furthermore, a higher dosage of microplastics was associated with a significantly higher body burden in both juveniles and adults. In the chronic exposure study, no significant effects were seen on feeding activity, energy reserves and molt periods. Mortality rates also did not vary in juveniles; however, mortality was significantly increased in adults for the 7 particles/mL and 400 particles/mL treatments compared to the control.||Weber et al. 2018|
|Eriocheir sinensis (Chinese mitten crab) For uptake experiments, exposure was 7 days For toxicity tests, exposure was 21 days||Two kinds of PS microspheres (5 µm) were used: fluorescent microspheres for uptake and accumulation experiments, and virgin microspheres for toxicity tests For uptake experiments, a concentration of 40 000 μg/L was used For toxicity tests, nominal concentrations were 40 μg/L (5.4 × 102 particles/mL), 400 μg/L (5.4 × 103 particles/mL), 4 000 μg/L (5.4 × 104 particles/mL) and 40 000 μg/L (5.4 × 105 particles/mL) Control group was not exposed to microplastic||No significant differences in survival were seen with microplastic exposure. Weight gain, specific growth rate, and hepatosomatic index generally decreased with increasing microplastic concentration, with the exception of specific growth rate in the 40 μg/L group. In the uptake experiments, microplastics (40 000 μg/L) accumulated in the gills, liver and guts of E. sinensis. Acetylcholinesterase, alanine aminotransferase, and catalase activities in all treatment groups were significantly lower than seen in the control. The activities of superoxide dismutase, aspartate transaminase, GSHe, and GPxf increased in crabs exposed to 40 and/or 400 μg/L microplastics. However, there was a general decrease in activity with high exposure (4 000 and 40 000 μg/L). Genes encoding the antioxidants SODg, catalase, GPx, and GSTh in the liver initially increased and then decreased in expression following exposure. Further, there was an increased expression of the gene encoding p38 in the MAPKi signaling pathway with treatment of 4 000 μg/L and 40 000 μg/L microplastics, but significant reductions in the expression of ERKj, AKTk, and MEKl. No significant differences in transcription were found with the gene encoding c-Jun N-terminal kinase. These results show that microplastic exposure can induce oxidative stress the liver of E. sinensis.||Yu et al. 2018|

|Oncorhynchus mykiss (Rainbow trout)||Colourless PS particles (100–400 μm) at approx. 500–700 particles/day/fish Control group was not exposed to microplastic||Using histological analysis, no significant effects were seen on the abundance of mucus-secreting goblet cells in the proximal and distal segments of the trout intestine. In addition, there were no adverse changes in tissue morphology, paracellular permeability, and intestinal transporting functions (3H-lysine transport, ion transport capacity, and net ion flow) in the intestines following exposure. PS microplastics did not induce pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory responses in the distal and proximal segments of the intestines.||Ašmonaitė et al. 2018|
|Brachionus plicatilis (Rotifer) 48 hours Tigriopus fulvus (Crustacean) 48 hours Acartia clausi (Marine copepod) 48 hours Mytilus galloprovincialis (Mussel) 48 hours Paracentrotus lividus (Sea urchin) 48 hours Oryzias melastigma (Fish) 1–13 days post fertilization||Non fluorescent LDPE microplastics (1–500 µm) Fluorescent green and red PE microplastics were used to examine particle ingestion in rotifers, copepod, and mussel larvae (nominal size of 1–5 µm) Virgin microplastic loads tested varied with each organism and consisted of 0, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 3, 10, 20, 30, 50, 100 mg/L Control group was exposed to 0.22 μm-filtered seawater without microplastic||Virgin microplastics had no significant effect on mussel embryonic development at any concentration under static conditions or in a rotary wheel. However, orbital shaking at 200 rpm significantly reduced the percentage of D-veliger larvae following exposure. Virgin microplastics did not cause any significant effect at any concentrations below 30 mg/L in any of the species tested. Exceptions of this were for the 1–4 µm particles, which produced a LOEC of 0.01 mg/L for B. plicatilis immobility, LOEC of 1 mg/L for B. plicatilis mortality (LC50 >10 mg/L), and a LOEC of 1 mg/L for T. fulvus mortality (LC50 = about 1.82 mg/L).||Beiras et al. 2018|
|Lophelia pertusa (Cold-water coral) For capture rate and polyp activity experiments, exposure was 7, 20, or 47 days For coral growth rate experiments, exposure was 69 days||LDPE microbeads (500 μm) at 350 beads/L Control group was not exposed to microplastic; control measurements were done in flumes containing no corals to quantify zooplankton sedimentation for the prey capture rate experiment||The capture rates of corals were significantly lower than in the controls at 7 and 20 days after microplastic exposure. After 47 days however, they were not significantly different from the controls, indicating a possible behavioural compensatory response over time. Although microplastics did not impact polyp behaviour, coral exposed to microplastics also had a significantly lower skeletal growth rate in comparison to the control and in situ experimental conditions. Calcification was also reduced.||Chapron et al. 2018|
|Isochrysis galbana, clone T-ISO (Microalgae) 72 hours||PE micronized powder (1.4–42 μm; average particle size of 3.29 μm) at 0.5 mg/L, 1 mg/L, 10 mg/L and 25 mg/L Control group was microalgae with surfactant at its highest concentration||Daily growth rate was not affected by microplastic exposure for all test concentrations. A lower percentage of cellular inhibition was seen when chlorpyrifos were sorbed to microplastics, indicating that it could modulate its toxicity in I. galbana.||Garrido et al. 2019|
|Montastraea cavernosa (Large polyp coral) Orbicella faveolata (Small polyp coral) 2 days||Experiment 1 (Effects of microbeads on calcification): Fluorescent, PE microbeads (size ranges of 90–106 μm, 425–500 μm, and 850–1 000 μm). Experiment 2 (Determination of ingestion size ranges and retention): Uncured, PE microbeads (size ranges of 212–250 μm, 425–500 μm, 850–1000 μm, 1.7–2.0 mm, and 2.4–2.8 mm). Polyps were fed 3 microbeads from each size class. Experiment 3 (Comparing microbeads and microfibres): Uncured, fluorescent, PE microbeads (425–500 μm) and uncured, fluorescent polyester microfibres (3–5 mm long). Polyps were fed 3 plastics of each type. Control groups were not exposed to microbeads; for experiment 2, control group was given food that contained no microbeads||In experiment 1, no significant differences on calcification were seen between the control and the exposed group treated with microplastics. In experiment 2, it was determined that M. cavernosa and O. faveolata ingested 425–500 μm, 850–1 000 μm, 1.7–2.0 mm, and 2.4–2.8 mm microbeads offered. However, a 212–250 μm size class did not elicit a feeding response in either species. No significant differences in egestion were evident in any size classes. In experiment 3, M. cavernosa egested 100% of the microbeads and microfibres. O. faveolata egested means of 80.0% ± 23.3 and 76.7% ± 35.3 for microbeads and microfibres, respectively. There was no significant difference in ingestion between microbeads and microfibres.||Hankins et al. 2018|
|Acanthurus triostegus (Convict surgeonfish) 3, 5 and 8 days||PS microbeads (90 μm) at 5 particles/mL (nominal) Control group was exposed to seawater without microplastic||Exposure to microbeads for 3, 5 and 8 days did not alter the foraging activity (measured as number of bites) in A. triostegus. The survival of post-larvae to predation was also not significantly affected, compared to the control.||Jacob et al. 2019|
|Brachionus koreanus (Monogonont rotifer) For toxicity tests, exposure was 12 days For ingestion, egestion, ROSa levels, MAPK activation, and antioxidant enzyme experiments, exposure was 24 hours||Non-functionalized PS microbeads (0.5 μm and 6 μm) For toxicity tests, concentrations used were 0.1 μg/mL, 1 μg/mL, 10 μg/mL, and 20 μg/mL For ingestion, egestion, ROS levels, MAPK activation, and antioxidant enzyme experiments, the concentration used was 10 μg/mL Control group was not exposed to microplastic||Toxicity of beads was size- and concentration-dependent. In the 6 μm treatment group, B. koreanus had slightly irregular growth, and no significant changes in fecundity and life span. Microbeads were ingested by the rotifers at both sizes. The authors hypothesize that 0.5 μm microplastics have longer retention times that correlate to more negative effects. Increased enzymatic activities of GPx, GRb, GST, and SOD were seen for the 0.5 µm beads. Exposure to 6 μm microplastics had levels similar to that of control conditions. The level of total GSH content was not significantly different for any exposure concentration.||Jeong et al. 2016|
|Paracyclopina nana (Marine copepod) 24 hours||Non-functionalized PS microbeads (0.5 μm and 6 μm) For toxicity tests and ROS levels experiments, concentrations used were 0.1 μg/mL, 1 μg/mL, 10 μg/mL, and 20 μg/mL For ingestion, egestion, western blot, and antioxidant enzyme experiments, the concentration used was 10 μg/mL Control group was not exposed to microplastic||Microbeads of both sizes were ingested but egestion was size-dependent; fluorescence was present for the 0.5 µm microbeads 24 hours after exposure, but not in the 6 μm group. P. nana exposed to 0.5 μm microbeads showed delayed molting. No observable effects were seen with 6 μm microbeads. ROS levels were increased in the 0.5 μm group compared to the control, however not significantly. In addition, the antioxidant enzymes GPx, GR, GST, and SOD had higher activity in the 0.5 μm group.||Jeong et al. 2017|
|Sparus aurata (Gilt-head seabream) 45 days||6 microplastics were used: PVC (high molecular weight; 75.6 ± 15.3 μm), PA (111.7 ± 32.2 μm), PE (ultra-high molecular weight; 23.4 ± 7.6 μm), PS (51.0 ± 36.3 μm), PE (average molecular weight medium density; 54.5 ± 21.3 μm), PVC (low molecular weight; 87.6 ± 16.8 μm) Concentration used was 0.1 g/kg body weight/day Control group was given food that contained no microplastic||Total biomass of the fish per tank was not affected by microplastic exposure. Levels of glucose, aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, lactate dehydrogenase, and gamma-glutamyl transferase did not differ significantly from control conditions following exposure, indicating a lack of stress. The retention of virgin microplastics in the S. aurata GI tract was low. However, 5.3% of all livers examined contained at least one plastic particle following 24 hours. In addition, there was no significant difference in overall histopathology between the different treatment groups.||Jovanović et al. 2018|
|Crepidula onyx (Slipper limpet) 95 days post hatching||PS microplastics (2–5 µm) In the first trial, microplastic concentrations were 30% (low plastic ratio) and 70% (high plastic ratio) of algal concentration used. Final microplastic concentrations were 6 x 104 particles/mL and 1.4 x 105 particles/mL for the low and high plastic ratio treatments, respectively. In the second trial, an additional treatment of 10 particles/mL was added Control group was fed algae||Exposure to 10 particles/L microplastics had no significant effect on growth rate and settling rate in larval C. onyx. No significant difference was seen for juveniles at this concentration. Larval survival was not affected by microplastic addition at a high plastic ratio. In trial 1, adding microplastics appeared to negatively affect growth rates in larvae. Growth rate was reduced when using low plastic ratio and high plastic ratio treatments in comparison to the control. However, there was a trend that settling rate increased in larvae exposed to microplastic. Settling occurred earlier at a smaller size in this group as a result of their reduced growth rate. Microplastic exposure did not have an effect on survival rates or penis development in juveniles; however, there was a negative effect on growth rate. The microplastic group had a 25% slower growth rate in comparison to the control group. C. onyx exposed to only microplastics during their larval stage continued to display slower growth rates than the control, even if microplastics were not present in their environment for 65 days. This finding indicates a legacy effect of microplastic exposure.||Lo and Chan 2018|
|Mytilus edulis (Blue mussel) For ingestion and egestion tests, exposure time was 4 hours For the larval growth tests, exposure time was 15 days||Fluorescent PS beads (2 μm) For ingestion and egestion tests, PS concentrations used were 0.70 mg/L, 1.05 mg/L, and 1.40 mg/L (based on a plastic-to-algae ratio) For the larval growth tests, concentrations used were 0.42 μg/L, 28.2 μg/L and 282 μg/L Control group was not exposed to microplastic; for ingestion and egestion tests, control group was only exposed to algae||The body burden (mass of microplastics per individual) was found to be 4.9 ng/larvae, 3.4 ng/larvae, and 3.1 ng/larvae for the 2 μm beads for bead concentrations of 1.40 mg/L, 1.05 mg/L, and 0.70 mg/L, respectively. No significant effect on larval growth rate was seen, but exposure to beads led to an increase in abnormally developed larva. Malformations were more frequent with increasing concentrations and exposure times. From day 11 on, 40% to 60% of all larvae showed signs of abnormal development.||Rist et al. 2019|
|Thalassiorira pseudonana (Marine diatom algae) Dunaliella tertiolecta (Marine flagellate algae) Chorella vulgaris (Green microalgae) 72 hours||Uncharged PS microbeads (0.5 μm and 6.0 μm) were used on D. tertiolecta Negatively charged carboxylated PS microbeads (0.5 μm) were used on all three test species Concentrations used were 25 mg/L and 250 mg/L (nominal) Control group was not exposed to microplastic||Using pulse amplitude modulation fluorometry, uncharged and negatively charged beads displayed no significant effect on photosynthetic efficiency in all three test species. A small decrease (11%) in D. tertiolecta growth was observed with exposure to uncharged 0.5 µm beads along with a 13% inhibition of growth rate. Effects were less than 10% for the 6 µm beads.||Sjollema et al. 2016|
|Sebastes schlegelii (Jacopever) 14 days||Green fluorescent PS microbeads (15 µm) at 1 × 106 microplastics/L Control group was not exposed to microplastic||Microplastics were found in the gills and intestines following 14-day exposure and 7-day depuration. No translocation to the liver was seen, however. 14-day exposure to microplastics caused feeding time to significantly increase (by approximately 2-fold). Foraging time was rapidly reduced and shoaling behaviour (staying in close proximity from one another) was shown through a reduction in mean distance between fish. In addition, mean swimming speed was reduced and fish used a significantly smaller volume of their tank when foraging in comparison to control fish. Histopathological changes in the liver (hyperaemia), gallbladder (bile turned black in colour), and intestines (altered morphology) of fish were seen following 14 day exposure to microplastics. After 14-day exposure and 7-day depuration, no mortalities were observed; however, there was a significant reduction in growth and energy reserves. Weight gain rate decreased from 8.92 ± 0.98% in controls to 3.09 ± 0.32% in the microplastic-exposed group.||Yin et al. 2018|

|Folsomia Candida (Soil springtail) 28 days||PE beads (<500 µm; size distribution of 32% with <50 µm, 25% between 50 and 200 µm, and 43% between 200 and 500 µm) Concentrations used were 0.005%, 0.02%, 0.1%, 0.5%, 1% microplastics w/w in dry soil Control group was exposed to soil without microplastic||Average survival rates were higher than 80% in all three conditions. Springtails displayed significant avoidance behaviours at 0.5% and 1% (microplastics w/w in dry soil) that appeared to be concentration-dependent. The avoidance rates were 59% and 69%, respectively. Reproduction rate decreased with increasing microplastic concentrations. At the highest tested concentration of 1% microplastics, the reproduction rate was reduced by 70.2%. The EC50 was 0.29% microplastics w/w in dry soil. At concentrations of 0.5% dw soil, MPs significantly altered the microbial community (and decreased bacterial diversity in the springtail gut). Alphaproteobacteria and Wolbachia were significantly less prevalent when exposed to microplastics. However, Bradyrhizobiaceae and Ensifer were significantly increased in the exposed group.||Ju et al. 2019|
|Lobella sokamensis (Soil springtail) 3 minutes||Plastic microbeads (average diameters of 0.50 ± 0.01 μm, 29 ± 4 μm, and 248 ± 14 μm) Plastic fragments (average diameters of 44 ± 39 μm, 282 ± 131 μm, and 676 ± 479 μm) Concentrations in soil were 4 and 8 mg/kg for the roughly 0.50 μm microbeads and for the remaining microplastic sizes, the concentration used was 1 000 mg/kg Concentrations in solution were 10 mg/L and 20 mg/L for the roughly 0.50 μm microbeads Control group was exposed to soil without microplastic and deionized water||The influx of microplastic particles in soil disrupted the movement of L. sokamensis. The springtails moved to avoid becoming trapped, and this behaviour created bio-pores in the soil system. The influx of plastic particles into these cavities subsequently immobilized the springtails within. Using a movement index to quantify springtail behaviour, it was found that movement was significantly different in all size groups in comparison to the control. Specifically in the roughly 0.50 μm microbead solution at 8 mg/kg, movement decreased significantly compared to the other treatment groups.||Kim and An 2019|
|Caenorhabditis elegans (Nematodes) 3 days||PS microplastics (0.5 µm, 1.0 μm, 2.0 μm, and 5.0 μm) at 1.0 mg/L Control group was exposed to suspension solution without microplastic||PS microplastics displayed size-dependent effects on lethality. Survival rates were reduced in all treatment groups. The 1.0 μm group had the lowest mean reduction in survival of 32.27%. In addition, the 1.0 μm group also had significant decreases in body length and average lifespan. Microplastic exposure resulted in an increase in number of head thrashes and body bends in the 0.5 µm group but decreases in locomotion for the other treatment groups. However, exposure to 2.0 μm PS led to significant increases in mean crawling speed. Exposure to microplastics led to damage in cholinergic neurons (i.e., broken ciliated dendrites) in all treatment groups, indicating a downregulation of unc-17 (encodes acetylcholine in cholinergic neurons). Damage to GABAergic neurons was also seen in the 1.0 μm group. PS microplastics upregulated the expression of gst-4 (encodes glutathione S-transferase-4, a key enzyme involved in oxidative stress).||Lei et al. 2018a|

|Ennucula tenuis (Bivalve) Abra nitida (Saltwater clam) 4 weeks||PE fragments (size ranges of 4–6 µm, 20–25 µm, 125–500 µm) at 1 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, and 25 mg/kg dry sediment A low background contamination with perfluorooctane sulfonate was found in microplastics Control group was exposed to clean sediment||No significant changes in mortality, condition index, or burrowing behaviour were seen between treatments in both species. In E. tenuis, there were no significant changes in protein and carbohydrate content. However, there was a significant reduction in lipid content (64%) for individuals exposed to 20–25 µm at 10 mg/kg. In addition, a dose-dependent decrease in total energy was evident in all size groups. In A. nitida, there was a significant decrease in protein content from individuals exposed to 125–500 µm PE. Apparent, but not significant, changes in lipid content, carbohydrate content, and total energy were seen.||Bour et al. 2018|
|Perinereis aibuhitensis (Clamworm) 4 weeks||PS microspheres (size ranges of 8–12 μm and 32–38 μm) at 100 beads/mL and 1 000 beads/mL (nominal) Control group was exposed to 0.45 μm-filtered seawater without microplastic||The presence of microplastics increased mortality in P. aibuhitensis, with 8–12 μm microbeads having a significantly higher effect than the other treatments. For example, exposure to 8–12 μm microspheres at 100 beads/mL led to an average survival of 38% compared to over 80% in the control. Segment regeneration was size-dependent, with the slowest rate being observed in worms exposed to 8–12 μm (smaller size) microspheres at 1 000 beads/mL. Regeneration was 8.3 ± 1.4% for this group, compared to 20.7 ± 2.5% in the control group. In addition, worms exposed to a lower concentration of microplastics displayed a higher percent of segment regenerated.||Leung and Chan 2018|
|Hyalella azteca (Amphipod) Asellus aquaticus (Isopod) Sphaerium corneum (Bivalve) Lumbriculus variegatus (Worm) Tubifex spp. (Worm) 28 days||Irregular PS fragments (20–500 μm) mixed with sediment at 0.1%, 1%, 5%, 10%, 20%, 30% and 40% sediment dw Control group was exposed to sediment without microplastic||In H. azteca, A. aquaticus, S. corneum, and Tubifex spp., microplastics had no significant effect on mortality at all test concentrations. In Lumbriculus variegatus, no effects were found on reproduction (measured as reproduction factor). No differences in growth were seen in A. aquaticus, S. corneum, H. azteca, L. variegatus, and Tubifex spp. In H. azteca, there were no differences in feeding activity at all concentrations. In L. variegatus and Tubifex spp., microplastic exposure had no negative effect on egestion. No microplastics were found in the body and fecal pellets of H. azteca.||Redondo-Hasselerharm et al. 2018|
|Chironomus tepperi (Sediment dwelling midge) 5 day growth assay and 10 day emergence assay||Blue/white PE microplastics (size ranges of 1–4 µm, 10–27 µm, 43–54 µm, 100–126 µm) at 500 particles/kg sediment Control group was exposed to unspiked sediment; additional control assays using moderately hard water with and without Tween-20 (surfactant) were also conducted to ensure that larvae were appropriately sensitive and Tween-20 did not affect results||Using a 5-day growth assay, survival rates of midges exposed to microplastics were size-dependent, and the effects were found to be more pronounced with smaller particle sizes. Survival rate was the lowest in the 10–27 µm (57% survival) treatment group in comparison to the control (92% survival). Exposure to the highest tested concentration did not have any significant effect on survival. A size-dependent effect was also seen in larvae growth, where exposure to smaller microplastics led to significant decreases in body length. Exposure to 10–27 µm also led to the smallest body length (7.6 ± 2.4 mm) compared to the control (12.9 ± 3.1 mm). No significant changes were seen for the 100–126 µm group. The length of larvae head capsule was not affected by exposure to any treatment, with the exception of 10–27 µm, which had a significant reduction in mean head capsule length. SEM imaging also revealed reductions in the size of the head capsule and mouth for this group. It is hypothesized that the 10–27 µm particles had the greatest effects since they are the ideal size for consumption and to avoid egestion. Using a 10-day emergence assay, it was found that exposure to microplastics negatively affected the total number of emerged adults. There was a significant reduction in emergence rate for all microplastic size ranges. For the 10–27 µm group, the emergence rate was only 17.5%, compared to 92% in the control.||Ziajahromi et al. 2018|
|Caenorhabditis elegans (Nematode) 2 days||For C. elegans, concentrations of 0.5 mg/m2, 1.0 mg/m2, 5.0 mg/m2 and 10.0 mg/m2 were used For C. elegans, nematode growth medium agar seeded with Escherichia coli OP50 was used for the control group||In C. elegans, PA, PE, PP, and PVC microplastics had significant effects on their survival, with the exception of PVC at 0.5 mg/m2. PS particles displayed a significant size-dependent effect on lethality, with the 1.0 µm particles causing strong lethality and the 5.0 µm particles causing moderate lethality. In addition, exposure to 5.0 mg/m2 microplastics led to reductions in average body length and reproduction (embryo number and brood size). Microplastic exposure also led to decreased intestinal calcium levels and increased gst-4 expression. In C. elegans, 1.0 μm PS particles showed the highest toxicity, highest accumulation in the intestines, lowest Ca2+ level in the intestine, and greatest expression of gst-4 of the different sizes tested.||Lei et al. 2018b|
|Gammarus pulex (Amphipod) 28 days||Irregular PS fragments (20–500 μm) mixed with sediment at 0.1%, 1%, 5%, 10%, 20%, 30% and 40% sediment dwa Control group was exposed to sediment without microplastic||In G. pulex, microplastics had no significant effect on mortality at all test concentrations. G. pulex had a significant reduction in growth following exposure to high microplastic concentrations (10–40%) compared to controls. The EC50b value was determined to be 3.57% sediment dw (±3.22) and the EC10c value was 1.07%. There were no differences in feeding activity at all concentrations. In addition, G. pulex had microplastics present in the body and fecal pellets at all concentrations following a 24-hour depuration time. Uptake by G. pulex was found to be proportional to the concentration of microplastic in the sediment.||Redondo-Hasselerharm et al. 2018|

lscenv,https://www.lscenv.com/ ,"Landfill operational costs are ever increasing with many machines, laborers and fuel required to get the most out of cell life when utilizing bulky soil covers. Space is the most valuable commodity and operational costs continue to increase.
With Posi-Shell®, what once took 11 hours of labor, 11 hours of machine time and 150 gallons of fuel now takes 1 hour of labor, 1 hour of machine time, and 15 gallons of fuel. Plus, you achieve a 20% increase in cell life. How would your operation benefit from a dramatic increase in production and cost savings through our landfill cover solutions?
There are many instances where vegetation simply isn’t an option due to the changing of season or the need to coat ditches or trenches to divert storm water effectively. The challenge of erosion control can get even more complicated and expensive when contaminates are involved such as stock pile containment or radioactive soils.
Posi-Shell®'s erosion control coatings give engineers the ability to easily dial in durability specifications by adjusting formulations or application thickness. Whether looking to protect ditches, stabilize slopes, cover stockpiles, control siltation, or address any number of SWPPP requirements, nothing can match Posi-Shell®'s performance, cost, design flexibility, or speed of application.
Hydroseeding, with some products, is not as simple as it should be. Mixing, equipment clogs, and slow germination rates are just some of the challenges faced when hydroseeding. Slow germination rates alone can cause substantial associated issues like erosion and in some cases require re-application
Cube® is a single bag proprietary blend of mineral binders and virgin wood fibers that forms an instant, and intimate contact with any surface. With no manual or mechanical pre-shredding necessary, faster germination rates, and superior erosion protection, your operations will see instant cost and time savings.
Odors from waste sites can cause problems that go beyond a simple inconvenience. Odors that invade residential areas can cause lawsuits and public relation nightmares along with the related expense of testing solutions for odor containment which may or may not be effective.
Odor-Shell®, a patented, natural clay odor filter infused with neutralizers, adheres to any surface, is effective in wet or cured forms, and can be used in any type of weather condition. Mixed product can be used effectively over several days. Its unique properties enable the use of durability enhancers to achieve coatings that perform for up to a year.
Regardless of whether you manage a large mining operation, run trucks over a haul road, or perhaps operate a dirt track racing venue, dust can be a constant problem. Dust becomes more than just a nuisance when dealing with dangerous particulates that can become health hazards when airborne, such as fly ash or mining waste.
Posi-Clear® eliminates nuisance dust by bonding surface fines into a cohesive layer, therefore delivering long-lasting protection for expansive windswept areas. It also significantly reduces watering frequency on heavily trafficked haul roads. Posi-Clear® is the perfect solution for managers of fly ash monofills, industrial waste facilities, solid waste landfills, remediation projects, quarries, and mines.
Our nimble ECA Series Applicators are designed to allow easy transport on public roads. They are typically used on smaller sites or for contractors who move from project to project.
Our heavy-duty PSA Series Applicators are designed to withstand the most rugged conditions and are typically employed in large construction, industrial, or landfill operations.
With a 50-ton storage capacity, this portable, diesel powered unit, receives product from pneumatic delivery tankers and precisely unloads into application units with a simple flip of a switch. The Silo keeps hardeners protected in even the harshest of climates and loading time is less than 5 minutes.
We're here to help. Tell us about your current operations, your challenges and your goals and we'll match our products and services to help get you there.
Working at a zero tolerance facility means the product we use must work. Posi-Shell has been in use on the Washington Closure site since 2006 satisfying our emissions requirement
Your product (Posi-Cube) does what you guys say it does. It stays on slopes, holds moisture for germination, and is easy to mix and apply. It has been an important part of a successful seeding program and for erosion control at our site.
Our landfill converted from dirt daily cover material to Posi-Shell in 2012. What an exceptional product! It was an easy transition that not only saves us thousands of dollars per year, but also conserves valuable landfill space. We would highly recommend this product. .

Implementing 'Zero Trust' in a Hybrid Cloud Environment
Implementing the ""zero trust"" model in a hybrid cloud environment presents challenges, says Rajpreet Kaur, senior principal analyst at Gartner, who recommends a phased approach.

“Try to identify the key risk which you would want to secure, the immediate technology which you will require to secure it and then select a vendor who supports your other technologies as well to achieve zero trust,” Kaur says.
In this video interview with Information Security Media Group, Kaur also discusses:
- Challenges of achieving a complete zero trust framework;
- Emerging technologies to use in implementing a zero trust architecture;
- How SASE works in a zero trust environment.

More than 1 billion children are at risk of falling behind due to school closures aimed at containing the spread of COVID-19. To keep the world’s children learning, countries have been implementing remote education programmes. Yet many of the world’s children – particularly those in poorer households – do not have internet access, personal computers, TVs or even radio at home, amplifying the effects of existing learning inequalities. Students lacking access to the technologies needed for home-based learning have limited means to continue their education. As a result, many face the risk of never returning to school, undoing years of progress made in education around the world.
With school closures across 188 countries (as of April 2020), many of them are exploring alternative ways to provide continuous education using technologies such as Internet, TV, and radio. However, access to these technologies is limited in many low- and middle-income countries, especially among poor households.
- While more than 90 per cent of the countries adopted digital and/or broadcast remote learning policies, only 60 per cent did so for pre-primary education. [†]
- Policy measures taken by the governments to ensure learning continuity through broadcast or digital media allowed for potentially reaching 69 per cent of schoolchildren (at maximum) in pre-primary to secondary education globally.[†]
- 31 per cent of schoolchildren worldwide (463 million) cannot be reached by the broadcast- and Internet-based remote learning policies either due to the lack of necessary technological assets at home, or because they were not targeted by the adopted policies. [†]
- Online platforms were the most used means by the governments to deliver education while schools remain closed, with 83 per cent of countries using this method. However, this allowed for potentially reaching only about a quarter of schoolchildren worldwide. [†]
- Television had the potential to reach the most students (62 per cent) globally.
- Only 16 per cent of schoolchildren could be reached by radio-based learning worldwide. [†]
- Globally, 3 out of 4 students who cannot be reached by the remote learning policies come from rural areas and/or belong to the poorest households. [†]
Considering these data, it is important that countries do not rely on any single remote learning channel to reach all children. Additionally, expanding access to Internet and other digital solutions for all children would be one key long-term priority to reduce learning vulnerabilities.

These global goals include a commitment to ensure that, by the year 2030, all children will have equitable access to quality early childhood development and early learning opportunities.
SDG indicator 4.2.1 was chosen to specifically monitor the impact of government action towards this target, and UNICEF was tasked to lead the development of a measure to track progress.
That same year, UNICEF initiated a process of methodological development that involved extensive consultations with experts, partner agencies and national statistical authorities. Over the following five years, a sequence of carefully planned technical activities were executed, incorporating both qualitative and quantitative methods to identify the best items to measure indicator 4.2.1. This process led to the development of the ECDI2030.
The ECDI2030 captures the achievement of key developmental milestones by children between the ages of 24 and 59 months. Mothers or primary caregivers are asked 20 questions about the way their children behave in certain everyday situations, and the skills and knowledge they have acquired.
The ECDI2030 addresses the need for nationally representative and internationally comparable data on early childhood development, collected in a standardized way. The module can be integrated into existing national data collection efforts. It is accompanied by standard guidance and a framework for technical assistance to support implementation. And because the data can be disaggregated by key demographics and subnational areas, the use of this measure can also help advance the SDG commitment to leave no one behind.
The ECDI2030 questionnaire has been translated into multiple languages and, in addition to English, is available in Arabic, Chinese, French, Portuguese, Portuguese (Brazilian), Russian, and Spanish (see Resources below).
Currently available supporting dissemination materials include an advocacy video. A package of implementation tools to support country uptake of the ECDI2030 is also under development. These materials include a quick implementation guide, manual for interviewers, frequently asked questions, guidelines for integration into household surveys, customization and translation guidelines, training materials, series of slide deck templates for different target audiences, syntaxes, tabulation plans, and templates for reporting.

As families lose their sources of income and home environments are turned upside down due to the socioeconomic impacts of COVID-19, children find themselves more vulnerable to poverty and likely to be deprived of their basic needs. For the poorest families, including those who do not have access to social protection, the situation is dire. Children suffer poverty differently from adults and they are more likely to experience lifelong consequences from it. Malnutrition can last a lifetime, having long-term consequences on children’s physical, social and emotional development. And losses in learning at a young age can result in children falling behind in school, finding it difficult to ever catch up. Without access to health care, children could miss out on vaccines that could be life-saving in later years and the treatment necessary to grow up healthy and thrive. In addition, children are placed at greater risk of child marriage, violence, exploitation and abuse.
Available data on the impact of unemployment and the loss of parents’ income due to the COVID-19 pandemic are not disaggregated by age and therefore do not reflect the realities faced by children around the world. In response to this gap, Save the Children and UNICEF collaborated to estimate how many children live in monetary poor households as well as how many more are likely to be pushed into this situation due to the impact of the pandemic. The analysis projects the likely change in the number of children in monetary poor families due to COVID-19, under different scenarios based on likely reductions of per capita income and changes in income distribution.
The global socioeconomic crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic could push 142 million more children into monetary poor households by the end of the year, according to projections as of November 2020. The total number of children living in poor households globally could reach just over 725 million in the absence of any mitigating policies. Nearly two-thirds of these children live in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. . ",True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False

To support evidence-based policymaking and research in the transport sector, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) and the World Bank have developed a Global Transport Costs dataset for International Trade.
In order to provide a more visual understanding of global transport costs related to international trade, an interactive map has been created to visualize the transport costs of individual commodities traded between two countries in 2016.
The handbook usually presents a wide variety of statistics relevant to international trade and development for the preceding year. The coronavirus pandemic however transformed business as usual in 2020, increasing demand for up-to-date figures on the economic impacts. To anticipate the figures for the year of publication, the handbook has been supplemented by quarterly trade nowcasts which paint a picture of the decline that occurred in trade in both goods and services, with the figures still trending downwards at time of publication. These and other major trends in statistics relevant to international trade and development are depicted in UNCTAD's 2020 Handbook of Statistics.
The coronavirus pandemic led to a 3% drop in global trade values in the first quarter of 2020. The downturn is expected to accelerate in the second quarter, according to UNCTAD forecasts, which project a quarter-on-quarter decline of 27%.

3dprint,https://3dprint.com/271/3-ways-3d-printing-will-save-the-environment/ https://3dprint.com/268538/the-sustainability-of-3d-printing-myth-or-reality/ ,"Technological progress has been on both ends of the environmental spectrum. On one hand the further use of technology can cause dregradation within the natural environment, while on the other hand, it can be it’s savior. As we progress into the 21st century, never before have we had so many possible environmental catastrophies building on the horizon. At the same time though, never before have we been on the brink of such progress that nearly every environmental problem could potentially be avoided, and solved.
3D printing is just one of the many advances in technology that will lead to a healthier environment around the world. Here are three major ways in which this technology will usher in a cleaner, purer, safer world around us:
#1 Wide Spread Recycling at Our Fingertips
In the Late 80’s and early 90’s we saw a major shift towards recycling waste. Curbside bins were handed out to residents in most areas around the nation, and people began to think twice before throwing out certain items. This was due to advances in technology allowing for recycling plants to flourish. Fast forward 20-30 years and we are at the starting line of another major recycling revolution. Plastics, as well as eventually metals and other materials can be ground up and turned into filament for 3D printers. Over the last year or so, there has been a movement underway to do this. Perpetual Plastic is one of these movements, as well as others like the Filabot, which received over 300% of it’s goal in funding on Kickstarter back in 2012. Basically anyone with the proper tools can throw a used plastic bottle into a machine, and after a few steps turn that into any of tens of millions of different items. If that’s not something to get excited about, nothing is. Scientists as well as do-it-yourselfers are also working with metals, wood materials, and glass to push forward similar initiatives.
#2 Reduction in Fossil Fuel Use From Shipping
Every day millions of barrels of oils are used shipping items across the world. Whether it’s a UPS truck, Fedex 747, freight train, or cargo ship, global trade is a huge business. Millions of people every day order off of interest sites like Amazon, and receive their products within 2 days time. That takes a lot of fuel. Where there is fuel, there is pollution. 3D printing is already helping to cut back on shipments in many industries. Thus far, it’s barely made a dent in the amount of fuel needed each day within the shipping industry, however, trends show it will make a significant dent within the coming decade. Today you can 3D print your child a toy, yourself a smartphone case, or your loved ones jewelry, instead of having to order those items online and paying to have them shipped, or jumping into your vehicle and running to the local Walmart. In the future, almost everything will be able to be printed out, cutting costs, saving time, and most importantly preserving the environment.
#3 Far Less Waste
Finally, 3D printers are cutting back on waste within the manufacturing industry. 3D printing is also known as “additive manufacturing.” That’s because it does just that, slowly adds material to an item until it is complete. Most other manufacturing methods are subtractive. For instance, when you build a chair out of wood, you don’t use ever single shred of lumber in that chair. You have scraps as well as saw dust left over. Same thing for
just about anything that is manufactured these days. You almost always have waste material, which nine times out of ten, winds up in a landfill, or somewhere even worse. 3D printers will save money for manufacturers, but most importantly cut back substantially on waste. Many companies include General Electric, Apple, and Ford are already using, or have plans to use 3D printing within their manufacturing facilities.
Most people are afraid of technology, in that they feel it will lead to the worlds demise. In my opinion technology will solve some of the most unsolvable problems we face today. Embrace it to the fullest!

Upload your 3D Models and get them printed quickly and efficiently. . Historically, quality, cost and delivery have been the primary drivers for decision making within manufacturing. Today, another word is on the minds of executives: Sustainability.
Sustainability is increasingly important in consumer decision making, with younger consumers flocking to brand that are “greener” than their competition. Sustainability initiatives can blunt the effects of fluctuations in energy prices and availability of material resources. And tracking to sustainability KPIs enables companies to get ahead of regulation that will penalize their carbon footprints. Regardless of your sector, sustainability must be a core part of your business.
A common claim is that 3D printing enables a more sustainable supply chain: By enabling manufacturing at the point of use, 3D printing reduces the carbon footprint that would naturally occur due to part transportation. 3D printing is a low-waste process, requiring less raw material compared to subtractive manufacturing methods. A search of the literature has produced a limited number of studies accounting for the entire life cycle of 3D printed parts.
So, we actually tested this theory: we compared the life cycle of a mass manufactured injection molded part produced in China and a locally 3D-printed part.
Experiment Methodology
Using a generic car mobile phone holder as a case study, we developed a methodology to compare the carbon footprints of centralized and distributed manufacturing for cheap, mass-produced products.
We purchased a phone holder from a supplier in China through Amazon and analyzed the entire supply chain, from processing the polymer pellets in the injection molding machine to the part arriving at our doorstep. We also examined the entire process chain for the 3D printed counterpart, produced on a consumer 3D printer.
The results, as defined by the total carbon footprint, were as follows:
|Mass Manufactured (Kg CO2)||3D Printing (Kg CO2)|
|Material||1.035||1.260|
|Manufacturing||0.150||0.480|
|Transport||0.017||0.001|
|Life Usage||0.180||0.200|
|Total||1.382||1.941|
While 3D printing required less energy in transportation, it used much more energy in production. This result is typical: Often, 3D printing machines require 10x the energy to process 1KG of material compared to injection molding and 100x compared to CNC machining.
A casual observer might note from the images above that the 3D-printed part required printing additional material that does not end up in the final part. These “support structures” are often a necessary part of the 3D printing process. Build errors can also be common (especially in consumer-level 3D printers) and our analysis takes that into account. With experience in 3D printing, both support structures and build risk can be reduced, but not eliminated entirely.
Reviewing the results of the carbon footprint during the transportation phase, the mass manufactured part travelled from a port in China to our location, while the 3D printed part travelled minimally (i.e. ABS from the factory to our office,) resulting in a significant difference.
Finally, the actual life usage carbon foot print was relatively similar between the two (50 vs 54g, respectively), simply because the weight of each part was within a margin of error.
So, 3D printing is not sustainable?
Clearly, the widely-accepted talking point that 3D printing is inherently more sustainable than traditional manufacturing is false. As we showed with the phone holder, often mass manufacturing is both more economically viable and more sustainable, especially for parts that require large volumes and can be produced by traditional manufacturing.
Our example exposes a wider problem with how engineers and organizations think about adopting new technologies. In our experiment, we took a common, mass-produced part that was designed for injection molding, “hit print” and analyzed the results. In an effort to show a relatable use case, we simplified too much, but in doing so we demonstrated a larger, more important point: 3D printing isn’t a drop-in replacement for traditional manufacturing, but we often treat it that way because we don’t know any better.
We’d go even further to say that, if you’re not planning on taking advantage of specific capabilities of 3D printing, you shouldn’t bother; 3D printing very rarely provides advantages as a drop-in replacement to traditional manufacturing.
If 3D printing isn’t a drop-in replacement, how do we start using it in ways that make sense? Using 3D printing to drive sustainability requires understanding what these tools can do, how to best deploy them, and where they can fill in the holes in your business model. We need to start Thinking AdditivelyTM.
First, consider the design freedoms available with 3D printing. Utilize the design freedoms of additive to optimize the part, whilst maintaining structural requirements and achieving an acceptable cost. By Thinking Additively, designers can unlock three primary benefits:
- Less Material – Less raw material is needed to create the part and build support structures. The less material needed, the lower the fossil fuel consumption and associated energy.
- Less Processing – Less material handling and post-processing directly correlates to less energy required to print the part.
- Less Weight – Lighter weight parts directly reduce greenhouse gas emissions both during transportation and life usage.
In our case, after redesigning the phone holder, we found we could reduce the weight from 54g to 32g, resulting in a 40% carbon footprint reduction, or 15% lower carbon footprint than injection molding.
Second, explore what additive can do for the way you design and develop products. Thinking about additive as a drop-in replacement gets us prototypes, but truly Thinking Additively opens up many more possibilities to both iterate internally faster and to bring customers into the design process.
In traditional manufacturing, once design is finalized, tooling is created, production begins at scale, and iterating becomes vastly more expensive; any change can mean scrapping and recreating tooling, discarding thousands of already-produced pieces, or re-stocking warehouses across the globe.
Your early adopter customers are often the most critical, but also the most invested in your product, yet using traditional manufacturing means that the waste inherent in change grows exponentially just before you have access to the truest feedback on your product. This is not the case with additive; as lower economic production quantities mean that you can pivot quickly, with reduced waste.
Finally, start Thinking Additively about your business model. Additive can improve the sustainability of the entire lifecycle of your product. Some additional green aspects of 3D printing may include:
- Reduced Inventory: While we have explained the financial benefits of spare parts, by not having warehouses full of inventory saves on raw material usage, storage energy and arguably saving on throwing away parts after sitting on shelves for years.
- Material Processing: The arrival of global materials manufacturers in the 3D printing space (e.g. Solvay, BASF) will likely make material processing more efficient due to economies of scale.
- Product Efficiency: The benefit doesn’t stop once the part is manufactured. Improving efficiency can make processes more sustainable (e.g. improved fuel nozzle designs equate to improved fuel efficiencies). Moreover, thanks to design freedoms, assembly can be manufactured with single parts in the same material making the product more recyclable.
- Repair and Refurbishment: Because 3D printing works by adding material on top of a layer, it is well suited for repairing components. Parts can be fixed by adding material where needed; previously disposable parts can be economically repairable.
- Waste into production materials: Because 3D printing can use recycled materials more readily than traditional manufacturing, it opens up the potential for circular economies, where waste can be reprocessed into entirely new products, such as recycling 3D printed prototypes back into feedstock for new prototypes.
In summary, 3D printing can be a green manufacturing method, but truly unlocking its potential as a sustainability enabler in your business requires Thinking Additively. As a user, you must understand when, where, and how to deploy the tool not only in product design, but throughout your product’s lifecycle. The business value of 3D printing is rarely in simply producing a cheaper part, but rather in a combination of lead time reduction, risk mitigation, and supply chain efficiencies. Similarly, with the sustainability of 3D printing, the environmental value of 3D printing is found in low volume manufacturing, reduced inventory, and reduced material waste.
The largest irony in this is that the 3D printer OEMs have a lot to learn about how the tools they created can drive sustainability within their own businesses. In many ways these companies see themselves as traditional manufacturers of industrial machinery and are consequently change-averse. Perhaps the biggest leap forward in using 3D printing as a sustainability enabler could be driven by the 3D printer OEMs themselves if they adopted sustainability as a core strategy and drove their business to sustainability KPIs. Often the best way to catalyze change is by leading by example.

Our global supply chains mean we can source from farmers for customers around the world, as well as supply the Nigerian domestic market directly from our 10,000-hectare rice farm.
The constant focus on the safety and security of our supplies have been critical to our success. Given increasing global population and environmental challenges we are also working with partners to support farmers on more sustainable production.
Since our operations began in 2006, we have expanded into almost every rice exporting country outside the United States.
Our origin teams are spread across India, Thailand, and Vietnam, as well as dedicated agents in Brazil, Argentina, Pakistan, and Myanmar. Focused on buying the best rice, they work with secure counter parties, and offer flexible contracting and strong logistics in developing markets. Our farmer training and processing expertise helps us to closely monitor and ensure that the rice maintains its quality throughout the entire operational process.
“Because our distribution network has such deep roots, and our operations are highly integrated, we have exceptional insight into the demand and supply requirements in each country. Coupled with our focus on long standing partnerships, we have a strong foundation on which to build our rice business.”
Olam has partnered with German development agency GIZ and the Thai Rice Department to work with farmers, so that we can ensure the quality of their rice and make sure it’s traceable.
At our facility in Thailand we aggregate, sort and pack over 100,000 tonnes of rice every year. This facility is certified and approved by GMP-HACCP, GMP-FDA and Thailand Trust Mark (TTM).
Our joint venture in Vietnam gives us a firm understanding of what it means to mill quality rice for global consumers. Our rice mill has an annual capacity of 150,000 tonnes, and is certified by BRC Category A, and ISO 22000.
Our laboratory ensures specification and certification, with flexibility for customers. We are able to offer targeted solutions to match precise demand requirements.
Our distribution has experienced unprecedented growth. From our roots in Nigeria over 30 years ago selling unbranded rice, we now have brands that top the popularity charts in each of our three main countries of operation.
With extensive warehousing and networks in destination markets, we are a strategic partner in the rice trade. Our end-to-end supply chain has seen several recognised brands go onto supermarket shelves, with increasing market penetration. The success of these rice brands is reflective of our insight into a diversity of markets, and our ability to cater to the exacting standards of varied consumer groups.
We are committed to the UN Sustainable Development Goal 2: Zero Hunger and in an effort to meet the nutritional needs of undernourished consumers in our destination markets, we are working with DSM to develop and distribute fortified rice.
We offer a variety of brands, including Royal Aroma, Royal Feast and Mama Africa in Ghana; Mama’s Pride and Mama Africa in Nigeria, Riz Meme Casse and Bijou in Cameroon; and Royal Aroma and Mama Africana in Mozambique.
Innovation in rice farming is essential. We have introduced a fully mechanised large-scale rice farm in Nigeria that produces two crops a year for the Nigerian market, helping the country to reduce reliance on imports.
Our farm has an integrated rice mill with a processing capacity of 70,000 tonnes. This farm acts as a centre for improving productivity, and also as a vocational training hub for thousands of smallholders from nearby communities. Through our rice mill, farmers can process their crop, and gain access to market, improving local livelihoods.
We have advanced agronomic practices tailored to the African growing climate and have achieved a doubling overall farm yields from 1.5 to almost 4 tonnes per hectare per season, together with better land use and more rice-farming employment. Building strong relationships with the right partners to source better inputs, and creating planting and irrigation training programmes, also improves the productivity of the farmers in our outgrower initiatives.
In 2013, The Rockefeller Foundation highlighted the rice farm as a “catalytic innovation in African agriculture”.

These capitals are not universally assessed in current reporting frameworks, despite driving a significant portion of a company’s market value, so we challenged ourselves to re-imagine business reporting.
In 2017, in our first Integrated Annual Report, we began reporting against these 6 non-financial Capitals to help demonstrate how they contribute to the creation of Long-Term Value for Olam as well as create value for our stakeholders. During 2018, the Integrated Reporting Task Force (a cross functional team) was formed to evaluate our approach to multi-capital accounting. The team was tasked with establishing a numerical link to sustainability using multi-capital accounting methodologies, they went on to develop the Integrated Impact Statement (IIS).
In 2018, we piloted the initial IIS tool with 3 of our business units - Dairy (Russia), Cocoa (Côte d’Ivoire) and Palm (Gabon), covering Natural, Social and Human capital. The tool was also independently validated and shared with experts for their input and further refinement.
In 2019, we created a dedicated ‘Finance for Sustainability’ (F4S) department to further develop the multi-capital accounting methodologies, to act as a centre of excellence, and to help embed capitals accounting within the organisation. F4S will leverage the expertise of Finance and Accounting to help address the most pressing supply chain sustainability issues. To enhance business decision making, the Integrated Impact Statement is also being deployed at profit centre level.
F4S will uncover hidden costs and benefits not previously reported, support the leveraging of sustainable financing to address the most pressing supply chain sustainability issues and help support the business to ‘re-imagine agriculture’. Our vision is to be a best-in-class business partner, responsible for maximising long-term intrinsic value for all our stakeholders using non-financial drivers of value.
|Internalisation of externalities||Accountants’ culture and mindset change||Common numerical language|
|F4S will internalise externalities via our Business Units, supporting strategic financial business decisions and influencing significant stakeholders. Bringing finance and sustainability concepts together.||With no formal framework for measuring these Capitals, we needed a better way to measure, quantify and report our long-term ‘invisible’ value. F4S will create partnerships and collaborations to grow this mindset.||We use a common numerical language, where applicable, that everyone can understand, evaluate and articulate. IIS allows Olam to explain the impact of our actions on the ground to all internal and external stakeholders.|
“Sustainability is at the heart of Olam. The IIS gives finance and business teams the needed numerical link between actions on the ground and their impact and dependency on the Capitals. This will help in both improving the understanding of the Capitals and in taking necessary steps towards increasing the long-term value for the company.”
The IIS takes a systems approach that captures the complexity and reality of today’s diverse and intertwined ‘eco-agrifood’ systems, providing a holistic picture to business decision-making, avoiding the risks and limitations inherent in simplistic metrics such as ‘productivity per hectare’ which ignores Natural Capital stocks, flows, outcomes and impacts. The IIS approach will increase business resilience, allowing Olam to make changes on the ground, to mitigate the risks associated with carbon taxes, biodiversity loss or procurement concerns. Uncovering these risks and opportunities, will enable us to better prepare and respond to the challenges of tomorrow.
We believe the IIS will positively change and differentiate the way we operate and with whom. We are better informed about our Natural, Social and Human Capital impact and can provide actionable management information to better understand key impact areas (by farmer group, by country, by commodity), and devise more appropriate plans to address externalities and enhance positive impacts. Olam endeavours to become a resilient and more reliant partner for all our stakeholders by ensuring Long-Term Value creation.
The Capitals drive Long-Term Value and underpin a significant portion of a company’s market value. The Integrated Impact Statement is a decision-making tool which allows Olam to manage Long-Term Value. This tool will help embed sustainability concepts, such as multi-capital accounting, into the heart of our business, through finance.
The IIS tool is made up of 3 elements - Profit and Loss; Balance Sheet; and Risk and Opportunity Statement; and covers 3 Capitals;
- Natural Capital: The land, water, biodiversity and other ecosystem services required for food, feed and fibre production. This includes the accounting for renewable and non-renewable environmental resources that Olam is dependent upon for its long-term sustainable operations and associated externalities.
- Social Capital: The relationships we forge and nurture for long-term commercial success. This includes the accounting for external stakeholders in society - community, institutions and Olam’s contributions to those relationships through its community-based programmes.
- Human Capital: The talent, skills, dedication and inspiration of our workforce & management and our responsibilities towards them. This includes the accounting for all internal stakeholders, our workforce and management, that Olam relies on and contributes to through training & capacity building, safe & healthy workplace where rights are respected.
Like a control tower, the IIS decision-making tool effectively reports and allows Olam to manage long-term value.
The Integrated Impact Statement leverages existing frameworks by Accounting for Sustainability, the Capitals Coalition and The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity for Agriculture and Food (TEEBAgriFood).
Source of framework: Capitals Coalition (https://capitalscoalition.org/)
F4S in 2019 developed the Integrated Impact Statement for the Cocoa business. A summary of some insights from Cocoa’s Integrated Impact Statement on key aspects of Natural Capital is presented in Olam’s Annual Report 2019.
The insights from IIS can positively change and differentiate the way we operate and with whom we operate. We are now better informed about our Natural, Social and Human Capital impact and can provide actionable management information to enable our Business Units to better understand their key impact areas (by Farmer Group level, by country, by commodity), and devise more appropriate plans. This way Olam endeavours to become a resilient and more reliant partner for all our stakeholders by ensuring Long-Term Value creation.
The IIS Natural Capital valuation scope is detailed in the table below.
|Indicator||Valuation Scope||Main Data||Valuation||Cost /|
|Country||Watershed||Biome|
|Land Use||Y||Farmed||Gain in biome specific benefits (Ecosystem||Benefit|
|GHG||Y||Total GHG||Social cost of carbon||Cost|
|GHG||Y||Carbon Sequestered||Benefit of sequestered carbon||Benefit|
|Water||Y||Water||Human and ecosystem damage cost||Cost|
|Water||Y||Fertiliser||Human damage cost||Cost|
The Olam Integrated Impact Statement is not related to financial results or financial reporting. All underlying methodologies are based on well-established databases and frameworks but as they depend on formula and third-party expert studies, they can only ever be an approximation. The results are for internal purposes only. In the coming years, results could be readjusted according to further methodological refinements. Taken together, however, the IIS is a valuable sustainability tool that can help uncover issues and provoke questions necessary to Re-imagine Global Agriculture and Food Systems.

We therefore report against our sustainability goals in our Annual Reports which are housed in the Investor Library.
We use the Global Reporting Initiative as a guidance framework, and also endeavour to incorporate stakeholder focus areas.
We also take a Capitals approach, reporting under Manufactured, Human, Social, Natural, Intangible and Intellectual Capital. Our Finance for Sustainability Function (F4S) has also developed the Olam Integrated Impact Statement (IIS) – a tool for multi-capital accounting. In 2019, F4S developed the IIS for the Cocoa business to support their Cocoa Compass sustainability strategy. A summary of some insights from Cocoa’s IIS on key aspects of Natural Capital (NC) is presented in the 2019 Annual Report.
In addition to annual reporting, we also report against other initiatives such as CDP and product specific initiatives such as Cocoa and Forests Initiative. We are signatories to the ten Principles of the UN Global Compact.

FAQ
- What does Ørsted do?
Ørsted is the global-leader in offshore wind power, and supplies large-scale and cost-competitive offshore wind energy, onshore wind energy, and solar energy solutions. In parallel, Ørsted operates sustainable bioenergy plants, offers renewable power purchase agreements, and is exploring renewable hydrogen solutions.
- Where does Ørsted operate?Ørsted’s global footprint is expanding. We operate across Europe – in the UK, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, Poland, and Denmark, where we have our global headquarters – as well as in the US, and in Asia, where we work in Taiwan, Malaysia, Korea and Japan.
- What makes Ørsted the world’s most sustainable energy company?Ørsted has been the world’s most sustainable energy company in Corporate Knights’ Global 100 index of most sustainable companies in 2019, 2020, and 2021. In 2020, Ørsted was ranked the world’s most sustainable company, and in 2021 it is ranked in second place overall.
- How is Ørsted fighting climate change?Roughly 73% of global emissions that cause climate change come from the use of energy, mainly through burning of fossil fuels for power, heat, cooling, transportation and industrial processes. This means that the global transition to renewable energy is one of the most important ways of fighting climate change.
At Ørsted, we’ve been at the forefront of the massive global expansion of offshore wind over recent decades, and today we also provide onshore wind and solar power , as well as exploring new green energy technologies like renewable hydrogen and green fuels.
Thanks to our green transformation, we’re well ahead of schedule in terms of the science-based carbon-reduction targets to meet the terms of the Paris agreement. Now we want to help other companies and countries undergo their own green transformations, working together to create a world that runs entirely on green energy
- What was Ørsted’s green transformation?Ørsted used to be one of the most coal-intensive companies in Europe, responsible for one-third of Denmark’s total carbon emissions. In 2008, we embarked on a green business transformation. As a result, today, we’re ranked the world’s most sustainable energy company, almost all of our profit comes from renewable energy, and we’re on track to be carbon neutral by 2025.
- How did Ørsted get its name?
Ørsted is named after Hans Christian Ørsted, the Danish scientist who discovered electromagnetism in 1820. His discovery would go on to form the basis for the way in which we power the modern world, for example using wind turbines. Hans Christian Ørsted’s curiosity, passion, and interest in nature encompass everything we need to create a world that runs entirely on green energy. . Latest news

Under the 2015 Paris Agreement, nations pledged to keep the average global temperature rise to below 2C above pre-industrial levels and to take efforts to narrow that increase to 1.5 C. To meet those goals we must not only stop the increase in our greenhouse gas emissions, we must also draw large amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere.
The simplest, most cost effective and environmentally beneficial way to do this is right under our feet. We can farm carbon by storing it in our agricultural soils.
Soils are traditionally rich in carbon. They can contain as much as five per cent carbon by weight, in the form of soil organic matter – plant and animal matter in various stages of decomposition.
But with the introduction of modern agricultural techniques, including the plow, soil organic matter content has dropped by half in many areas of the world, including parts of Canada. That carbon, once stored in the ground, is now found in the atmosphere and oceans as CO2 and is contributing to global warming.
The organic compounds found in soil are the glue that hold soil particles together and help give the soil structure. Like the walls of a building, this structure creates openings and passageways that allow the soil to conduct and store water, contain air, resist soil erosion and provide a habitat for soil organisms.
Plowing breaks apart soil aggregates and allows microorganisms to eat the soil organic compounds. In the short-term, the increased microbial activity releases nutrients, boosting crop productivity. In the long-term the loss of structure reduces the soil’s ability to hold water and resist erosion. Ultimately, crop productivity drops.
How can we make soil organic matter?
First and foremost, we need to disturb soil less. The advent of no-till and reduced tillage methods have allowed us to increase the carbon content of soils.
No-till and direct-seeding methods place the seed directly into the soil, minimizing the disturbance associated with seedbed preparation. The lack of disturbance allows the roots and crop residues from the previous crops to form soil organic matter. It reduces the degradation of the soil organic matter already present in the soil.
In Canada, we are already benefiting from reduced tillage. In the Prairies, no-tillage agriculture has increased from less than five per cent of the land area in the early 1990s to almost 50 per cent in 2006.
The situation is a bit more complex in Eastern Canada. The region’s soil type and climate make it less easy to build soil organic matter. At Dalhousie’s Atlantic Soil Health Lab, we are exploring the potential of various cropping practices to increase soil organic matter content in the soils of Atlantic Canada. While the potential to store carbon may not be as great as in Western Canada, the benefits of increased soil organic matter content are far greater because of the critically low levels of organic matter.
Secondly, we can use more diverse crop rotations. Forage crops – such as grasses, clovers and alfalfa – penetrate the soil with extensive root systems that lead to the formation of soil organic matter. Short rotations dominated by crops that have poor root systems (corn, soybeans) are not effective in building soil organic matter.
Farmers can also build soil organic matter by adding organic amendments such as animal manure, composts, forestry residues (wood chips) or biosolids to the soil.
Using the right amount of fertilizer is also important. Fertilizers can improve plant growth, lead to larger roots and add more plant matter to the soil in the unharvested portion of the crop. However, too much nitrogen fertilizer can result in the production of the powerful greenhouse gas nitrous oxide and offset the benefit of increased soil organic matter formation.
Farmers need economic incentives
Project Drawdown, a non-profit organization that researches solutions to global warming, has estimated that global farmland restoration (building soil organic matter) could remove 14 gigatones (billion tonnes) of CO2.
This would reduce the CO2 in the atmosphere below the current 400 parts per million – a level unpassed for several million years – while developing more fertile, resilient soils to feed people for years to come and keep forests intact.
These approaches seem like obvious solutions. Why are they not more widely adopted? The short answer is economics.
The benefits of drawing down CO2 and building soil organic matter play out over decades. But the costs associated with these practices often do not have increased returns in the short-term.
Farmers often make decisions in response to short-term economic pressures and government policies. Improved soil management is a public good. We need economic tools and short-term incentives that encourage producers to adopt these practices for the good of all.

Last week, representatives of the world’s multilateral development institutions and member institutions of the International Development Finance Club reconvened in Paris for the One Planet Summit to reaffirm their commitment to the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change.
With development finance institutions increasingly focused on supporting the international climate agenda, it is a good time to reflect on the COP 23 climate conference in Bonn that I attended last month, and to analyze how ADB is contributing to some of the areas highlighted during the event.
ADB provided financial and advisory support for Fiji’s successful presidency of COP 23—a significant achievement for the country and one which has helped to raise awareness about climate threats faced by Pacific island nations.
The crucial issue of finance was hotly debated in Bonn, with developing countries insisting on more clarity and ambition from developed countries on financing commitments. But aside from modest replenishments of the Adaptation Fund—which targets mainly small-scale projects—and the Least Developed Countries Fund, governments made few new pledges.
The Green Climate Fund (GCF) was urged to make its financing instruments available to all countries, ensure timely disbursement of approved funding, and to launch its first replenishment process in 2018.
ADB’s deepening engagement on climate
ADB is broadening its engagement with the GCF. The institutions signed an Accreditation Master Agreement in August 2017. ADB is developing a robust pipeline of project proposals for submission in 2018, and has thus far secured nearly $75 million in GCF financing for ADB projects in its Pacific developing member countries.
ADB to double climate financing for Pacific to $500 million until 2020
With GCF financing, ADB will help to make a water supply system for Fiji’s capital Suva more climate-resilient, support seven Pacific countries to accelerate implementation of renewable energy and help ensure year-round connectivity for Nauru through the construction of climate-resilient port infrastructure.
Moreover, in line with its 2015 commitment to deliver $6 billion in climate finance annually by 2020 from its own resources, ADB will also double climate finance to its Pacific developing member countries to $500 million between 2017 and 2020.
In Bonn, some headway was made on the rules and procedures underpinning the Paris Agreement, commonly called the “Paris Rulebook”, particularly regarding Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), transparency, and carbon markets.
Regarding NDCs, which outline intended climate actions by countries and will be periodically reviewed and strengthened, discussions centered on the establishment of clear rules for NDC structuring, implementing, and updating.
I was happy to announce that ADB has joined the NDC Partnership, a grouping of around 65 countries and the European Union—among them 27 ADB members—and development organizations committed to supporting the implementation of ambitious NDCs.
Talanoa Dialogue supports achieving climate ambitions through collective action
ADB is working to launch a dedicated NDC support platform in 2018. This platform, for which $3 million in initial funding has been secured from ADB’s Climate Change Fund, is intended to support selected developing member countries in turning their NDCs into bankable climate investment plans.
Collective action to hit climate targets
Progress was made in Bonn on the sensitive issues of increasing transparency of financial flows and monitoring compliance of climate actions. The Talanoa Dialogue, a consultative dialogue set to continue throughout 2018, aims to support an open and constructive exchange on how climate ambitions can be enhanced through collective action.
For its part, in addition to reporting its overall annual climate investment and greenhouse gas footprint, ADB has begun to publicly disclose information on every project that involves climate mitigation or adaptation finance, a first among multilateral development banks.
Through its Climate Change Operational Framework 2017-2030, ADB has also committed to measuring and reducing its portfolio-level greenhouse gas emissions in line with efforts to limit global warming to 2°C.
ADB also requires that the social cost of carbon be considered in the economic analysis of projects. This valuation should apply to the difference in emissions between the with and without project scenarios. Based on a meta-analysis conducted for the IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report, a 2016 value of $36 per ton of CO2-equivalent emissions (rising 2% in real terms annually) is applied to reflect the marginal damage cost of emissions.
Though no text was adopted, there were some positive developments regarding the market mechanisms envisaged under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement. ADB has supported carbon pricing through its continued engagement with existing and emerging carbon markets by facilitating carbon finance through trust funds and capacity-building support for market-based opportunities in emissions reduction.
ADB to spur investments in climate-friendly technologies to achieve NDCs
These efforts will continue. ADB is committed to helping its developing member countries to use market mechanisms to incentivize investments in climate-friendly technologies for achieving their respective NDCs. At COP 23, ADB presented an assessment of its Future Carbon Fund projects, demonstrating strong linkages between investments in climate change mitigation projects and the delivery of sustainable development co-benefits.
Conversely, little progress was made on the issue of loss and damage, which seeks to address the disproportionate impact of climate change on countries that have made little historical contribution to the problem.
Helping the most vulnerable
Some of these impacts are becoming evident. ADB presented at COP 23 its flagship report A Region At Risk: The Human Dimensions of Climate Change in Asia and the Pacific, which outlines how climate change is already impacting human development in the region and underscores the importance of taking decisive climate action to help the most vulnerable.
To help countries cope, a major new initiative, the InsuResilience Global Partnership for Climate and Disaster Risk Finance and Insurance Solutions, was launched by the G20 countries in partnership with the so-called “Vulnerable 20”. The latter is a group of 43 climate vulnerable countries-18 of which are ADB developing member countries- which aims to help an additional 400 million poor and vulnerable people gain access to climate risk and insurance solutions.
ADB is supporting the aims of the partnership through the Asia-Pacific Climate Finance Fund (ACliFF), a new trust fund to increase developing countries’ access to financial products to address both climate investment risk and climate risk. Germany has committed an initial €28 million to ACliFF, which will initiate operations in 2018.
Going forward, development finance institutions will be expected to deliver more climate finance and related support to countries, and to make all their activities compatible with efforts to address climate change. ADB has an opportunity to play an even more significant role in helping our developing member countries fulfill their climate pledges.

NEW DELHI: The Climate Group and Clean Energy Access Network will host the third India Energy Access Summit from February 12-13, 2018, catalyzing leaders and innovators from India and beyond to accelerate clean power for all.
The Summit, now in its third year, will bring together policymakers, investors and businesses in the decentralized renewable energy (DRE) space to identify opportunities, challenges and successes in India’s fast-changing energy landscape.
Through high-level panel discussion, TED-style talks and thematic workshops, attendees will explore how scaling up decentralized renewable energy will simultaneously accelerate India’s energy transition as well as support the country’s commitments to deliver India’s Nationally Determined Contributions on climate and UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
Panel discussions will be split across two days and will range from sessions about India’s leadership on 100% electrification by 2022, the role of the private sector, and big data analytics for energy access, to enabling India’s mainstream financing for scaling up DRE. A draft agenda is available on the event page.
In India, it is estimated that more than 230 million people do not have access to electricity, so rely on dangerous, fossil-fuel based energy sources such as kerosene lamps. Without access to modern electricity, income generation and other socio-economic benefits are limited.
While the government aims to provide electricity to all households by 2022, DRE plays a vital role in meeting the reliable, affordable power requirements of these under-served communities more urgently.
Jarnail Singh, India Director, The Climate Group, says: ""The third India Energy Access Summit will explore the new role of decentralized renewable energy as well as the business community in accelerating clean power for all – the mission that underpins India’s superlative performance towards achieving its SDGs.
“The 2018 Summit will also capitalize on the unprecedented political will that is currently being exhibited by the Government of India to electrify all households by 2022. We look forward to leaders and innovators from India and beyond joining us to drive universal energy access.""

The Alinker is a revolution in walk assists. It is a three wheeled self-propelled walking bike, designed for the user experience. The Alinker is a non-motorized walking-bike without pedals. The Alinker is for people who want to maintain an active life regardless of mobility challenges. The Alinker is challenging assumptions about people with disabilities and is building an inclusive community.
The Alinker company is a certified B Corporation and SHEEO venture, measuring social and environmental impact through the UN SDG’s. The Alinker creates access to mobility, community and healthy food through the vision of changing the paradigm of our current 'sickcare' system towards a healthcare community that actually supports the wellness of people.
We offer three different options to own your Alinker
The Alinker is a non-motorized walking-bike without pedals. With an adjustable saddle and handlebars, it is custom designed to challenge society’s assumptions about disability.
Most medical devices are a technical solution for a body with a problem, it emphasizes the ""problem"". But, we are humans, and we have a body. The body does not determine who we are.
So the Alinker is designed for how we want to live, regardless of mobility challenges. Learn More
Other than the physical state, having a mindset dedicated to health and wellness has proven to be a crucial factor for successfully using the Alinker. Based on our experience, we can generally say that you need to be at least able to do the following:
Be prepared to spend some time to get used to the new way of moving, it addresses muscle groups you might not have used for a while, and building your condition is to be done gradually. Showing commitment to maintaining healthy practice and knowing that it will be worth the effort - this is what investing in your wellness can look like. Learn More
When measuring your inseam, measure lightly.
When the measurement is on the cusp, choose the smaller size.
If you're still unsure, contact us before deciding on size!
|Size||Inseam Measurement|
|Small||27 - 31.5 inches (68-80cm)|
|Medium||32 - 36 inches (81-91cm)|

There is no reason not to plant trees. So far the Alinker has planted over 35,000 trees.
We can grow the Alinker forest together, add your trees to the forest here.
We understand that many people who could use the Alinker have lost income and gained medical expenses, our current reactive sickcare system drives people into poverty, we get that. And... the Alinker is a high quality custom designed bike, hand assembled with nearly all custom-made parts, and that has a price.
The Alinker is not a medical device and health insurances typically do not cover things that support wellness, so in order to help bridge the gap, we offer special ways to make the Alinker more accessible. We know building a new system takes time, but we continue to develop ways to make the Alinker accessible for everybody regardless of income. It requires a paradigm shift, to build a healthcare system that actually supports wellness.

Since the Alinker, my quality of life has shifted - now I never really think about my diagnosis.
""As a social person, being constraint in my ability to go out, be in one place, not moving, not being out there having fun… it was challenging. With the Alinker, my life has become more busy - I want to keep doing more. The Alinker makes me want to get out there - it gives me the security and confidence to be able to go out into the world by myself.""

I feel secure when riding the Alinker.
""Being physically restraint created for me mental issues, often just anthill size, but if you have them in front of you everyday, it grows all by itself. Before the Alinker, I was in a grey time… I had pretty much given up on moving like a normal human being again. Now, I can go for a walk, go out with the dog again, get out in the neighbourhood - some people I hadn’t seen in 3 years.
The Alinker has made that possible.""
Chris K, active Alinker user Learn More
Since I’ve had the Alinker, my autonomous world is bigger.
""I know that I can do more things on my own, then I feel I have more agency over myself. I can be independent moving around spaces like leaving my house, airports, train stations, even museums… I am not relying on someone else to move me around anymore. But now that I have the Alinker, I can walk, talk, and laugh at the same time. I feel safe, I feel better about myself, and I feel more confident.""

Abstract
Background: Pollution - unwanted waste released to air, water, and land by human activity - is the largest environmental cause of disease in the world today. It is responsible for an estimated nine million premature deaths per year, enormous economic losses, erosion of human capital, and degradation of ecosystems. Ocean pollution is an important, but insufficiently recognized and inadequately controlled component of global pollution. It poses serious threats to human health and well-being. The nature and magnitude of these impacts are only beginning to be understood.
Goals: (1) Broadly examine the known and potential impacts of ocean pollution on human health. (2) Inform policy makers, government leaders, international organizations, civil society, and the global public of these threats. (3) Propose priorities for interventions to control and prevent pollution of the seas and safeguard human health.
Methods: Topic-focused reviews that examine the effects of ocean pollution on human health, identify gaps in knowledge, project future trends, and offer evidence-based guidance for effective intervention.
Environmental findings: Pollution of the oceans is widespread, worsening, and in most countries poorly controlled. It is a complex mixture of toxic metals, plastics, manufactured chemicals, petroleum, urban and industrial wastes, pesticides, fertilizers, pharmaceutical chemicals, agricultural runoff, and sewage. More than 80% arises from land-based sources. It reaches the oceans through rivers, runoff, atmospheric deposition and direct discharges. It is often heaviest near the coasts and most highly concentrated along the coasts of low- and middle-income countries. Plastic is a rapidly increasing and highly visible component of ocean pollution, and an estimated 10 million metric tons of plastic waste enter the seas each year. Mercury is the metal pollutant of greatest concern in the oceans; it is released from two main sources - coal combustion and small-scale gold mining. Global spread of industrialized agriculture with increasing use of chemical fertilizer leads to extension of Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs) to previously unaffected regions. Chemical pollutants are ubiquitous and contaminate seas and marine organisms from the high Arctic to the abyssal depths.
Ecosystem findings: Ocean pollution has multiple negative impacts on marine ecosystems, and these impacts are exacerbated by global climate change. Petroleum-based pollutants reduce photosynthesis in marine microorganisms that generate oxygen. Increasing absorption of carbon dioxide into the seas causes ocean acidification, which destroys coral reefs, impairs shellfish development, dissolves calcium-containing microorganisms at the base of the marine food web, and increases the toxicity of some pollutants. Plastic pollution threatens marine mammals, fish, and seabirds and accumulates in large mid-ocean gyres. It breaks down into microplastic and nanoplastic particles containing multiple manufactured chemicals that can enter the tissues of marine organisms, including species consumed by humans. Industrial releases, runoff, and sewage increase frequency and severity of HABs, bacterial pollution, and anti-microbial resistance. Pollution and sea surface warming are triggering poleward migration of dangerous pathogens such as the Vibrio species. Industrial discharges, pharmaceutical wastes, pesticides, and sewage contribute to global declines in fish stocks.
Human health findings: Methylmercury and PCBs are the ocean pollutants whose human health effects are best understood. Exposures of infants in utero to these pollutants through maternal consumption of contaminated seafood can damage developing brains, reduce IQ and increase children's risks for autism, ADHD and learning disorders. Adult exposures to methylmercury increase risks for cardiovascular disease and dementia. Manufactured chemicals - phthalates, bisphenol A, flame retardants, and perfluorinated chemicals, many of them released into the seas from plastic waste - can disrupt endocrine signaling, reduce male fertility, damage the nervous system, and increase risk of cancer. HABs produce potent toxins that accumulate in fish and shellfish. When ingested, these toxins can cause severe neurological impairment and rapid death. HAB toxins can also become airborne and cause respiratory disease. Pathogenic marine bacteria cause gastrointestinal diseases and deep wound infections. With climate change and increasing pollution, risk is high that Vibrio infections, including cholera, will increase in frequency and extend to new areas. All of the health impacts of ocean pollution fall disproportionately on vulnerable populations in the Global South - environmental injustice on a planetary scale.
Conclusions: Ocean pollution is a global problem. It arises from multiple sources and crosses national boundaries. It is the consequence of reckless, shortsighted, and unsustainable exploitation of the earth's resources. It endangers marine ecosystems. It impedes the production of atmospheric oxygen. Its threats to human health are great and growing, but still incompletely understood. Its economic costs are only beginning to be counted.Ocean pollution can be prevented. Like all forms of pollution, ocean pollution can be controlled by deploying data-driven strategies based on law, policy, technology, and enforcement that target priority pollution sources. Many countries have used these tools to control air and water pollution and are now applying them to ocean pollution. Successes achieved to date demonstrate that broader control is feasible. Heavily polluted harbors have been cleaned, estuaries rejuvenated, and coral reefs restored.Prevention of ocean pollution creates many benefits. It boosts economies, increases tourism, helps restore fisheries, and improves human health and well-being. It advances the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). These benefits will last for centuries.
Recommendations: World leaders who recognize the gravity of ocean pollution, acknowledge its growing dangers, engage civil society and the global public, and take bold, evidence-based action to stop pollution at source will be critical to preventing ocean pollution and safeguarding human health.Prevention of pollution from land-based sources is key. Eliminating coal combustion and banning all uses of mercury will reduce mercury pollution. Bans on single-use plastic and better management of plastic waste reduce plastic pollution. Bans on persistent organic pollutants (POPs) have reduced pollution by PCBs and DDT. Control of industrial discharges, treatment of sewage, and reduced applications of fertilizers have mitigated coastal pollution and are reducing frequency of HABs. National, regional and international marine pollution control programs that are adequately funded and backed by strong enforcement have been shown to be effective. Robust monitoring is essential to track progress.Further interventions that hold great promise include wide-scale transition to renewable fuels; transition to a circular economy that creates little waste and focuses on equity rather than on endless growth; embracing the principles of green chemistry; and building scientific capacity in all countries.Designation of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) will safeguard critical ecosystems, protect vulnerable fish stocks, and enhance human health and well-being. Creation of MPAs is an important manifestation of national and international commitment to protecting the health of the seas.

Minister for Foreign Affairs Jeppe Kofod will tomorrow launch a new national strategy for attracting foreign investments to Denmark. The strategy focuses particularly on attracting technology and knowledge-based, green investments across all of Denmark. The strategy is the first national strategy for attracting foreign investments and runs from 2020-2023.
Minister for Foreign Affairs Jeppe Kofod states:
“The new strategy is an important part of my green foreign policy. A foreign policy that contributes to Danish welfare and jobs across Denmark. We will work to attract investments and solutions that contribute to reaching our climate goals. By attracting green investments to Denmark, we ensure that the green solutions of the future are developed and applied here and then exported globally. Denmark must be a green super power that acts on the global climate crisis and contributes to sustainable solutions worldwide.”
The strategy is launched on Bornholm where Jeppe Kofod is visiting the ACDC-project - a collaboration between Nissan, Vestas, DTU, Circle Consult and Bornholm’s Energy & Utilities.
The project aims to develop new technology for charging stations that helps effectively to control the charging of electric vehicles. Simultaneously, the project supports a smart integration of electrical vehicles that can displace CO2 in the transport sector and ensure that electrical vehicles can contribute to the increased use of sustainable energy.
Minister for Foreign Affairs Jeppe Kofod states:
“The ACDC-project is a good example of what we aim to achieve with this new strategy. It has the potential to increase productivity and innovation in Danish business and support and accelerate the green transition, and it promotes growth and development across Denmark. The project also shows that successful attraction of foreign investments rests on a close collaboration between Invest in Denmark and municipalities as well as knowledge institutions and other local actors.”
The ACDC-project has been attracted to Bornholm in a collaboration between Invest in Denmark, Copenhagen Capacity, Bornholm’s Municipality and Bornholm’s Energy & Utilities. Moreover, the project has received EUDP funding via the Danish Energy Agency.
Fact: The national effort for attracting foreign investments is anchored in Invest in Denmark, which is part of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Invest in Denmark attracts knowledge, technology, capital, and jobs to Denmark in collaboration with public and private partners such as Copenhagen Capacity, Danish municipalities, universities etc. This has created great value and led to the creation of more than 15,000 jobs in Denmark throughout the previous 10 years.
For additional press:
Press Advisor Kristian Frey Jensen, 41532639 . Denmark and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs are warm advocates of a more sustainable world, and we work to promote the sustainability agenda in both national and international contexts.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has launched our own sustainability strategy, which aspires to create a more sustainable workplace and thereby contribute to the achievement of the 2030-agenda including the Global Goals and the Paris Agreement. By launching a sustainability strategy, we want to “walk the talk on the global goals” and ensure alignment between our internal procedures and external messages and actions.
It is our vision to become one of the world’s five most sustainable foreign services within the next five years. Thereby we wish to maintain high credibility among staff and partners and remain a relevant organisation as the world moves towards a more sustainable future.
The sustainability initiative will be implemented within three separate pillars - each pillar having its own concrete ambition:
- Significantly reduce the carbon footprint of the Danish Foreign Service
- Sustainability guides all of our everyday choices
- The Danish Foreign Service is the best public workplace in Denmark
Within each pillar, there are several concrete initiatives on how we can make progress and achieve our ambitions. Some initiatives are implementable across the entire ministry, while others are primarily relevant in the home service or at the diplomatic missions abroad.
There is a lot of work ahead of us and we still face many unanswered questions. Therefore, the first phase of the initiative focuses among other things on defining ‘baselines’ - how sustainable are we today, where can we improve, and how can we acquire more sustainable habits?
Many concrete initiatives have already been implemented. In recent years, we have managed to reduce the energy consumption of the ministry at Asiatisk Plads in Copenhagen by around 40%, inter alia, because we have switched to low-energy consuming LED light bulbs, installed new heat pumps and replaced parts of our ventilation system. In addition, our conference center Eigtved’s Pakhus has received the sustainability stamp ‘Green Key certification’. At the embassy in Ghana, solar cells and new air conditioning have been installed reducing the energy consumption by 46% in only one year. Furthermore, at the embassy in Estonia we have made a complete shift away from using disposable plastic. These and other kinds of initiatives will be continued and expanded within the Foreign Service in the coming months and years. .

These disasters have also disproportionately harmed low-income people and their access to food, which is why we have chosen to focus on the connection between climate change and food security in the 2019 Global Hunger Index (GHI), prepared by Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe. Sadly, this is not a trend that appears to be going away any time soon. Looking ahead, climate models predict higher average temperatures in most land and ocean regions, hotter extremes in many inhabited regions, and both heavy precipitation and an increasing probability of drought in some areas. These are all additional challenges for reducing hunger.
Since 2000, we’ve reduced global hunger on a proportionate level. But in absolute terms, the number of people going to bed hungry is on the rise.
While the world has made gradual progress in reducing hunger on a global scale since 2000, this progress has been uneven. We’ve reduced global hunger, but in absolute terms, the number of people going to bed hungry is on the rise. The GHI takes into account the rates of undernourishment, child stunting, child wasting, and child mortality to highlight where action is most needed to fight hunger. With 2019’s data now available (along with an updated ranking of the world’s hungriest countries), let’s take a look at some of the ways climate change threatens food security — and how that may impact all of us.
Climate change and food security: Fast facts
- Climate change is a threat multiplier for hungry and undernourished people.
- Countries with high levels of hunger are often also highly vulnerable to climate change, and have a low capacity to adapt.
- Climate change affects food production and availability, access, quality, utilization, and stability of food systems. In short, it impacts all aspects of the food system.
- Extreme weather-related disasters are increasing and reduce the yields of major crops.
- Higher levels of CO2 reduce the nutritional value of crops.
- The global food system contributes about one-third of greenhouse gas emissions. About ⅔ of food are lost and wasted from farm to table. These losses therefore exacerbate climate change without improving food security or nutrition.
- Climate change and conflict combined destroy livelihoods, drive displacement, widen inequalities, and undermine sustainable development.
- Ending hunger and undernutrition in a changing climate demands large-scale action.
What's your carbon footprint?
The communities least responsible for climate change are struggling the most because of it. See how your day-to-day emissions stack up, and learn more about the impacts of climate change on people living in extreme poverty around the world.
Climate change threatens agriculture and food production
Higher temperatures, water scarcity, extreme events like droughts and floods, and greater CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere have already begun to impact staple crops around the world. Maize and wheat production has declined in recent years due to extreme weather events, plant diseases, and an overall increase in water scarcity.
According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the unpredictable yield for cereal crops in semi-arid regions of the world (like the Sahel region of Africa) is at least 80% the result of climate variability.
The World's 10 Hungriest Countries
Despite global hunger levels falling, one in nine people worldwide still face hunger. Here are the 10 hungriest countries according to the 2019 Global Hunger Index.
In other areas like Bangladesh and Vietnam, rising sea levels pose a different threat to food security. As the saltwater is more likely to flood coastal farmlands, it is also more likely to kill off rice crops. Half of Vietnam’s national rice production is centered on the Mekong Delta region, which means that a flood in this region (roughly the size of Maryland) could impact both the country’s food security and economy.
While the causes of these issues are fairly consistent (and often not the doing of the people living in these regions), the solutions are not. This means that, with the effects of climate change already apparent in areas like the Horn of Africa and Southeast Asia, we need to find unique methods to mitigate disasters when they strike, and develop bespoke ways to reduce the impacts of hazards on the lives and livelihoods of these areas in the future.
Climate change limits food access
If climate change affects food production, it stands to reason that it also affects food access. This simple supply-and-demand has big impacts: Climate change and weather disasters (such as floods or drought) can lead to inflated prices for the food that is available. These price spikes leave the poorest households (urban poor and rural food-buyers) most vulnerable, with the urban poor spending up to 75% of their total budget on food alone.
Because our food systems are increasingly dependent on one another, this means that more frequent and more extreme events in one region could disrupt clusters of food systems — even the global food system as a whole. The areas least likely to adjust to a sudden event or shock, however, continue to be the ones disproportionately affected.
Climate change decreases nutrition and nutritional value
In many food-insecure areas, the next concern becomes nutrition. In low-income and agrarian communities, the patterns of food consumption are seasonal. A pre-harvest “lean season” will leave families reducing their food consumption (often skipping one or more meals each day) until the next harvest. With climate change reducing harvests, this means that the lean period may be extended if there are fewer supplies, or if it takes longer to get an adequate harvest.
By 2050, an estimated additional 175 million people could have zinc deficiencies, and an additional 122 million people could be protein deficient — due to climate change.
Alternatively, climate change can adversely affect the nutritional value of food that is grown. Studies show that higher carbon dioxide concentrations reduce the protein, zinc, and iron content of crops. By 2050, an estimated additional 175 million people could have zinc deficiencies (which can, among other things, make them more susceptible to illnesses) and an additional 122 million people could be protein deficient. Communities relying largely on plant harvests for their nutrition will, again, feel this most acutely.
Beyond plant-based nutrition, this also has a ripple effect on livestock, who rely on the same resources as humans to eat, grow, and produce meat and/or milk. Livestock are also severely threatened by drought, accounting for 36% of drought-related losses (crops account for 49%). Climate extremes also threaten fish populations, especially in areas like Southeast Asia.
Climate change increases food waste
Rain doesn’t guarantee healthy crops, either. Higher rainfalls or flooding can produce toxic mold on crops. Crops grown in high-drought areas that are then moved into humid storage facilities are vulnerable to fungal infections or pests. The more climate changes and the more that extreme climate events become commonplace, the more food we lose on an annual basis.
According to the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization, roughly one-third of the food produced by farmers is lost between the field and the market in low- and middle-income countries. In high-income countries, a similar amount is wasted between the market and the table. Currently, the food system contributes 21–37% of greenhouse gases, meaning that these food losses add to the climate crisis but do nothing for food security or malnutrition levels.
Conclusion
Climate change affects the global food system in such a way that those who already suffer from hunger and undernutrition are those most vulnerable to these added threats. In order to end hunger — one of the UN’s top Sustainable Development Goals for the year 2030 — we therefore need to also tackle the current climate crisis, particularly the topic of climate justice and the inequities that are raised by climate change.
Climate justice and the 5 inequities of climate change, explained
Learn why developed countries must provide support for the developing countries most affected by climate change.
As we can see with the increasingly global nature of our food system, however, this cannot happen in isolation. We must foster global solidarity with the most climate-vulnerable communities and countries, with high-income countries (especially those with the highest greenhouse emissions) taking responsibility for both mitigating the causes of climate change and supporting low- and middle-income countries in adapting to the effects of these changes. All of this is a tall order, but it’s an order that will affect all of our futures, regardless of where we live.

Imagining a sustainable ocean economy
The Economist Group’s World Ocean Initiative imagines an ocean in robust health, and with a vital economy. Year-round and at our flagship World Ocean Summit, we foster a global conversation on the greatest challenges facing the seas, inspiring bold thinking, new partnerships and the most effective action to build a sustainable ocean economy.
The Initiative concentrates on three cross-cutting levers of change — finance, governance and innovation — each of which concern the ‘what’ and the ‘why’ for a sustainable ocean, but most of all they explore the ‘how’.

Imagining a sustainable ocean economy
The Economist Group’s World Ocean Initiative imagines an ocean in robust health, and with a vital economy. Year-round and at our flagship World Ocean Summit, we foster a global conversation on the greatest challenges facing the seas, inspiring bold thinking, new partnerships and the most effective action to build a sustainable ocean economy.
The Initiative concentrates on three cross-cutting levers of change — finance, governance and innovation — each of which concern the ‘what’ and the ‘why’ for a sustainable ocean, but most of all they explore the ‘how’.

Actionable insights, practical solutions
Limiting global warming to 1.5°C will require unparalleled transformations to businesses, industries and supply chains. Investors and citizens demand action. Firms are responding: more and more are signing on to bold targets grounded in climate science. But while sustainability is far from languishing on the corporate periphery, far more effort is needed―and fast.
Over four days, The Economist’s sixth annual Sustainability Week will provide actionable insights and solutions to help businesses on their path to greater sustainability. We will explore how firms can effectively measure, analyse, transform and scale their sustainability initiatives. How can sufficient investment be unlocked? How can good data be generated? What incentives are needed to stimulate innovation?

Tony Blair
Executive chairman, Tony Blair Institute for Global Change and former Prime Minister, Great Britain and Northern Ireland
Tony Blair served as Prime Minister of Great Britain and Northern Ireland from 1997 to 2007 – the only Labour leader in the party’s 100-year history to win three consecutive elections.
During his time in Downing Street Tony Blair implemented a major domestic reform agenda. Through record investment and reform, the UK’s education and healthcare sectors were transformed. The New Labour Government led by Tony implemented the largest hospital and school building since the creation of the UK’s welfare state.
Overall crime was reduced by a third, and the first ever national minimum wage was introduced. There was also transformational progress on human rights and equality and all of this took place during a period of record economic growth and levels of employment.
As Prime Minister, Tony Blair was also a central figure on the global stage. He helped bring peace to Northern Ireland, securing the historic Good Friday Agreement in 1998. He was a passionate advocate of an interventionist foreign policy. Tony created the Department for International Development, tripled the UK’s foreign aid to Africa, and introduced landmark legislation to tackle climate change.
Since leaving office Tony Blair has spent most of his time working on three areas: supporting governments to deliver effectively for their people, working for peace in the Middle East, and countering extremism. He established the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change to work on some of the most difficult challenges in the world today, believing that real leadership has never been more necessary or more difficult.
Currently, teams from Mr. Blair’s Institute are directly supporting leaders across the globe in their fight against Covid-19, delivering analysis and advice to help countries mitigate the economic impact, to harness the power of technology and to better position themselves for the rebuilding to come.

Protecting the environment is a global priority and it is as urgent in the Middle East and North Africa region as it is anywhere else in the world. Dramatic economic growth has at times been detrimental to the fragile natural environment. There is a rising call for a change in mindset, advancing the notion that the economy and the environment go hand in hand.
This event will convene business leaders, policymakers, scientists, academics, and investors, to offer them concrete strategies and ideas to help them to prepare for the future, and scale up their efforts towards ensuring sustainability. How can regional policymakers apply lessons learnt across the globe to their country’s sustainability plans? What must business leaders do to scale up action from responsibility to leadership? What role does the financial industry have to play in encouraging green investment? What research is needed to stimulate eco-innovation, and how can scientific evidence and models facilitate better decision making? We will be discussing these topics and many more during the forum.
Why attend
Join 350+ industry leaders and policymakers who are at the forefront of the sustainability agenda across the world. Have your say discussing the challenges and opportunities in the global effort to protect the environment, ensuring that business has a part in it too.
Join us and you will;
- Network with business leaders, policymakers, scientists, academics, and investors
- Share strategies and ideas on how to become more sustainable
- Review international policies and how they can be implemented within the region
- Discuss the role of the finance industry in encouraging the adoption of climate finance and of environmental impact investing

Setting the scene: Operating within the ‘planetary playing field’
First introduced in 2009 by a group of renowned scientists, the planetary boundaries framework identifies and quantifies nine boundaries under which humanity can develop sustainably. This framework has since gone on to underpin much of the world’s present thinking, including the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This scene-setting session will explore and explain the current thinking on sustainability. What does this mean for policymakers and industry? What would a path towards a more resilient future look like?

Panel: Encoding sustainability into capital markets
Can the financial industry become a driver of green growth? For sustainable enterprises to thrive, investors must support them. Capital is increasingly being used as a tool for sustainable development and not solely for short-term gains. Environmental, social and governance (ESG) policies are no longer just nice to have, but are actually starting to reshape the goals and fiduciary duties of investment professionals. Yet sustainable investment options are still limited, so how can financial backers collaborate with governments and international associations to improve financial flows to environmental innovators and adopters.

The future of the blue economy
“If anything ought to be too big to fail, it is the ocean”, The Economist reminds us. Yet ill-defined opportunities and a lack of policy are commonplace. How can more urgency be injected into the “blue economy”? How can policymakers link the ocean to global climate actions? And how can technological developments revolutionise how governments, scientists and businesses engage with the ocean?

Actionable insights, practical solutions
Limiting global warming to 1.5°C will require unparalleled transformations to businesses, industries and supply chains. Investors and citizens demand action. Firms are responding: more and more are signing on to bold targets grounded in climate science. But while sustainability is far from languishing on the corporate periphery, far more effort is needed―and fast.
Over four days, The Economist’s sixth annual Sustainability Week will provide actionable insights and solutions to help businesses on their path to greater sustainability. We will explore how firms can effectively measure, analyse, transform and scale their sustainability initiatives. How can sufficient investment be unlocked? How can good data be generated? What incentives are needed to stimulate innovation?

Tony Blair
Executive chairman, Tony Blair Institute for Global Change and former Prime Minister, Great Britain and Northern Ireland
Tony Blair served as Prime Minister of Great Britain and Northern Ireland from 1997 to 2007 – the only Labour leader in the party’s 100-year history to win three consecutive elections.
During his time in Downing Street Tony Blair implemented a major domestic reform agenda. Through record investment and reform, the UK’s education and healthcare sectors were transformed. The New Labour Government led by Tony implemented the largest hospital and school building since the creation of the UK’s welfare state.
Overall crime was reduced by a third, and the first ever national minimum wage was introduced. There was also transformational progress on human rights and equality and all of this took place during a period of record economic growth and levels of employment.
As Prime Minister, Tony Blair was also a central figure on the global stage. He helped bring peace to Northern Ireland, securing the historic Good Friday Agreement in 1998. He was a passionate advocate of an interventionist foreign policy. Tony created the Department for International Development, tripled the UK’s foreign aid to Africa, and introduced landmark legislation to tackle climate change.
Since leaving office Tony Blair has spent most of his time working on three areas: supporting governments to deliver effectively for their people, working for peace in the Middle East, and countering extremism. He established the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change to work on some of the most difficult challenges in the world today, believing that real leadership has never been more necessary or more difficult.
Currently, teams from Mr. Blair’s Institute are directly supporting leaders across the globe in their fight against Covid-19, delivering analysis and advice to help countries mitigate the economic impact, to harness the power of technology and to better position themselves for the rebuilding to come.

socialincome,https://socialincome.org/ ,"Universal Basic Income
Universal Basic Income (UBI) is a government-guaranteed payment program for people in need. Its intention is to provide enough money to cover basic living expenses and improve recipients' financial security.
Like the UBI, the idea of Social Income is based on regular payments in the sense of securing the minimum subsistence needs. While the unconditional basic income is financed by the state, social income sees itself as a solidarity initiative among people.

Dr. Bernice King and Michael Tubbs for Times
Direct Cash Transfers
Direct Cash Transfers are payments made to eligible groups of people in need, often by governments or NGOs. They can be provided either conditionally or unconditionally. Cash transfers allow recipients to obtain a range of goods and services of their choice directly from local markets and service providers.
Social Income's direct cash payments are not dependent on political decisions, government budgets or taxes. The primary goal of Social Income is the voluntary and direct redistribution of wealth between private individuals.

Mobile Banking
Mobile banking is a service provided by a bank, mobile provider or other financial institution that allows its customers to conduct financial transactions remotely using a mobile device such as a phone or tablet. Africa is leading the way in mainstream adoption of mobile banking.
Social Income is aimed at people who live in poverty and whose access to financial services can be guaranteed via mobile phone.

Reducing inequalities and ensuring no one is left behind are integral to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.

Slavery and trafficking still exist today.
There are more children, women and men trapped in slavery than ever before in human history. People are beaten, raped and starved for the profit of others around the world.
We can end slavery in our lifetime.
Slavery is a multibillion-dollar industry. It exists because oppressors can freely abuse vulnerable people without fear of punishment. We partner with local law enforcement and justice systems to end it—for good.
Every person deserves to be free from violence.
Give children, women and men the safety and freedom they deserve. You can make an impact in the fight to end slavery. Join us in this fight - until all are free.
Who we are
We are a global organization partnering with local justice systems to end violence against people living in poverty. We need you with us. Here's our model:
Rescue and Restore Victims
We find enslaved people, bring them to safety and walk alongside them until they are restored.
Bring Criminals to Justice
We relentlessly pursue justice in court. We ensure that traffickers, rapists and other criminals go to jail so they cannot abuse, exploit or enslave others.
Strengthen Justice Systems
We provide training, mentoring and support to police, judges and other community leaders to slow down and stop the cycle of violence.

NASA's goal in Earth science is to observe, understand, and model the Earth system to discover how it is changing, to better predict change, and to understand the consequences for life on Earth. The Applied Sciences Program, within the Science Mission Directorate (which replaced both the Office of Earth Science and the Office of Space Science), serves NASA and Society by expanding and accelerating the realization of societal and economic benefits from Earth science, information, and technology research and development.
The Prediction Of Worldwide Energy Resources (POWER) project was initiated to improve upon the current renewable energy data set and to create new data sets from new satellite systems. The POWER project targets three user communities: (1) Renewable Energy, (2) Sustainable Buildings, and (3) Agroclimatology.
Dr. Stackhouse is a Senior Research Scientist at the NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia. At NASA Langley Research Center, he is lead scientist of the NASA/Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment (GEWEX) Surface Radiation Budget (SRB) Project, a project responsible to use satellite and other analysis to estimate the long-term surface radiation budget and components. He is a science team member of the Clouds and Earth Radiant Energy System (CERES) project and co-leads the FLASHFlux (Fast Longwave and Shortwave radiative Fluxes) working group that produces low latency estimates of top-of-atmosphere and surface radiation data products from CERES.
Using the long-term and near-real time data products from the science projects above, Dr. Stackhouse leads several NASA-funded Applied Science projects that customize, these data products along with meteorological input, for the energy-related and agricultural industries. These applied science projects are organized under the POWER theme and have led to the development of data sets and web interface tools for the solar energy and agricultural industries over the last 15 years. The web sites including the original Surface meteorology and Solar Energy (SSE) has shown continued growth of the last few years eclipsing 20 million separate data requests. The POWER web site additionally serves low latency time series data sets with large outreach through connections to decision support tools and specialized data formats. Dr. Stackhouse completed his M.S. and Ph.D. in Atmospheric Sciences at Colorado State University in 1989 and 1995 respectively.
A. Jason Barnett is a geospatial and technology developer for the POWER project team. He has a Masters of Agriculture from Iowa State University and was awarded a Bachelor of Science in Geography with an emphasis in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) from Old Dominion University along with a GIS certificate. He leads web, python, cloud computing and data web services development support and assists with project management.

Growing together towards a PUre future
Sustainable innovation is the driver behind all our research and development efforts. It is at the heart of our strategy and a key deciding factor in everything we do. Every day, we renew our commitment to finding responsible solutions to the various challenges and needs of our customers and the planet.
We constantly aim to increase our positive impact on society and the environment. We are proud of the fact that the CO2 emissions avoided by our insulation solutions offset more than 40 times the carbon footprint of the activities of all our business lines combined.
We believe that future growth will come from our capability to respond perfectly to more complex societal needs. That means finding innovative solutions for the major challenges in society today, such as global warming, conservation of natural resources and ageing populations. . Sustainability & Innovation
Sustainable innovation programmes
With the goal of leading the transition to a circular economy and a low-carbon society and promoting well-being at every age, our Sustainable Innovation Department’s R&D efforts are centred around four innovation programmes, each led by an Innovation Manager.
Developed through permanent collaboration between product development teams and SID innovation teams, three of the programmes are aligned with the specific market expectations from our divisions. They will bring more sustainable solutions to our Engineered Foams, Insulation and Bedding customers such as new comfort foam for bedding or seating applications, or finding solutions to fulfil the requirements for technical foams in the field of silencing.
The corporate programme covers projects impacting all three divisions and coordinates all initiatives to prepare durable polyurethane products for the circular economy. This spans the entire product value chain, from raw materials to polyurethane recycling and reuse.
These four programmes underpin our sustainability strategy, differentiate Recticel from its competitors and generate shared value for all stakeholders.
The Fit² programme seeks to gain a deeper scientific understanding of comfort for seating and sleeping systems. The new knowledge is reflected in the Sleep Triangle as the guideline for the development of new, more durable and sustainable materials and systems.
As a first result, a new generation of Geltex® foams for mattresses was launched at the Cologne IMM trade fair in January 2018. These foams offer excellent support, ideal pressure distribution and good climate control. Additionally, they contain CO2-based raw materials, partially replacing traditional fossil fuel-based raw materials. At the same time, the new Geltex® foam family is more resistant to humidity, temperature changes and mechanical stress, offering a longer lifetime at the same level of comfort.
In January 2020, we introduced 100% recyclable Geltex® mattresses with covers from recycled materials at the Cologne IMM trade fair. This year will see the launch of a range of new developments that underline our vision of sustainable sleep comfort.
The Silencing programme concentrates on the development of differentiated and innovative acoustic solutions for automotive and industry markets. The aim of our research is to reduce noise impacts contributing to more comfortable and productive environments.
We established a centre of competence for acoustics with state-of-the-art equipment, methods and tools for the characterisation of the acoustic performance of materials and solutions.
In 2019, we further extended our acoustic lab capabilities from small-scale and pilot-scale testing of materials and solutions towards real-life testing of complete systems in their applications. We have developed an in-depth expertise to better understand the fundamentals of acoustics: sound, its propagation and the different ways of minimising its impact on the environment.
Advanced multilayered complexes are under development for use in automotive applications, including electric vehicles, and also in low noise industrial equipment applications, such as compressors and gensets. It demonstrates our ambition to be the global preferred supplier of silencing solutions for these industries.
Sustainability has always been core for the thermal insulation business. Our thermal insulation solutions for building renovations and new constructions contribute to a low-carbon society: CO2 emissions avoided by our insulation solutions add up to more than 40 times the carbon footprint of the activities of our four business lines combined.
The Low Lambda programme concentrates on developing new rigid foams with better insulation values. Improving the insulation value of a product has an immense, positive effect on natural resource consumption. Xentro® features a 13% lambda value reduction, achieving the lowest lambda value ever for rigid polyurethane panels. Research is ongoing to push the boundaries of insulation properties even further.
Innovative combinations
Comfofix® combines a thermal insulation panel with a recycled, flexible foam, acoustic layer, enabling an easy-to-install pitched roof insulation product. Du.Panel® X, an advanced thermal insulation panel for the agricultural sector, combines a high insulation value with enhanced fire resistance properties.
In 2019, we developed Lumix®, a new type of thermal insulation board for pitched roofs on agricultural buildings. The Lumix® sheets are covered with a unique dark layer that absorbs rather than reflects light, thus providing more comfort for domestic fowl and pigs in the barn and, therefore, excellent for organic livestock farming.
This programme steers all initiatives that aim to prepare durable polyurethane products for the circular economy. This covers the whole value chain of our products, from raw materials to the recycling and reuse of polyurethane. Partnerships with all actors in the value chain are essential to a successful transition. A variety of large projects are currently running, in collaboration with different consortia as enablers, that aim to realise our sustainability goals.
Two projects focussing on developing recycling options for polyurethanes are underway:
PUReSmart
Recticel coordinates the PUReSmart project, launched on 1 January 2019 for a duration of four years. It is supported by EUR 6 million in funding from the European Union Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation programme. The PUReSmart collaborative consortium gathers nine partners from six different countries and seeks ways of transitioning from the current linear lifecycle of polyurethane (PU) products to a circular economy model.
Go to the PUReSmart website
This project has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation programme under grant agreement N° 814543.
Besides recycling projects, Recticel also investigates the production of polyurethane using raw materials with lower carbon footprints. Two different projects illustrate this commitment:

Sustainable business in Sweden
Extensive environmental protection, active measures to respect human rights and improve work environments, and fighting corruption. Many of today’s Swedish companies are at the forefront in integrating a sustainable approach to business in their strategies and daily management.
Leading by example
The term sustainable business is used to describe the work companies do that has a positive impact on society, the environment or the economy. Efforts to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide, promotion of equal career opportunities, and involvement with local communities are examples of sustainable business initiatives.
Swedish companies have a long history of active work in the field and is widely viewed as a pioneer. In the latest the RobecoSAM Country Sustainability Ranking (2019), Sweden was ranked first of 65 countries, based on environmental, social and governance (ESG) indicators.
Environment
The environmental aspects of sustainable business are extremely broad, including areas such as paper recycling, the sustainable use of resources, minimising environmental footprints and reducing water consumption.
Cleantech – a term used to describe products or services that improve operational performance, productivity or efficiency while reducing costs, inputs, energy consumption, waste or pollution – is another important part of sustainable business. Internationally, Sweden continues to fare well in energy and environmental technology, coming third in the Global Cleantech Innovation Index 2017, after Denmark and Finland.
Although Sweden generally fares well in international comparisons of gender equality, its construction industry remains a highly male-dominated sector.

Gender equality
Gender equality is an important aspect of the way companies work with sustainable business. Companies can promote equality by making it possible for parents to combine work and family, encouraging shared participation in childcare, and giving women and men equal opportunities to rise to leadership positions.
The World Economic Forum’s Global Gender Gap Report assesses and compares national gender gaps based on economic, political, education and health criteria. In the 2021 report, Sweden was ranked fifth of 156 assessed countries, surpassed only by Iceland, Finland, Norway and New Zealand.
Anti-corruption
Corruption has been identified by the World Bank as one of the greatest threats to growth. Sweden ranked fourth on Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index 2020, together with Finland, Singapore and Switzerland. The index ranked 180 countries and territories by their perceived levels of public sector corruption.
Since 2012, Sweden’s legislation has categorised the giving or acceptance of bribes as serious crimes. The legislation was largely a result of Sweden adopting anti-corruption conventions in collaboration with the EU, European Council, UN and OECD. Since 1997, the OECD has had a convention prohibiting the bribery of overseas public servants in international business relationships.
IKEA’s sustainability programme goes beyond taking responsibility for manufacturing plants; it also includes transportation, customer choices and parking for electric cars.

Promoting sustainable initiatives
By placing demands on its own enterprises and promoting sustainable initiatives in general, the Swedish Government aims to inspire all companies to increase their sustainability efforts.
The Swedish Government owns 46 companies of various sizes, two of which are listed companies. In 2007, Sweden became the first country to demand sustainability reports from state-owned enterprises. The reports have to comply with guidelines from the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI).
In 2012, Sweden took another important step by asking state-owned companies to set several sustainability goals, and to report on them in 2014. The targets are to be set by the company boards, with focus on diversity, environment issues, human rights, working conditions, anti-corruption measures, business ethics and gender equality. The targets must also be measurable, specific and relevant to the companies’ operations.
Human rights – a priority
The Swedish Government expects all Swedish companies, private or state-owned, to respect human rights in all their operations. It encourages the private sector to follow the OECD’s guidelines for multinational companies, to apply the ten principles of the UN Global Compact and follow the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.
In the end, however, sustainable business practice should be driven and owned by the private sector, with each company deciding if and how it will work with sustainability.
Striving to lead by example, the Government has a unit within the Ministry for Foreign Affairs focusing on issues related to sustainable trade and business, and also has an Ambassador for Sustainable Business (see box).
Environmental initiatives
Strict environmental legislation combined with high levels of environmental awareness and knowledge have led Swedish companies to be environmentally innovative and efficient in their operations. Low-impact production techniques, in particular within industrial production, are now often exported to other countries.
Sweden also plays a prominent role in cleantech sectors such as non-fossil fuels and water quality, with several companies as leaders in their fields. SEKAB, for example, is a major European supplier of ethanol and ethanol derivatives, used for fuels and low-environmental-impact chemicals, while water-technology company Xylem has operations in more than 150 countries.
Four Swedish companies striving to set examples
Atlas Copco
Atlas Copco is a leading supplier of industrial equipment such as compressors and assembly systems. Since it has operations and production facilities in countries where there is a high risk of human rights violations, Atlas Copco follows a human rights strategy. In line with this strategy the company not only conducts regular corporate assessments, but also helps business partners and customers improve human rights. www.atlascopco.com
Systembolaget
In 2012, state-owned alcohol monopoly Systembolaget introduced a code of conduct – based on the declaration of human rights made by the UN and other international bodies – for its wholesale purchases of alcoholic drinks, in collaboration with the alcohol monopolies of Norway, Finland, Iceland and the Faroe Islands. The code requires responsible treatment in terms of human rights, working conditions, anti-corruption measures, and environmental issues in both the companies’ own operations and their supply chains. www.systembolaget.se
H&M
Clothing company H&M, with nearly 5,000 stores around the world, has an eco-clothing line called Conscious Collection. H&M works actively with its suppliers to promote labour rights and reduce environmental impacts. Around 700 suppliers manufacture H&M products, many of them in countries where issues such as child labour and workplace safety can pose problems. H&M has an audit team of 70 people monitoring suppliers’ compliance with the H&M code of conduct. www.hm.com
IKEA
Furniture retailer IKEA plans to use only renewable and recycled materials in their products by 2030. The company’s extensive sustainabaility strategy can be read here.

Overview
The ArcticDEM project is a response to the need for high quality elevation data in remote locations, the availability of technology to process big data, and the need for accurate measurement of topographic change.
The producers did not intend for the final product as a single “eyes on” or edited product, but rather a collection of time-dependent elevation models and the infrastructure to process the flow of imagery from an ever-expanding constellation of satellites producing an ever-increasing volume of high-quality data.
ArcticDEM data is constructed from in-track and cross-track high-resolution (~0.5 meter) imagery acquired by the DigitalGlobe constellation of optical imaging satellites and licensed through the NGA NextView contract.
The majority of ArcticDEM data was generated from the panchromatic bands of the WorldView-1, WorldView-2, and WorldView-3 satellites. A small percentage of data was also generated from the GeoEye-1 satellite sensor.
Upon completion, ArcticDEM encompasses all land area north of 60°N. In addition, coverage includes all territory of Greenland, the State of Alaska in entirety, and the Kamchatka Peninsula of the Russian Federation.
The project began with a release of data over Alaska in September 2016 and continued to other regions on a continual basis over two years. The objective of the ArcticDEM initiative was to create a comprehensive elevation model of the Arctic within the two-year term of the U.S. Chairmanship of the Arctic Council, which began in April 2015.
ArcticDEM data is generated by applying stereo auto-correlation techniques to overlapping pairs of high-resolution optical satellite images.
Using the Surface Extraction from TIN-based Searchspace Minimization (SETSM) software, developed by M.J. Noh and Ian Howat at the Ohio State University, stereopair images are processed to Digital Elevation Models using compute resources provided by the Blue Waters supercomputer located at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
Output DEM raster files are being made available as both “strip” files as they are output directly from SETSM and preserve the original source material temporal resolution, as well as mosaic files that are compiled from multiple strips that have been co-registered, blended, and feathered to reduce edge-matching artifacts.
The time-dependent nature of the strip DEM files allows users to perform change detection analysis and to compare observations of topography data acquired in different seasons or years. The mosaic DEM tiles are assembled from multiple strip DEMs with the intention of providing a more consistent and comprehensive product over larger areas.
Current Release
Release 7
ArcticDEM Release 7 includes 185,800 new 2-meter resolution DEM strips and a re-release of the previous 75,000 strips with improved data filtering algorithms. These data cover the entire ArcticDEM domain. Production enhancements include improved filtering to preserve coastlines and better resolve densely-forested areas that are subject to seasonal variation.
The entire ArcticDEM domain was re-mosaicked with the additional DEMs in order to fill gaps from previous releases. The total mosaic includes 2,488 tiles at 2-meter resolution (distributed as 9,228 sub-tiles). Reduced-resolution versions of the mosaic are also available at 10 meters, 32 meters, 100 meters, 500 meters, and 1 kilometer for cartographic uses.

ArcticDEM Strips
Strip DEM files correspond to the overlapping area of the input stereopair image swaths as they are collected by DigitalGlobe’s constellation of polar-orbiting satellites. Strip DEM dimensions will vary according to the satellite sensor that acquired the images and the off-nadir angle of collection. Most strips are between 16 km and 18 km in width, and 110 km and 120 km in length.
Strip DEM files are provided at 2-meter spatial resolution in 32-bit GeoTIFF format. Elevation units are meters and are referenced to the WGS84 ellipsoid. Strip DEM files include metadata text files describing the xyz offsets to filtered IceSAT altimetry data, although these translations have not been applied to the DEM files. A Python script for applying these translations on the downloaded strip DEM files is hosted on the Polar Geospatial Center GitHub page, along with other useful geospatial data processing utilities.

aak,https://www.aak.com/sustainability/ceo-statement/ https://www.aak.com/sustainability/certificates/ ,"The Covid-19 pandemic brought unprecedented challenges for society and businesses in 2020. In 2021, we have a unique opportunity to build back better. For us, sustainability is a journey, not a destination. We always strive to go further, constantly taking new steps to improve and deliver solutions that are more sustainable.
Sustainability is embedded in everything we do — ensuring responsible supply chains, minimizing our environmental impact and being a knowledgeable partner on sustainable solutions for our customers.
Commitments made in 2020
We are committed to playing our part to steer our world onto a more equitable, inclusive and sustainable path.
- We have signed the UN Global Compact’s Statement for Renewed Global Cooperation, emphasizing the urgent need for global cooperation to support peace, security, human rights, and sustainable development due to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.
- We have signed the Science Based Targets initiative commitment letter. During 2021, we will set science-based targets through the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), driving the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions consistent with keeping global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.
- We have also signed the coconut industry’s first global Sustainable Charter, which aims to improve farmer livelihoods, lessen the carbon footprint of coconuts and boost supply to meet rising global demand.
A year of raised ambitions
During 2020, we took important steps to raise our ambitions and intensify our sustainability work.
- We reached out to many of our key customers with deep-dive interviews about their sustainability to identify areas where we can further improve.
- We updated and strengthened our framework for integrating sustainability into our business model – the AAK House of Sustainability. This updated model will further build commitment and mobilize action throughout our organization.
- We identified climate risks and actions that can enable us to reduce our climate impact, and we initiated the process of setting Science Based Targets.
Sustainable palm oil
In 2020, AAK has taken important steps on the journey towards sustainable palm oil:
- We adopted a sourcing plan and strategy towards a palm oil supply chain that is 100 percent traceable to plantation and 100 percent verified deforestation-free.
- We stepped up our supplier monitoring and engagement and strengthened our processes for proactively addressing non-compliance.
- We implemented the full-scale satellite monitoring of our global palm oil supply base. The new service will provide real-time insights in areas connected to our supply chain where there are risks of deforestation.
""At AAK, we recognize that our responsibilities in the value chain go far beyond our own operations and that every step is connected to multiple stakeholders around the world. We actively manage risks and opportunities and we can play an important role in the future as a catalyst for change — Making Better Happen.""
Johan Westman, President and CEO . Our products and processing methods regularly undergo audits and supervisions to safeguard that they comply with the certifications, standards, and regulations that guarantee you safe, healthy, and sustainable solutions.
Third-party certifications
We use accredited third-party organizations to verify that our production facilities operate sustainably and that every final product complies with specific standards for safety, quality, and environmental protection.
Food safety standards
Food safety is a prerequisite for producing food products. All AAK plants are certified in accordance with internationally recognized food safety standards and audited by accredited third parties. Critical Control Points (CCPs) are identified, monitored and recorded, and the food safety management system is frequently audited by local audit teams.

sbu,https://online.sbu.edu/news/2016/11/30/how-integrate-sustainability-your-business ,"How to Integrate Sustainability Into Your Business
Organizations today recognize the importance of incorporating social, environmental and governance considerations into the planning and operation of their core businesses. With plenty of opportunities arising from trends in worldwide sustainability, many companies and their leaders are adopting sustainable development plans in response to social and environmental issues that affect their business operations. In fact, consumers worldwide have become more and more likely to associate and remain loyal to a company that incorporates sustainable practices into its business.
So, just how can you successfully integrate sustainability into your business?
1. Establish a clear sustainability objective
Corporate sustainability is an achievable goal, provided that organizations plan and include their sustainability strategies within their corporate agenda. As a business, you need to consider the four primary factors necessary for developing a sustainable plan. They include: eco-efficiency programs, management infrastructure, marketing programs and strategic initiatives. You should then appoint a sustainability leader who has the right credentials, abilities and experience to lead the company’s sustainability efforts. Fortune 500 companies have created positions such as Chief Sustainability Officers or Directors to ensure their sustainability objectives are met.
2. Engage your business partners
As a business, you can do everything possible to ensure the drive of your environmental and social impacts within your operations, but you can only advance in a big way if you align with your suppliers, distributors and other members in your value chain. Effective collaboration is the key to accelerating sustainability across your industry or value chain. This collaboration is bound to help you and your industry peers, as well as environmental organizations, to reduce the negative impact of your operations and potentially innovate new processes and products toward this end.
3. Engage customers regarding the need for sustainability
You can only do so much without the support of your customers. If they are unwilling to purchase products perceived to be environmentally friendly or fair-trade products, integrating sustainability into your business will be difficult. You need to engage customers nationally about sustainability so they can make decisions based on sustainable living as well as responsible consumption. Most customers purchase products depending on the price or features, and not whether they are using recycled materials or environmentally friendly packaging. Therefore, as a business you need to engage with customers and convince them to commit to recycling, responsible consumption, carpooling and more.
4. Communicate sustainability goals throughout your organization
It is highly important that you design a way to effectively communicate your business’s vision of sustainability to everyone in your organization. Each and every individual, regardless of their role in the company, needs to understand and embrace that sustainability vision. Integration of sustainability into companies has been difficult, especially because sustainability and corporate social responsibility implementation remain the job of a single person or department within many companies.
5. Develop conditions that support sustainability-related innovations
The NBS’s report on Innovating for Sustainability, produced in 2013, described various ways companies and businesses can reduce their negative impact on the environment, create positive social changes that benefit their business, and re-create/develop their business models. As a business, you should not consider integrating innovation-related sustainability plans as risky. Instead, drive your company’s innovation by looking for trends in emerging economies and other industries, creating partnerships with colleges to fill any knowledge gaps within your organization, and developing incentives to reward employees who suggest ways to advance recycling, save energy, improve product sustainability and other ideas.
All in all, highlighting your company’s sustainability efforts and being open to the public about it can noticeably profit your company. Work on promoting your company’s use of green technology as well as other social and environmental initiatives. Your company will benefit greatly by receiving positive PR (public relations) with both your current and potential customers. .

Business as a Platform for Change
Salesforce Introduces Salesforce Sustainability Cloud, Empowering Every Business to Drive Impactful Climate Action
Built on the world’s #1 CRM, the new carbon accounting product accelerates global efforts to address the climate emergency
Salesforce reinforces sustainability commitments at UNGA and Climate Week NYC with innovative technology, stakeholder engagement and STEM investments
SAN FRANCISCO—September 18, 2019—Salesforce (NYSE: CRM), the global leader in CRM, today announced Salesforce Sustainability Cloud, a carbon accounting product for businesses to drive climate action that will accelerate the world’s efforts towards carbon neutrality. With Salesforce Sustainability Cloud, businesses now have a trusted sustainability platform that gives them a 360-degree view of their environmental impact and provides data-driven insights to make change the planet will notice.
Climate change is one of the most pressing challenges businesses are facing today, and when it comes to protecting the planet, all stakeholders have a key role to play. Global sustainable investing grew to more than $30 trillion in 2018, a 34 percent increase in two years,1 and this year CEOs cited climate change as the top risk to their organization’s growth.2
Introducing Salesforce Sustainability Cloud
Salesforce is committed to delivering a sustainable, low-carbon future and supports the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, which help frame the company’s global strategy and technology innovations. Since its founding, Salesforce has harnessed the company’s culture of innovation to drive positive social impact through serving the interests of all its stakeholders — including the environment. Salesforce’s vision is for customers to use the entire Customer 360 Platform for environmental good.
Salesforce Sustainability Cloud enables businesses to quickly track, analyze and report reliable environmental data to help them reduce their carbon emissions. A company’s carbon data is easily surfaced in Salesforce Einstein Analytics, which creates dynamic reports and dashboards—both for audit purposes and for executive engagement—with insights that empower businesses to drive climate action programs at scale.
Comments on the News
- “At Salesforce, we’ve always believed business is the greatest platform for change. Addressing climate change with speed and at scale is critical to see a turning point by 2020,” said Suzanne DiBianca, chief impact officer and EVP of corporate relations at Salesforce. “Businesses must work together to be the greatest force for climate transformation the world has ever seen.”
- “We created Salesforce Sustainability Cloud to help our customers easily generate trusted investor-grade data to inform their climate action programs,” said Patrick Flynn, vice president of sustainability at Salesforce.“Climate change is the biggest, most important and most complex challenge humans have ever faced, and we all have a role to play based on our resources to deliver a healthier planet for future generations.”
- “As a company whose core offering is inherently forest-friendly, we are helping our more than 535,000 customers save millions of trees every year and decrease their use of paper,” explained Dan Springer, CEO of DocuSign. “This focus on sustainability is why we’re excited about Salesforce’s launch of Sustainability Cloud—it has great potential to help businesses tackle climate change more effectively by providing an easy solution for tracking, evaluating and ultimately reducing their impact on the environment.”
- “We care about the environment and are conscious of our ecological footprint, while striving to minimize it,” explains Isabelle Leung-Tack, Vice President of Global Communications at Criteo. “The opportunity to work with Salesforce has been a tremendous one. Sustainability Cloud allows us to gather our entire carbon footprint, look at the data and start making a change. Our vision is that by having access to the data around our efforts, we will be able to reduce our environmental impact by identifying potential risks and taking action sooner than ever before.”
Salesforce announces new sustainability commitments
As headline sponsor of Climate Week NYC, Salesforce will join stakeholders from around the world, including government officials, businesses, NGOs and citizens, to highlight game-changing climate innovations and catalyze bold new commitments.
- Salesforce, along with a coalition of business, civil society and UN leaders, has committed to set 1.5°C science-based emissions reduction targets aligned with a net-zero future, responding to what the latest climate science indicates is needed to limit the worst impacts of climate change.
- Salesforce will participate in the first-ever UN Youth Climate Summit on Saturday, September 21 to support young leaders who are driving climate action as part of a weekend of events leading up to the UN Climate Action Summit and UNGA.
- To support STEM literacy, Salesforce is giving a $250,000 grant to EcoRise, a K–12 school-based nonprofit, to expand environmental STEM education programming in New York City schools. During Climate Week, a group of K–12 teachers will participate in a day of professional development with EcoRise, Salesforce and the DOE Office of Sustainability and receive an overview of the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals and classroom resources with a focus on Climate Action.
- As a founding member of USA Chapter of The Prince’s Accounting for Sustainability Project (A4S) CFO Leadership Network, Salesforce is excited to host the east coast launch event. A4S is aimed at enabling sustainable organizations that generate positive value for the economy, society and the environment.
Committed to a sustainable future for everyone
Salesforce is focused on creating a sustainable, low-carbon future by driving towards its Step Up Declaration commitments, delivering a carbon-neutral cloud to all customers, committing to reaching 100 percent renewable energy by 2022 and advocating for policies that set the planet, and the geographies the company operates in, on a path to a low-carbon economy.

nordicinnovation,https://www.nordicinnovation.org/circularnordic https://www.nordicinnovation.org/programs/nordic-green-growth-research-and-innovation-program ,"With Nordic Sustainable Business Transformation, Nordic Innovation aims to take circular economy from strategy to business. We support new ecosystems, piloting of new circular economy solutions, and work to increase competence and improve circularity in cities and regions through Nordic projects.
Through the program, Nordic Innovation wishes to contribute to the transition to a circular economy through entrepreneurship, innovation and competitiveness in Nordic businesses thus enabling sustainable growth in the Nordic region.
Nordic Innovation aims to kickstart the circular transition in the Nordics by bringing Nordic companies, public authorities, industries, NGOs and other stakeholders together. We support and fund projects that have the potential to generate high-impact, clear and scalable results and substantial Nordic added value (read more about how we support Nordic projects).
Sustainable growth, increased entrepreneurship, innovation and competitiveness for Nordic businesses are key in the transition to a circular economy.
Mission
- Support Nordic businesses in implementing circular business models: skills, tools & competence to lead the transition.
- Enhance awareness about circular business models.
- Build Nordic ecosystems and value chains, that make it easier for companies to implement their circular strategy and establish new partnerships.
- Facilitate the development of new Nordic solutions that can enable the transformation towards a circular economy.
- Bring Nordic companies, public authorities, industries, NGOs and other stakeholders together to identify and create synergies.
- Brand Nordic circular solutions and the Nordics as an innovative circular region to the rest of the world.
- Support Nordic cities and regions as frontrunners in shaping and implementing circularity.
Action Areas
The program is built around four action areas, which will continuously be developed as the program is progressing.
- Competence - driving change through competence and new business models.
- New Solutions - accelerating business through innovation.
- Circular Cities - public private collaboration.
- Ecosystems - building networks and connecting competences and people.
Program background
The program work began early 2018, when the team met with national stakeholders and companies in the five Nordic countries regarding the program content. The focus areas are based on Nordic strongholds, such as highly educated and digital population, adaptability and bio-based resources, as well as the needs for change that followed the Agenda 2030, Paris agreement and the UN Sustainable Development Goals.
The program is based on the Nordic Co-operation Programme for Business and Innovation Policy 2018−2021. It is one of Nordic Innovation’s three thematic priorities for the period 2018−21. A total of NOK 60 million has been allocated to the program.
The program directly supports the Nordic Prime Ministers’ vision of making the Nordic region the most sustainable, integrated region in the world by 2030. We promote a green transition in our societies and work towards carbon neutrality and a competitive sustainable circular and bio-based economy.
Funded projects can be found below the timeline. . The Nordic countries have committed themselves to ambitious climate goals towards 2050 in terms of developing energy efficient and low-carbon societies. To achieve these goals, we need extensive green transitions in all areas of the Nordic societies and economies. We need to promote green economic growth, sustainability and competitiveness both in the public and private sector.
The Nordic countries are home to excellent research and consistently rank among the best when it comes to innovation. This makes the region well-positioned to develop innovative solutions and policy advice to meet the opportunities and challenges of reaching the Nordic climate goals.
NordForsk, Nordic Innovation and Nordic Energy Research, the main financiers of cooperative research and innovation in the Nordic countries, have therefore together launched this research and innovation programme. The call received tremendous interest with 113 applications in total.
Due to the wide scope of the call, the reviewers have considered applications covering a very wide range: Solar energy, wind energy, bio-refining, efficient use of resources from food production, mining, low-carbon approaches to metallurgy, integrated and lean production methods, innovative ways to use biomass resources both for materials and societal changes to enable green growth and competitiveness in Nordic countries to name a few. We were unfortunately only able to support a fraction of all these high-quality projects.

Imagine that you are standing on a beach, flying a kite in the wind. You feel the strong lift force from the kite in the rope as the wind tries to carry the kite away. As you move the kite sideways, you notice that it flies fast – way faster than the wind is blowing.
If you would attach a turbine to the kite and put it in the ocean, where a water current flows instead of the wind blowing, you would have the concept of Deep Green, Minesto’s patented and awarded ocean energy power plant.
Expanding the ocean energy potential
What makes Deep Green different from other tidal energy technologies is the wing, the size of the turbine and the fact that the power plant is “flying” under water. The wing pushes the turbine through the water in an eight-shaped trajectory, sweeping a large area at a relative speed that is several times the actual speed of the underwater current.
The speed has a cubic relationship to the power production. This means that when Deep Green multiplies the relative speed which the turbine is pushed through the water, the electricity produced by the power plant's generator is several hundred times greater compared to if the turbine would be stationary.
By adding this step of energy conversion, Minesto expands the global ocean energy potential.
How it works
Minesto’s marine energy technology, called Deep Green, generates electricity from low-flow tidal streams and ocean currents by a unique and patented principle similar to a stunt kite flying in the wind.
The wing uses the hydrodynamic lift force created by the underwater current to move the kite. With onboard control system and rudders, the kite is autonomously steered in a pre-determined figure of eight, pushing the turbine through the water. By doing so, the turbine experiences a water flow several times higher than the actual stream speed.
The turbine diffuse power to the generator which outputs electricity via power cable in the tether. Seabed umbilical transfers the electricity to the onshore connection.
Power plant parts
The power plant consists of a wing (1), which carries a turbine (2) directly coupled to a generator in a nacelle (3). Rudders (4) and control system steers the kite in the predetermined trajectory. The struts (5) are via a top joint connected to the tether (6), which is connected to a bottom joint at the seabed foundation. The tether accommodates the tether rope and cables for communication and power distribution.
Competetive advantages
Market exclusivity
Deep Green is the only known technology to cost-effectively produce electricity at sites with velocities between 1.2–2.4 m/s and depths of more than 60 meters.
Small in size and lightweight
Up to 15 times less per MW than competing technologies.
Low-cost offshore operations
Smaller vessels and equipment are used for installation, service and maintenance. Detachable design concept enables service and maintenance on shore.
No visual, minimal environmental impact
Deep Green operates completely submerged below the water surface, in unison with the marine environment.
Predictable electricity production
Tides are generated by the relative motion of the Earth, sun and moon, which can be calculated with almost 100% accuracy. Ocean currents are nearly constant.
Utilisation of ocean currents
The ability to operate at low velocities makes Minesto's Deep Green the only technology to be cost-efficient in both tidal and ocean currents.

Book Description
The most important theme of the discourse on sustainable development and sustainability challenges concerns the relationship between innovation and sustainability. This book represents a realistic critical overview of the state of affairs of sustainable innovations, offering an accessible and comprehensive diagnostic point of reference for both the academic and practitioner worlds. In order for sustainable innovation to truly become mainstream practice in business it is necessary to find out how organizations can strategically and efficiently accommodate sustainability and innovation in such a manner that they accomplish value capturing (for firms, stakeholders, and for society), not merely creating a return on the social responsibility agenda. Addressing this challenge, the book draws together research from a range of perspectives in order to understand the potential shifts and barriers, benefits, and outcomes from all angles: inception, strategic process, and impact for companies and society. The book also delivers insights of (open) innovation in public sector organizations, which is not so much a process of invention as it is one of adoption and diffusion. It examines how the environmental pillar of the triple bottom line in private firms is often a by-product of thinking about the economic pillar, where cost reductions may be achieved through process innovation in terms of eliminating waste and reducing energy consumption. The impact of open innovation on process innovation, and sustainable process innovation in particular, is an underexplored area but is examined in this book. It also considers the role of the individual entrepreneur in bringing about sustainable innovation; entrepreneurs, their small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), as well as the innovation ecosystems they build play a significant role in generating sustainable innovations where these smaller organizations are much more flexible than large organizations in targeting societal needs and challenges. The readership will incorporate PhD students and postgraduate researchers, as well as practitioners from organizational advisory fields.

Print has undergone major change over the past few years, with companies now faced with a host of new challenges from ever-demanding customers. One of the key trends to emerge in recent times is the call for more sustainable print, with more consumers looking to do their part and protect the environment.
For the print service provider (PSP), this can mean huge changes throughout the print production service. From investing in more efficient machinery that uses less electricity, to recycling waste materials, there are several ways companies can enhance their ‘green’ image.
Here, we focus on how the choice of paper can not only satisfy customer demand for sustainable printed products, but also place your company in a new light and cut your own carbon footprint.
Spreading the sustainable message of print and paper
Antalis is one of the leading names in paper manufacturing that is committed to developing new products with sustainable features. Matthew Botfield, corporate social responsibility manager, said it is more important than ever for PSPs to look at these papers, citing a stat that 33% of consumers now choose to buy from brands they believe are doing social or environmental good.
Botfield admits the pressure is on also PSPs to demonstrate how paper and print, once perceived as being harmful to the environment, are a greener option than digital media. He gives two examples: first, displaying a page for three minutes on a screen consumes more energy than producing a printed version of that page, and second, sending 20 emails a day over one year emits as much CO2 as driving 1,000km by car.
“It is important to point out that paper is one of the few products which is completely sustainable and that the paper industry is actually one of the biggest users of renewable energy,” he said.
Botfield was also keen to address the concerns PSPs may have about sustainable papers in terms of their quality: “Today’s green paper options have improved tremendously, meaning customers won’t have to compromise on quality, performance, appearance or whiteness – offering the perfect solution for those seeking to stay one step ahead of the green curve.”
To support this, Antalis has developed the ‘Green Star System’, which rates each paper with a star according to its environmental performance. Ranking high is the Cyclus range of 100% recycled paper, made exclusively from recycled fibre yet boasts a superb quality and texture, according to Botfield.
Caption:Antalis has developed the ‘Green Star System’ to rank its papers with a star, according to its environmental performance.
“To showcase its environmental credentials, consider that using one tonne of Cyclus Offset 100% recycled paper instead of virgin fibre paper saves the equivalent of 1,231kg of landfill, 3,794 kWh of electricity, 29,800lof water, 2,000kg of wood and 295kg CO2 and greenhouse gases,” Botfield said.
For large-format substrates, Antalis has added Xanita, an ultra-lightweight and sustainable composite fibre-board solution. Made from recycled cardboard boxes, Xanita board is a 100% repulpable engineered, closed-cell fibre-board, manufactured with a corrugated kraft core.
Botfield said: “Its advanced design technology has rendered the product lightweight yet robust, making it a perfect alternative to single use plastic POS materials.
Botfield went on to outline Antalis’ ongoing commitment to sustainable paper production: “With a significant proportion of Antalis’ global turnover deriving from paper-based products, we are a business that relies heavily on natural resources. Recognising that 80% of the world’s biodiversity lives within forest areas, one of the key priorities within our CSR agenda is to ensure responsible sourcing of our products, thus encouraging the circular economy.
“As such, we have prioritised the traceability of our products for a long time. The majority of our supplies come from FSC or PEFC certified fibrous products and/or recycled products and we have committed to cover 85% of our supply with a responsible traceability process by 2020.”
Maintaining print quality with sustainable paper
Antalis works in partnership with Arjowiggins Graphic on product development, and scoring five out of five on the Green Star System is Cocoon. Developed by Arjowiggins, this is extra-white, 60 and 100% recycled, Forest Stewardship Council (FSC)-certified paper is engineered from high-quality waste office paper sourced locally from the UK and France. The range covers all types of applications and printing technologies.
Caption:All Arjowiggins paper mills comply with the ISO 14001 Environmental Management standard
Like Antalis, Arjowiggins is committed to working with its customers to help them identify the sustainable paper best suited to their business. Virginie Gohlinger, operational marketing manager at Arjowiggins, said the company is focused on bringing to market new solutions that limit the use of natural resources and reuse materials, while at the same time reduce waste.
Gohlinger said: “We’re continually looking to achieve cleaner, whiter recycled papers. Our ranges offer more than a hundred recycled options, from 25% to 100% post-consumer waste, from smooth, textured or coated whites to coloured boards. Respect to the environment is an integral part of our production process.”
All papers from Arjowiggins are certified by both the FSC and European Climate Forum, while the company’s mills comply with the ISO 14001 Environmental Management standard. Arjowiggins opts for alternative materials in its papers, such as fast-growing, renewable bamboo fibres and by-products from the food industry.
Gohlinger added: “We are working hard with our R&D department to innovate in new bio products, such as in the nanofibers technology. New processes are being designed thanks to the cellulose properties, in order to propose some innovative materials which are lighter but still very rigid at the same time.”
High performance, lower environmental impact
Casting the net a little wider and Fedrigoni, which specialises in fine papers, is also placing a focus on sustainable products. Chiara Medioli, global marketing director, said the company has seen a sharp rise in demand for such papers and expects this to rise further as customers seek to improve their environmental image.

Medioli said: “Our commitment is to produce even more consistent, eco-friendly products. This means improving production processes with less impact on the environment, meaning energy saving, reduction of water consumption, waste production and emissions into the atmosphere.
“A close collaboration with our chemical suppliers allows us to substitute and introduce ingredients even more technically performing and with less impact.”
Fedrigoni only uses wood sourced from sustainable forests that comply with strict FSC standards in terms of traceability and controlled wood origin. The company has taken this a step further by obtaining the ISO 14001: 2004 Environmental Management System to showcase it sown green credentials.
In addition, due to its commitment to using all recyclable waste from production, Fedrigoni has been able to develop a new, sustainable paper product in the form of Freelife’.
Medioli said: “These paper have high recycling content and are developed in different finishes, some of which contain fibres from annual crops like cotton or hemp.”
Elsewhere,Innova Art also offers a range of high quality papers, with a focus on fine art and photographic digital inkjet media. David Williams, global supply chain and quality manager, said as federal and regional regulations regarding the use of paper continue to strengthen, demand for sustainable products will grow.
Caption:Innova Art said that all of its activities in terms of manufacturing paper are consistent with environmentally friendly practices. Pictured: Innova Editions, available in roll and sheet formats.
Williams added: “This will require manufacturers to make more environmentally friendly products. Large, multinational companies will insist on their supply chain having these types of products.
“Our main activities within Innova Art are consistent with environmentally friendly practices. All developments for new papers will be on either sustainably sourced alpha cellulose, 100% cotton fibre, or a combination of the two.”
With this in mind, Williams draws attention to the latest paper product on offer from Innova Art in the form of Eco Solvent Poster Art Paper 210gsm. Available from the first quarter of 2019, this paper is made from sustainably sourced alpha cellulose fibres, a water-based ink receptive coating, and designed to work with all modern eco-solvent and latex printers.
Williams added: “Eco Solvent Poster Art Paper 210gsm provides great image quality, easy handling, and can be recycled when the job is done.”
Whichever way you look at it, sustainability should be a key consideration for all modern print businesses. Customers’ demands and requirements are leaning more towards greener solutions and, in order to keep hold of these clients and ensure repeat business, you should consider switching your own focus to ensure you can deliver what they want.
As well as assisting your customers, switching to more sustainable production methods will mean you are helping the planet. The environment has been a hot topic for some time now, with various groups, politicians and influential figures urging companies to change their ways and limit damage to our surroundings.
Using sustainable paper products will go a long way to ensuring forests, and the wildlife that flourishes in them, will survive for many years to come.
by Rob Fletcher . FESPA hosted its first virtual Global Summit on 20 – 21 January 2021, welcoming over 165 delegates from 36 countries. The Global Summit, an exclusive event funded by FESPA’s Profit for Purpose programme, invited some of the world’s leading printers to connect, learn and debate about the future of the speciality print industry.
The two-day summit, hosted by Pedro Jacques de Sousa, International Executive Director at Digital Graphics Group International, was a participative and interactive event featuring a comprehensive programme of presentations.

- In sustainable business and investing discussions, we need to understand who is most impacted, and to prioritize and amplify their voices.
- The sustainable business movement can and should do a better job bringing under-served and environmentally disadvantaged communities (i.e. historically black and brown people) to the table.
- Compassionate business is sustainable business.

Melted glaciers, decimated forests, and extinct wildlife species are the result of climate change. Consuming and investing sustainably can help foster progress toward reversing some of those catastrophes, but businesses can do more.
Sustainable business practice is about much more than planting trees, saving polar bears, or buying environmentally friendly ETFs.
It’s about knowing how climate change, air pollution, and lack of access to green space poison and kill lower income communities that are disproportionately black and brown — and about investing in actionable, measurable solutions that can change this.

Redlining and the need for sustainable business
How do the environment and sustainability intersect with class and race?
Redlining is a great example. These geographical zones, traced in red by lenders practicing decades-long housing discrimination, were in many cases undesirable neighborhoods with little green space and lots of industrial plants.
In many communities, redlining created ongoing health crises that have recently been further exacerbated by COVID-19, a sign the practice — which is now illegal —continues to plague communities today through the health and economic disparities it created.
“’I can’t breathe’ resonates with today’s social injustice, and it’s also what communities of color were saying in the early 1980s because of exposure to toxic fumes and environmental injustice,” says Dr Robert Bullard, Distinguished Professor of Urban Planning and Environmental Policy at Texas Southern University.
“Each day, you didn’t know if the chemicals in the air would kill you. Toxic terror is what people experienced in Louisiana’s ‘cancer alley’.”
Residents in ‘cancer alley’ (a stretch of the state full of refineries and industrial plants) have cancer rates nearly 50 per cent higher than the average American, and COVID-19 numbers are some of the highest in the country.
Urban areas lacking the lush vegetation and green plant life found in affluent neighborhoods are called ‘heat islands,’ and the way they absorb heat can lead to respiratory issues.
In addition to the health dangers, there are economic repercussions to living in such poor environmental conditions. For example, as the world continues to experience extreme weather, flood zone residents may see flood insurance as cost prohibitive.
“With the environment, we’re trying to deal with the water, the air, the animals, the trees, but we suck at how we deal with each other. Treating the environment well means treating humans well,” says Dr Thomas RaShad Easley, assistant dean at the Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies.
Putting humans at the center is one way businesses and communities can confront issues around sustainability, race, and class head on.
How can sustainable business solve the problem?
Companies that want to drive progress can use the three ways below to help defeat environmental injustice:
1. Engage directly with the communities where you do business
Sustainable businesses understand that they work within an ecosystem of customers, partners, shareholders, and communities, and they leverage all these resources to solve problems.
“Those in underserved communities can inform the scientists about what they’re seeing. Those scientists, academics, and community members can jointly inform companies and explain how their practices may be hurting the community,” says Easley.
People inside and outside business are demanding change, making constructive engagement all the more necessary.
Sally Eaves, chief technology officer at Forbes Technology and founder of Aspirational Futures, says: “The biggest change, and what I’m really optimistic about, is that consumers, employees, supply chains, and different stakeholders are all collectively driving this and holding businesses to account.”
2. Make a plan, make an investment
Firms will benefit from driving an all-encompassing sustainability agenda.
Luke Manning, Global Head of Sustainability and Enterprise Risk at Refinitiv, says: “If we want to truly progress the climate agenda, we need to help everyone understand that tackling it is in all our personal and financial self-interests. It’s not just about the impact we are having on the environment, but the impact the environment is having on us.”
Firms like Refinitiv are setting science-based carbon emissions reduction targets to create long-term goals around climate change and sustainability.
A firm’s industry and region may have a role to play in its specific contributions, but generally companies must plan and use all the intelligence and investment resources at their disposal to create measurable results.
3. Share your stories
We each have different experiences and knowledge gaps around sustainable business.
Over the last few weeks, we’ve learned valuable lessons about active listening. Let’s be willing to share knowledge throughout our sustainability and ESG business departments about how environmental issues impact us differently so we can find solutions.
“If we don’t address climate change and global warming, we’ll see historically marginalized populations become further marginalized,” says Dr Robert Bullard.
Moving sustainable business forward can be the difference between life and death in our communities.
ESG data from the Diversity and Inclusion Index provides performance information for in-depth, socially responsible investment analysis . What does Refinitiv data say about how the European Commission’s (EC) goal of putting sustainability at the heart of the European financial system is being aligned with the urgent need to fund the COVID-19 recovery?
- EU member states are in urgent need of recovery funds to mitigate the economic impact of COVID-19. However, there is also an urgent need to put sustainability at the heart the European financial system.
- Is it possible for these two priorities to be aligned with one another, and the EC’s goal of sustainability to be successfully implemented? And are those countries that will receive the bulk of the recovery funds prepared to deploy the funds to support sustainable growth?
- Refinitiv data looked at which member states are well placed to uphold the vision of an environmentally and socially responsible recovery.

Europe has been badly hit by COVID-19. The IMF predicts 2020 GDP will fall by 10.2 percent and rebound by 6 percent in 2021 for the Euro area1.
The crisis is not yet over, nor are the GDP predictions fixed, however on 21 July the EU reached a political agreement on the 2021-2027 Multiannual Financing Framework (MFF) budget.
ESG Data: Refinitiv provides a rich source of ESG data, covering 80 percent of global market cap, spanning 76 countries
The overall commitment is €1,074bn, with an extra recovery instrument of €750bn for the sole purpose of addressing the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.
The additional €750bn has been coined the ‘Next Generation EU’ Fund (NGEU). It will be composed of €390bn in grants and €360bn in loans. The NGEU will be funded by allowing the European Commission to borrow directly on the financial markets for the first time in its history.
The NGEU is divided into seven programs. The biggest of these is the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF), which will act as direct aid to member states, and contains €312.5bn in grants.
Watch: Is Europe united on a rescue plan? — The Corona Correction
Who gets the economic vaccine?
Since the pandemic took hold, European policymakers and central bankers have been considering their options. This included early discussions on ‘CoronaBonds’ and national level debt issuance. These discussions evolved into the NGEU, which should come into effect on 1 January 2021.
However, allocation of the funds from the NGEU has not yet been finalized and will be based on member states’ recovery and resilience plans for 2021-2023, which will be developed at the country level and then assessed by the EU Commission.
The ambition is for the NGEU to be a green stimulus package in the COVID-19 response, reflecting the commission’s commitment to sustainability and the green agenda. However, it has also highlighted differences between member states’ prioritization of sustainable finance.
The political agreement on the recovery fund notably contains a conditionality on disbursement based on requirements on the rule of law, as well as effective contribution to the green and digital transition. On paper, the EU remains committed to a ‘Just Recovery’.
Although it is too early to determine exactly how much each member state will get from the NGEU, the political agreement indicates that 70 percent of the NGEU will be allocated according to the current MFF key and the remaining 30 percent will be allocated by considering the real GDP loss suffered by affected countries.
As the financial impacts of COVID-19 become clearer, the countries with the highest projected GDP loss so far are Italy, Spain and France, and they are therefore likely to be top of the list of disbursements of grants and loans.
In addition, and if funds are allocated according to the proposed MFF key, the allocation from the RFF of €312.5bn in grants from the NGEU fund could include these 10 countries:
Supporting EU sustainability
Are the member states who are poised to receive the lion’s share of the MFF and NGEU prepared to deploy the funds to support sustainable growth?
Refinitiv data shows that despite the economic shock of the pandemic, sustainable investment remained strong globally.
In the first quarter of 2020, ESG funds saw inflows of US$36bn. The region that recorded the largest inflows was Europe excl. UK, with US$17bn. During the period, the majority of ESG funds have outperformed their technical indicators.4
This bodes well for Europe, but the question remains whether all EU 27 countries are equally ready for a Just Recovery. To get some indication of the potential for a sustainable recovery in Europe, we need to consider member states’ ability to support a Just Recovery by combining:
- Percentage of green debt issued in 2020 YTD
- Overall Refinitiv ESG5 score of their national index
- Existing country-level commitment to a green transition6
Using this system, the top three countries are Spain, followed by France, and Germany. Employing the same methodology, the bottom three countries are Poland, Romania, and Bulgaria.
Which member states are best prepared?
If applied across the all 27 EU member states, and taking into account the overall green debt issued by each country, Finland, Spain and France are the three most prepared countries for a Just Recovery.
This highlights significant risk to an EU green recovery plan. Italy, the country most likely to be the beneficiary of EU funding from the MFF, is less prepared to deploy those funds sustainably.
Spain and France, also likely to receive high levels of EU funding from the MFF, are poised to play an important role in upholding a green recovery because they scored highly on their preparedness.
Meanwhile, Poland ranked low on the preparedness scale, but high on the receipt of both grants and loans (ranking third overall). These discrepancies may signal that it may be difficult to implement a green recovery in Europe.
It is important to note that on top of the level of preparedness of the EU 27, there is a wide disparity in financial market depth and maturity. This will affect both economic recovery and investor requirements in various markets.
The path to sustainability
At a time where the EU is making plans to inject significant amounts of money into countries and companies, keeping a close eye on recipient countries’ ability to deploy capital to sustainable projects will be essential to protect the European New Green Deal.
There needs to be a consistent approach to deploying funds for recovery, which has not necessarily been on track in recent months. The unprecedented level of state aid approved by the EC since March 2020 was not assessed or approved with a green transition lens7 in mind.
According to the EC, from the start of May, it had approved an estimated EUR 1.9 trillion in state aid to the EU economy. This corresponded with the total seven-year MFF-NGEU fund proposal made by the EC. These early funds may already have gone towards industries directly threatening the green transition.
Listen: Moving Forward With Transition Finance: Your 360° Overview
It will take a concerted effort by the EC, the member states, policymakers, and global investors to make the EU’s plans for a Just Recovery a reality.
Refinitiv’s initial data assessment suggests some of the European ‘winners’ in terms of receipt of funds, are the ‘losers’ in terms of their green finance deployment track record.
More than ever, data will be key in determining and understanding how successful and green the EU will be on its path to recovery.

Sustainable Finance & Central Banks
Addressing the threat of climate change requires a major shift in how financial resources are allocated. Positive Money campaigns to align the European Central Bank’s monetary policy with the EU’s sustainability goals.
Climate change is probably the biggest challenge our society is facing right now. Massive investment is needed: the European Commission estimates 180 billion euros per year is needed for the next two decades in order to finance renewable energy, green transportation systems, and make our buildings energy efficient.
Unfortunately, the current financial system is not helping. Right now, investors still have many incentives to put their money into fossil fuel industries and speculative activities, instead of towards the investment we need to transition the economy. Economists describe this phenomenon as the “tragedy of the horizon”: the financial sector tends to focus on short term profits, while society as a whole needs finance to look at long-term sustainability.
Climate change itself is a threat to the stability of the financial system. The value of many financial assets rests on the future use and extraction of fossil fuels. The financial system could collapse when society moves away from the carbon economy, destroying entire sectors of the current economy – wiping out billions of underlying investments.
In 2015, the European Union ratified the Paris climate agreement, which clearly acknowledges that the green transition cannot happen unless financial flows are aligned with the climate change goals. We can’t do that unless the ECB is involved.
No green finance without green central banks
Among the EU institutions, an important conversation on “sustainable finance” has already started. In 2017, the European Commission launched a high-level group of experts who formulated a list of recommendations to the EU.
Recommendations include changing incentives within the financial sector itself, for example by forcing all companies and investors to disclose the carbon-impact of their investments.
While this strategy is needed, there is a danger that this will move finance too slowly.
Positive Money thinks the planet cannot afford to wait for the private sector to catch up with the necessity of tackling climate change. The public sector needs to step up to pioneer the investment needed in greening the economy. Central banks are no exception to that.
Positive Money’s goal is to make sure that the ECB and national central banks in the Eurozone adjust their policies to the EU’s environmental commitments.
Central banks have powerful tools such as collateral eligibility requirements and quantitative easing in order to steer the financial markets towards better capital allocation. Unfortunately those instruments are currently exacerbating climate change. For example, the ECB has invested more than 130 billions euros into corporate bonds that contribute massively to greenhouse gas emissions. This kind of policies should either stop or incorporate sustainability criteria.
Instead of just purchasing what the current market offers and perpetuating the status quo, the European Central Bank could directly provide funding for pan-european investments into green infrastructure.
How to green the European Central Bank
In February 2018, the European Parliament adopted a report which recalls that the ECB is bound by the Paris agreement, and therefore should start taking action on the matter. Positive Money’s goal is to push the Parliament’s report further by making the ECB comply with the Paris agreement ratification.
Our campaigns and advocacy work currently cover the following proposals to make central banks green:

ECB trails Chinese and Brazilian central banks in combating climate change
Why green monetary policy is legal and legitimate
Those sceptical that the European Central Bank (ECB) should its green monetary policy claim this is not compatible with the ECB’s mandate, and that this would be undemocratic. But fighting climate change is part of the ECB’s mandate, and democratically elected politicians can legitimise a greener approach.
1. CENTRAL BANK DISCLOSURE OF THEIR CARBON IMPACT
As part of quantitative easing, the ECB has injected more than 130 billions euros into corporate bonds. As a study by the Grantham Institute (LSE) showed, the bulk of this money is invested by the ECB into multinational companies who contribute most to climate change.
The first step for central banks to green their activities consist in taking stock of the current impact of their policies, such as the Corporate Sector Purchase Programme.
Together with partners from civil society, we are currently asking the ECB and various national central banks to make their own assessment of the carbon impact of their market operations.
2. STOP ECB SUBSIDIZING FOSSIL FUEL COMPANIES
Positive Money argues that the ECB should at the very least exclude companies involved in fossil fuel activities of the list of eligible companies to the quantitative easing programme. Since 2017, we have been coordinating a coalition of more than 70 NGOs who agree that the ECB should stop dirtying its hands this way.
This would pave the way for an overall update of the ECB’s collateral eligibility framework to make sure that all standard market activities of the ECB incorporate sustainability criteria.
3. GREEN MACROPRUDENTIAL POLICY
On top of monetary policy, the ECB and national central banks have been tasked to supervise the stability of the financial system. They do this through microprudential and macroprudential policies, and other regulatory measures.
Because climate change is a threat to financial stability, we advocate for central banks to implement green macroprudential policies. In practice, those measures would discourage investors from investing into fossil fuel assets, by imposing a higher capital requirement on those assets. This essentially forces banks and investors to keep higher capital buffers and ensure the financial system is less leveraged and therefore less prone to provoke a financial crisis.
4. USE QUANTITATIVE EASING TO BOOST THE GREEN TRANSITION
It does not make sense to sacrifice public investment through austerity policies when at the same time the European Central Bank is injecting more than 2.5 trillion euros into financial markets through quantitative easing.
Quantitative easing is so far a wasted opportunity to boost investments into the green transition. Positive Money has been campaigning since 2015 for a “green quantitative easing”. With this alternative approach the ECB could allocate a significant part of the QE programme specifically towards investment into the green transition.
We are part of a large coalition of NGOs and prominent academics and politicians who think the ECB should allocate 1 trillion euros to finance the energy transition.

Targeting a sustainable recovery with Green TLTROs (2020)
The EU today faces two dramatic challenges: the COVID-19 Pandemic and the climate transition. The EU’s recovery plan for the pandemic falls far short of the estimated €2 trillion needed for achieving a sustainable recovery in line with the EU’s environmental objectives.
This report from Positive Money Europe and the Sustainable Finance Lab explains how the European Central Bank can incentivize private banks to lend more money for green investments. By tweaking its Targeted Longer-Term Refinancing Operations (TLTROs) programme, the ECB could make green lending much more affordable for small businesses and households.
The ECB and climate change: outlining a vision for success (2020)
The EU economy urgently requires innovative and bold reforms that reshape finance, so that it can help sustain our planet and enable us to thrive.
In this policy briefing, co-written with the New Economics Foundation and 350.org, we offer policymakers a list of recommendations that, if implemented by the ECB, would constitute a successful strategic review from a climate justice perspective.
Aligning monetary policy with the European Union's climate targets (2019)
This analysis of the European Central Bank’s corporate bonds portfolio reveals a worrying gap between the ECB’s quantitative easing programme and the European Union’s climate objectives.
This report, co-written by Stanislas Jourdan (Positive Money Europe) and Wojtek Kalinowski (Veblen Institute), includes an exclusive analysis of the corporate-sector purchase programme (CSPP) by the European Central Bank (ECB). The report was originally published in French (here).
Central Banks, Climate Change and the Transition to a Low-Carbon Economy (New Economics Foundation - 2017)
While central banks have played an increasingly interventionist role in our economies since the financial crisis, this has not coincided with any significant adjustment of their policies to support a low-carbon transition.
This briefing explain how central banks should play a more prominent role in supporting a low-carbon transition rather than maintain the status quo; the authors also identify some policy interventions that could help central banks address the growing challenges of climate change. In particular, they recommend a green macroprudential policy approach, green credit allocation interventions, and greening central bank balance sheets (also known as ‘Green QE’).
The Climate impact of Quantitative Easing (LSE - Grantham Institute - 2017)
Both climate change and the low-carbon transition are likely to have deep implications for the functioning and stability of the macro financial system. The discussion of possible risks has largely focused on the private sector; however, this paper argues that central banks should also consider how their operation of monetary policy could affect the transition to a low-carbon economy. Even supposedly market-neutral interventions by central banks may show an unintended structural bias towards carbon-intensive industry incumbents.
The role of central banks in enhancing Green finance (UNEP - 2017)
The paper examines the role of central banks in ‘greening’ financial systems. Given the enormous investment needed to bring about a green transformation, the financial sector will have to play a central role in allocating resources towards a sustainable and green economy – and stop financing activities that harm the environment. Against this backdrop, the paper examines the extent to which environmental factors impinge on central banks’ conventional goals and provides a theoretical analysis of the cases for and against central banks to respond to environmental and sustainability challenges. Moreover, the paper explores the ways in which central banks (as well as financial regulatory authorities) can impact investment decisions and the creation and allocation of credit through monetary as well as micro- and macroprudential policies.
What Role for Financial Supervisors in Addressing Systemic Environmental Risks? (DSF - 2015)
Since the global financial crisis, financial supervisors have developed a new macroprudential policy framework to identify systemic financial imbalances and address these. At the same time, a literature is rapidly developing on financial shocks that may originate from ecological imbalances and climate related risk (physical, transition and liability risks).
However, financial supervisors have so far given little attention to this ecological dimension. This allows systemic financial imbalances resulting from ecological pressures to build up and concentrate in financial institutions and markets. This paper sketches the ecological dimension of the macroprudential policy framework and illustrates the working for the case of carbon emissions.
The Power of the Eurosystem to promote environmental protection
The misalignment of the Corporate Sector Purchase Programme (CSPP) with the EU’s environmental commitments has stirred a lot of political debate in recent months. This essay puts forward the argument that the Eurosystem is bound by article 11 TFEU to integrate environmental objectives into the mandate of the Eurosystem. On this basis, the essay provides a critical analysis of the validity of the controversial CSPP.

wamda,https://www.wamda.com/2012/04/4-reasons-why-smart-businesses-go-green ,"4 Reasons Why Smart Businesses Go Green
So green is now a trend in the Middle East – even though it’s still to catch on in Saudi Arabia. It's also a term that's been going around for quite some time in different parts of the world. But what's the real deal with ""Going Green""? And why should businesses care?
Sustainability support initiative Naqa'a shares with you the basic four ""Why Go Green?"" drivers of any business:
1. Go Green for the Environment
This may not be your top reason of why you should Go Green, but it definitely is the main reason behind the concept of environmental sustainability. Why? Simply because you won't have a business if you don't have a planet to do your business on!
Not convinced? Here are some business-environment facts you may not be aware of:
- The average business consumes 3.6 tons of paper/year - The equivalence of a large garden full of trees. Assuming an average sized city has 100 businesses, imagine the amount of land they use up every year.
- The average business consumes 480,000 m3 of water/year – This equals 2 million, 400 thousand barrels of water! The sad thing is: more than 20% of that water is not needed.
- The average business consumes 1,175,000 KWH/year – that's enough to power 65 average sized homes for a whole year! Now get this, businesses account for 40% of all energy consumption in a country.
It's also very important to note that your effort in maintaining eco-friendly business practices is a social obligation to your community- simply because businesses share their environment with other stakeholder groups.
2. Go Green to Reduce Waste & Decrease Costs
Suppose a business decides to go green, the first most obvious change noticed (and required) is a reduction in waste, which ultimately means a decrease in costs. The two combined result in the overall improvement of business efficiency. How? Take the following examples: turning off unneeded lights in your office is guaranteed to reduce your energy consumption, just as printing less paper or on both sides of the paper is guaranteed to cut down on your paper consumption. Also, refilling your ink cartilages instead of throwing them away and buying new ones will reduce the amount of plastic you throw away each year. Actions like these basically mean you get to decrease your utility costs and even better, increase your company's bottom line.
Improving efficiency and lowering operating costs can pretty much save your business hundreds of thousands per year! While some cost reductions (like paper costs) can be seen instantly, others will be enjoyed in the long-term; this is in the example of installing energy saving lighting.
Generally speaking, some of the benefits green businesses enjoy include:
- 15% reduction in paper consumption & costs.
- 20% reduction in water consumption & costs.
- 30% reduction in energy consumption & costs.
Note that these percentages are average, and may decrease or increase depending on the level of each business's green efforts.
3. Go Green for Public Image & Increased Sales
A polished public image is a great free benefit of going green, and for many reasons. For starter, people love organizations that ""care."" Studies show that consumers are more attracted (and loyal) to companies that regard the environment. In the last decade, environmental issues moved from being under the shadows into an extremely serious topic, to the extent that consumers are no longer looking at ""going green"" as an added effort, but they actually demand it.
A natural effect of positive public image is guaranteed to increase sales. Studies have shown that companies with green initiatives, and better still – green products, have witnessed an increase in their profits.
Take Walmart and Target as an example. After incorporating green initiatives, including recycling, enhancing transportation to reduce gas, and increasing stocks of green products, they actually recorded a 20% increase in sales!
Public image may not be the best motive for going green for many businesses, but the benefits coming with it are pretty attractive for any company.
4. Go Green for your Employees!
The why's of going green are not all external, for many companies internal reasons are far more important. Why? Well, look at it this way: just like you can't have a business if you don't have a planet to do it on, you CAN'T have a business if you don't have employees to run it for you! Your employees are actually one of the biggest stakeholders – many even consider them more important than clients. For that reason, smart companies try to provide the best working environment for their employees. And yes, that affects productivity.
So how does going green affect your employees? There are many aspects, but the major ones include providing a ""healthy"" atmosphere. For instance, indoor air quality (IAQ) is typically two to five times worse than the air outdoor; employees working in such unhealthy environment have been noted to suffer health issues such as headaches and asthma. On the other hand, research shows that companies with better IAQ show less absenteeism due to sickness and an increase in employee productivity. Other reasons include attracting and retaining talented employees. It's actually becoming quite common for employees – especially young professionals - to seek companies that are environmentally responsible. Not only that, but taking a green initiative is known to improve employee morale and loyalty; and what do you get when you have satisfied employees? You've only to look at Google to answer that question.
So there you have it, the most comprehensive four ""Why go green?"" reasons any business needs to know. Not all business owners realize the importance of applying eco-friendly practices, but we hope that the smart ones will. .

nordforsk,https://www.nordforsk.org/programs/nordic-research-and-innovation-programme-sustainable-aquaculture ,"Objectives
The overarching aim of the Programme is to generate knowledge and solutions for sustainable land-based and marine salmonid aquaculture in the Nordic countries. The Programme also aims to promote Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) perspectives in sustainable aquaculture within a Nordic context including diversity, inclusion, openness and transparency.
Four crucial and inter-related areas of priority for a joint Nordic research and innovation programme in sustainable salmonid aquaculture are identified.
1) Aquaculture microbiome systems
2) Aquaculture feeding systems
3) Biotechnological advances
4) Aquaculture ""big data"" monitoring and control systems.
Background
Aquaculture is a growing global business, which faces many facets of sustainability challenges, including careful management of effluents and waste, disease-related losses, the effect on greenhouse gas emission, and social acceptance.
As aquaculture gains an increasing global market, more light will be shed on its effect on greenhouse gas (GHG) emission. Aquaculture is contributing to the GHG load directly via the production of fish and crustaceans and indirectly via production, processing and logistics of particularly feed, but also end-products and waste. However, aquaculture offers a degree of climate resilience and elasticity, as it is mostly based on organisms feeding in the low end the food chain and in some cases even assist in carbon sequestration (seaweed, molluscs).
Social acceptance of aquaculture is not a given, albeit contributing to local growth and employment. Local communities, consumers and NGOs all question aquaculture production and the public sector need to stimulate aquaculture in new ways, adapting flexible regulation to future needs and requirements.
Programme Committee
The programme committee comprises representatives for the participating funding organisations:
- Kjell Maroni, R&D Director, Norwegian Seafood Research Fund (chair)
- Kolbrún Bjargmundsdóttir, Rannis, Iceland
- Orian Bondestam, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry in Finland
- Jan Mousing, Innovation Fund Denmark
- Inger Oline Røsvik, the Research Council of Norway
- Katrin Saar, the Estonian Research Council
- Aleksandrs Mārtiņš Blūms, the Ministry of Education and Science of the Republic of Latvia
- Johanna von Schaik Dernfark, the Swedish Research Council Formas
- Annika Sølvara, Research Council Faroe Islands (observer)

pbs,https://www.pbs.org/independentlens/blog/earth-day-watch-list-17-new-films-about-sustainability-climate-change/ ,"We count on indie filmmakers to sniff out the conspicuous absences in mainstream media. Journalist and investigative reporter Amy Goodman once said, “The role of independent media is to go to where the silence is.” To environmentalists and scientists, the silence around climate change is deafening. And as environmental themes and issues are always on everyone’s mind when Earth Day rolls around, we compiled a list of very worthwhile independent films that tell stories about sustainability and climate change. [updated April 2020]
An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power [and An Inconvenient Truth]
Even before An Inconvenient Truth garnered two Academy Awards, including Best Documentary, the sequel was already in the offing. The intervening decade has brought a furious acceleration of climate discoveries, natural disasters, changes in the global economy and in the US political climate. How could the directors give us anything but a completely different film? Describing the sequel as “primarily a verité film,” director Bonni Cohen says, “Hopefully what comes across is his tenacity and his pursuit to combat the [climate] crisis 24 hours a day.” And his humor. Gore still uses his old chestnuts like “it’s a nature hike through the Book of Revelations,” but with his blend of optimism and dry wit, the new film feels like it has more levity than the first. Wide release in the summer.
One side note (per Hollywood Reporter): Although one scene shows Gore’s visit to Trump Tower for that well-publicized meeting, the movie gives nothing away about Gore’s views on the president, suggestive to some of Gore’s own political aspirations.
Critics have a few beefs with this short nature VR film (also narrated by Al Gore), suggesting that while VR might be a fine medium for sweeping landscape or nudging at our empathy neurons, it is just too much for a short film trying to do both at once. But this is a brand new medium we’re talking about, and it’s come a long way. The film looks impressive. Directed by Danfung Dennis, whose To Hell and Back aired on Independent Lens and was nominated for an Oscar, Melting Ice was an official selection at Sundance. (The VR short, produced by Condition One, is viewable on Google Daydream or Oculus headsets.) Learn more in this Utah Public Radio piece.
One of the most urgent films on the list. The sleeper of the Spring film festivals, as well as winner of an Audience Award in the U.S. Documentary category at Sundance, in Chasing Coral director Jeff Orlowski, a team of divers, and scientists team to take us on an ocean exploration to get to the bottom of massive reef die-off. This is not disaster porn. It’s a love letter to the endless frontier of the deep. (There’s also a VR companion to Chasing Coral as well.)
Out of the Blue
Another short VR film depicting a family of fishermen in Mexico who sacrifice their livelihood to save open ocean sea life from extinction, narrated by Dr. Sylvia Earle, “The Deepness” herself. Best known as the first marine science to use scuba equipment (known as the “Jim Suit”), Dr. Earle is the former Chief Scientist of The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). “I wish that everybody could go live underwater, if only for a day,” she once said. This VR experience is the closest some of us might get to living underwater, if only for 9 minutes. [Read more about Earle and the feature documentary about her, Mission Blue, here.]
Water & Power: A California Heist
Showing how water barons find ways to work the system to their own advantage in California’s convoluted water system and a groundwater crisis, this National Geographic film exposes centers of power in conflict with small farmers and citizens as they suffer through drought years while others profit from the scarcity.
Plastic China (2017)
Through the eyes of those who handle its waste, this delicate but moving film is a deep dive into global consumption and culture. We follow the story of a young girl by the name of Yi-Jie, working in a recycling facility and dreaming of attending school.
To the Ends of the Earth (2016)
We find ourselves in the soothing company of Ms./Dame Emma Thompson as she guides us through a journey that chronicles the rise of extreme energy, detailing the economic costs of more intensive energy production, and the people and wildlife caught in the crossfire.
Forget Shorter Showers (2015)
Based on an Orion Magazine essay with the same title, this short film by Jordan Brown and Derrick Jensen upends the idea that lifestyle changes like shorter showers and energy efficient bulbs can help mitigate climate change. Instead, it suggests that what the planet really needs is a larger seismic shift brought about by changes in economic policy.
You can watch the short in its entirety here:
[NEW] Our Planet: Now available on Netflix, this beautifully shot film is narrated by earth nature doc stalwart David Attenborough but focuses more on how climate change impacts all life. Plenty of gorgeous nature photography showcasing the wonder of our planet to bring you some comfort despite the depressing subtext.
The Future of Energy: Lateral Power to the People (2016)
The film asks how we can achieve a clean-energy society in a dubious era. Mustering the mettle of all social movements, eco-philosopher Joanna Masey fires back on that question with the age-old rejoinder “Just keep going. There is so much happening on the grassroots level.” This documentary aims to inspire the widescale adoption of renewable power. Note: It is also, alas, currently hard to track down but worth it if you can find it.
The Age of Consequences (2016)
On a darker note, these word of caution might come as a surprise from former Secretaries of State Madeleine Albright and George Schultz. Both have done work to call attention to the link between national security and climate change. These insiders make the compelling case that consequences of climate change, such as waves of refugees, failed states, terrorism, will increase by an order of magnitude unless we can reverse its effect.
Evolution of Organic (2016) and A Fierce Green Fire
Premiering at the Opening Night of San Francisco’s Green Film Festival is Mark Kitchell’s new film. Best known for his documentary Berkeley in the Sixties, Kitchell’s film Fierce Green Fire, which aired on PBS’s American Masters, gave an all-encompassing overview of the environmental movement, and the concluding chapter focused on climate change in a dire yet hopeful fashion. Kitchell’s film, which premiered at the SF Green Film Festival, tells the history of Californian organic farming.
The Islands and the Whales (2016)
A film about descendants of Norse settlers living on the Faroe Islands who have eked out a living for the over a thousand years. Mercury contamination now threatens their livelihood. This beautifully shot and moving documentary explores how pollution affects the far reaches of the planet.
The Memory of Fish (2016)
This film won Director’s Award for Cinematography at the Woods Hole Film Festival. Fisherman Dick Goin spent decades working to bring salmon back to his home turf on the Elwha River on Washington’s Olympic Peninsula after dams destroyed their habitat. This quiet documentary, narrated by actress Lili Taylor, is a commentary on the synergy between the natural world and people who embrace their total reliance on it.
The True Cost
The next generation of fashion designers voice their concerns about the tremendous waste in the rag industry in this breakthrough documentary directed by Andrew Morgan, a filmmaker focused on social change stories. Hear Morgan discuss the role of indie media in an interview on the Heritage Radio Network.
Rancher Farmer Fisherman: This documentary narrated by Tom Brokaw is based on the book by Miriam Horn, and weaves together the stories of four unlikely conservation heroes working in America’s heartland. “At a moment when it seems that collaboration is not just nonexistent but impossible, these working families cross political and other divides to arrive at real solutions for protecting the land and sea that define our country – and are crucial to all of our survival.” .

Growth of sustainable investing
Sustainable investing strategies have grown rapidly in recent years, and this trend shows no signs of slowing.
There’s no guarantee that forward-looking estimates will come to pass.
Sources: BlackRock, with data from Broadridge/Simfund, June 2018. Notes: The chart shows the total assets under management in ESG mutual funds (MFs) and ETFs globally. The 2019 to 2028 figures are based on BlackRock estimates, assuming a 5% annual growth rate in the underlying markets. Other assumptions: MF asset growth starts at 5% in 2019 and declines by 0.5% annually through 2022, then at a zeroto-0.5% rate annually thereafter. ETF asset growth starts at 45% and decreases by 5% annually through 2022, with a zero-to-3% pace thereafter.
What is driving the growth of sustainable investing?
The number of investors looking for sustainable opportunities is on the rise for several reasons:
Looking after our clients' assets for the long term
As a fiduciary investor, we work on behalf of our clients, the asset owners.
Engagement priorities
Our engagement priorities promote sound corporate governance and business practices that are consistent with sustainable long-term financial returns. We determine our engagement priorities based on our observation of market developments and emerging governance practices and evolve them year over year as necessary.
We focus on board composition, effectiveness and accountability as a top priority. In our experience, most governance issues require board leadership and oversight. We engage to better understand how boards assess their effectiveness and performance, as well as their position on director responsibilities and commitments, turnover and succession planning, crisis management, and diversity.
We expect boards to be fully engaged with management on the development and implementation of the company’s strategy. Companies should succinctly explain their long-term strategic goals, the milestones that demonstrate progress, and any obstacles anticipated or incurred.
We expect executive-pay policies to use performance measures that are closely linked to the company’s long-term strategy and goals to ensure executives are rewarded for delivering strong and sustainable returns over the long-term, as opposed to short-term hikes in share prices.
Sound practices in relation to the material environmental factors inherent to a company’s business model can be a signal of operational excellence and management quality. Environmental factors relevant to the long-term economic performance of companies are typically industry-specific, although in today’s dynamic business environment, some, such as regulation and technological change, can have a broader impact. Corporate reporting should help investors and others understand the company’s approach to these factors and how risks are integrated, and opportunities realized.
In a talent-constrained environment, we view a company’s approach to human capital management as a potential competitive advantage. We expect disclosure around a company’s approach to ensuring the adoption of the sound business practices likely to create an engaged and stable workforce.
ESG integration
There is increasing awareness that material environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors can be tied to a company’s long-term performance. As such, more and more investors are looking to integrate sustainability insights and data into their traditional investment processes. By expanding access to data and insights on material ESG risks and opportunities we can become better overall investors.
Learn more about ESG integration
Different sustainable investing styles
There is a wide range of strategies available to investors looking for dedicated sustainable investment solutions. At BlackRock, we distil client motivations into a spectrum from Avoid to Advance.
- “Avoid” strategies involve the elimination of certain companies or sectors that are associated with increased ESG risk or that violate the asset owner's values.
- “Advance” strategies focus on increasing exposure to positive ESG characteristics to align capital with certain behaviors or to target specific positive social or environmental outcomes.
Sources: BlackRock Sustainable Investing, December 2019.
Sustainable, or ESG-focused, strategies carry risks like any other investments, yet we see encouraging evidence that investors can potentially make their portfolios more sustainable without compromising on traditional financial goals.

motorship,https://www.motorship.com/news101/alternative-fuels/methanol-production-is-turning-green-and-shipping-is-taking-note ,"METHANOL PRODUCTION IS TURNING GREEN AND SHIPPING IS TAKING NOTE
Green methanol is establishing itself as a contender in the 2050 bunker fuel market, with the chemical industry motivated to go green and new production facilities and new ships raising optimism around the world.
Economics of methanol production
The pricing of sustainably produced methanol means that its uptake as a bunker fuel will likely need the social and political mandate that is already building towards 2030 and 2050 deadlines. A technology transition will also be required for greener methanol, and it will be required at scale. A recent report, Innovation Outlook: Renewable Methanol by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) and the Methanol Institute recognises this but maintains a positive outlook because of the many benefits methanol has over competing future fuels.
As a marine fuel, methanol emits no sulphur, very low particulate matter and, according to data from MAN Energy Solutions, it results in carbon dioxide emissions around 20% lower than conventional marine fuel oil. To meet IMO NOx Tier III requirements, methanol can be blended with water, negating the need for expensive exhaust gas after treatment. It is also miscible in water and readily biodegradable, characteristics that the Methanol Institute says make it ideal for use in polar waters.
“Methanol provides considerable retrofit potential as an IMO compliant bunker, being very close to a drop-in fuel for most 2 or 4-stroke marine engines. As such, some vessels may be cost effectively repurposed, extending their useful lives in the process,” says Chris Chatterton, COO of the Methanol Institute. “Methanol’s share of the marine market may be difficult to predict today, but it seems that it will steadily increase the closer we move to 2030 as experience with it as a compliant fuel is shared, pricing visibility is maintained and availability is proven up.”
The cost of producing fossil-fuel based methanol is currently in the range US$100-250, and it is already a competitive option, at least for Emission Control Areas, states the IRENA/Methanol Institute report. By 2050, the cost of bio-methanol (produced using waste biomass streams) could be US$220-560, and the cost of e-methanol (produced using green hydrogen and CO2 captured from renewable sources) could be between US$250-630 per tonne.
It’s still not clear how methanol prices will compare to key competitors such as hydrogen and ammonia, but it is likely to be cheaper to move, store and to repurpose existing infrastructure to accommodate its use as a bunker fuel. Ammonia is likely to take five to 10 years to be cost competitive and available at scale for shipping. For hydrogen, it will probably take 15 to 20 years.
Supply/demand balance
Current global demand for methanol at close to 100 Mt per year and growing. The report estimates that by 2050, there could be 135Mt of methanol produced from biomass, 250Mt produced from green hydrogen and captured CO2 and 115Mt from fossil fuels. Demand from land and marine transport will be a key driver for the production of renewable methanol due to increasing regulation of GHG emissions.
The top five methanol producing countries are China, Saudi Arabia, Trinidad and Tobago, Iran and Russia. Methanol (CH3OH) is typically produced from fossil-fuel based natural gas by reforming the gas with steam to produce syngas (hydrogen and carbon monoxide) and then converting and distilling it to produce methanol (steam methane reforming).
Less than 0.2Mt of renewable methanol is produced annually, mostly as bio-methanol. Green production alternatives include using the pyrolysis of biomass to produce the syngas, the use of electrical heating from renewable power sources for the energy-intensive reforming step or the auto-thermal reforming of methane where an extra exothermic step, typically partial oxidation, is used to generate the necessary heat to complete the reformation.
Producer BASF, for example, is now producing methanol as a biomass balanced product, replacing the fossil resources needed with biogas or bionaphtha. This means that BASF reduces greenhouse gas emissions by at least 50% compared to methanol produced from fossil raw materials.
Methanex, the world’s largest producer of methanol, is currently involved in a number of green methanol initiatives including in Iceland where the company has invested in Carbon Recycling International (CRI). CRI operates the world’s first renewable methanol plant which uses emissions-to-liquids technology, converting renewable energy and recycled CO2 emissions to renewable methanol. In Canada, Methanex produces low-carbon methanol through sequestration and injection of CO2 into the production process.
Greener production routes
A study led by the University of the West Indies evaluated the cost and sustainability of multiple different future technologies for producing methanol. The researchers found that both pyrolysis and auto-thermal reforming (ATR) were the premiere climate-smart choices for production when based on circular CO2 utilisation and storage. ATR proved to be the least energy demanding technology, mainly due to the high energy recovery from the partial oxidation that powers the reformation.
Solar-powered electrolysis was also a sustainable solution, but one that was determined to be significantly less profitable than pyrolysis. “The problem with renewables is the economies of scale issue,” says Dr Keeran Ward, study co-author. “Although the technology is getting cheaper, it can’t compare with large scale or even normal scale production capacity. For example, a 5,000 MTPD methanol plant requires about 50 tonnes/h of hydrogen while large scale electrolysis can produce 50 tonnes/day.”
He foresees a gradual transition away from cheaper, non-sustainable fossil fuel-based production, although ATR technologies are already mature enough for new projects. “And it has been shown that ATR is cheaper than steam methane reforming at large scale production capacities (5,000MTPD and higher), so logically it will be the winner.”
Methanex also considers it the most economically viable technology when there is excess hydrogen from the purge gas of its existing steam methane reforming plants. The company is developing a project in the US based on ATR.
Construction of a growing number of renewable and bio-methanol plants have been announced globally including in China, the US and numerous EU states, and for e-methanol, new production can be readily sited close to renewable power capacity, with access to both water and CO2.
This significantly broadens the potential for new production hubs. For example, in January, Germany-based energy and chemical provider Mabanaft and Chile-based Highly Innovative Fuels (HIF) announced a Memorandum of Understanding in relation to the purchase and sale of up to 500 million litres of carbon neutral e-fuels per year from HIF’s projects located within Chile including a project that will use wind power to produce hydrogen which will be combined with CO2 extracted from the atmosphere to produce methanol. The methanol will then be converted into gasoline.
Swedish energy supplier Övik Energi is providing access to one of its biofuel-based energy facilities to Sweden-based Liquid Wind so that the facility’s carbon dioxide emissions will be captured and combined with renewable hydrogen to form methanol using wind power. Once operational in 2024, the fuel facility will upcycle 70,000 tons of CO2 into 50,000 tons of carbon neutral fuel annually and make it available as a shipping fuel.
Liquid Wind’s plant will include technology from partners such as Axpo, Carbon Clean, Haldor Topsoe and Siemens Energy. Having secured crowdfunding partners in Europe, Liquid Wind is now crowdfunding in Canada, a country it says could be a prime location for e-fuel production, as it is growing in both hydrogen and carbon capture industries. Liquid Wind is planning 500 facilities by 2050, providing 25 million tons of fuel.
Haldor Topsoe has announced the construction of a facility to produce solid oxide electrolyzers (SOEC) with a total capacity of 500MW per year with the option to expand to 5GW per year. With Topsoe’s SOEC electrolyser, more than 90% of the renewable electricity that enters the electrolyser is preserved in the green hydrogen it produces, compared to around 70 % for alternatives such as PEM and alkaline electrolysis technologies. The high operating temperature of SOECs offers more favourable thermodynamics and faster kinetics, and the technology uses abundant raw materials such as nickel, zirconia, and steel.
The SOEC technology can be thermally integrated with a range of chemical synthesis processes enabling the efficient production of future fuels such as methanol and ammonia. The company says that electrolysis technologies play a central part in power-to-X solutions, and to meet the future needs for decarbonization globally, electrolysis technologies must be deployed at a massive scale.
Methanol as marine fuel
Methanol is already available in around 100 ports around the world and is being used on around 20 large ships. There is more coming, with Proman Stena Bulk expecting to take delivery of a methanol-fuelled 49,900dwt vessel in early 2022. Waterfront Shipping Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Methanex, has announced eight new methanol fuelled dual-fuel ships to be built at Hyundai Mipo Dockyard and delivered between 2021 and 2023 in partnership with Marinvest, NYK, Meiji Shipping, KSS Line and Mitsui O.S.K. Lines.
Fredrik Stubner, Director Ship Management at Marinvest Shipping, says it is difficult to predict the future economics of using bio-methanol and e-methanol. “What will the carbon taxes be? What incentives will contribute towards paying a premium for de-carbonized fuels? With stricter regulations and the cost to comply with them, it is expected it will tilt the balance in favour of greener solutions.”
He says that LNG is a cheaper fuel source, but the cryogenic technology required is expensive compared to methanol, a stable liquid at ambient temperature that is easy to store onboard. “I can’t say methanol will be a winner, but it is definitely one very good alternative. One has to keep in mind that the alternative greener fuels have less energy value, meaning larger amounts are required to meet the required cruising range for a specific vessel type and trade. So how to store the fuel whilst maintaining an equivalent cargo volume as before needs to be considered.”
A white paper from Chevron Marine Lubricants notes that a vessel would need to burn about twice as much methanol to produce the energy equivalent of MGO. This raises concern about the size of bunker tanks, but as it is biodegradable, methanol can be stored in ballast tanks in some cases. As a low flashpoint fuel, there are fuel system design requirements such as double-walled piping to the engine, but the white paper concludes that the premium for upgrading a newbuilding to be dual-fuel methanol is typically less than five percent.
Maersk's methanol-fuelled liner
A.P. Moller - Maersk is accelerating its efforts to decarbonise with the planned launch of the world’s first carbon neutral methanol-fuelled liner in 2023 - seven years ahead of its initial 2030 ambition. However, a spokesperson for the group says: “At the moment, there is no at-scale production of carbon-neutral e-methanol or sustainable bio-methanol with net-zero emissions across the lifecycle. There are a number of pilot projects and projects under development, and we are engaging with these projects so that they can advance to ensure we have carbon-neutral fuel available by the start of the feeder operation.”
One project is a partnership with Copenhagen Airports, DSV Panalpina, DFDS, SAS and Ørsted for the development of a hydrogen and e-fuel production facility in Copenhagen which could start producing hydrogen by 2023 and methanol by 2027. When fully scaled-up by 2030, the project could deliver more than 250,000 tonnes of sustainable fuel annually. Production would potentially be based on a total electrolyser capacity of 1.3 gigawatts, making it one of the world’s largest facilities of its kind, and a large-scale supply of renewable electricity could be obtained from offshore wind power produced at Rønne Banke off the island of Bornholm.
Investing in the methanol feeder is anticipated to stimulate development further. “If we – through commitment from customers – can create a real market at a reasonable price point, we believe that the combined effort and collaboration of developers, manufacturers, financers and carriers can accelerate the supply quite fast.”
For Stuart McCall, Head of Global Marine Fuel, Market Development at Methanex, it too early to tell what production volumes from new sources will be in 2050 with any degree of certainty. “All we can say at this stage is that the green methanol market, like most alternative fuels, is small but growing.”
The most important future development, he says, “is simply to encourage the shipping industry to use the dual-fuel technology we have today to start the transition to a lower-carbon economy. We can’t let perfect get in the road of good. Conventional methanol will immediately offer up to a 15% reduction in in-sector CO2 as well as complying with the strictest air emission standards in place today. Methanol dual-fuel technology is proven; it’s globally available; it's cost-competitive with conventional fuels and is lower emission. We just need regulations to encourage the use of cleaner fuels. Methanol is also future-proofed as it offers a clear pathway to 2050 decarbonization goals.”

| . The UN marks the thirty-fifth anniversary of the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant (26 April 1986) – one of the most serious nuclear accidents in history. Hundreds of thousands of people were affected by radiation. Some 350,000 people were forced to leave their homes in severely contaminated areas, with a deeply traumatic and lasting impact on their lives. The Chernobyl disaster was contained by governments working with academics and civil society for the common good. It holds important lessons for today’s efforts to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. Disaster knows no borders.

Girls around the world are using innovation and technology to solve problems, to unite communities and as a force for good and equality. And yet, women and girls are still under-represented in STEM fields. In an increasingly digitized world economy, the gender digital divide has severe repercussion for girls’ and women’s rights. To bridge this gap, at least three things need to happen: facilitate equal access to digital technologies and the internet for girls and women; encourage and invest in girls and women to build their ICT skills; and enable women and girls to take up leadership roles in tech. From creating open-source ventilators in Afghanistan to unifying and amplifying the voices of young activists in Chile, and working to end child marriage in Georgia, here are some girls and young women changemakers who inspire us.
The 2021 State of World Population report, titled My Body is My Own, marks the first time a United Nations report focuses on the power and agency of individuals to make choices about their bodies without fear, violence or coercion. The report examines data on women’s decision-making power and on laws supportive of sexual and reproductive health and rights. Tragically, only 55 per cent of women have bodily autonomy, according to measurements of their ablity to make their own decisions on issues relating to health care, contraception and whether to have sex. The report also highlights the legal, economic and social barriers to securing bodily autonomy for all. Here are seven common myths about bodily autonomy and why we must abandon these misconceptions once and for all
At a time when we face enormous challenges brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, it is heartening to see the world mobilizing as never before to tackle the looming crisis of global warming. From renewable energy to carbon markets to sustainable agriculture, countries are taking steps to address emissions and enhance resilience. But despite all the positive momentum, there is one area in particular that requires urgent action: transport. Without decarbonizing transport, no scenario for achieving the 1.5-degree climate goal is feasible, and there we are currently heading in the wrong direction. The global transport sector emits around 24 percent of the world’s total energy-related carbon emissions, and this is expected to grow by 60 percent by 2050.
The COVID-19 pandemic is a devastating reminder of the chaos caused by diseases we cannot prevent. Thanks to vaccines, we now have a way of ending this pandemic and to rebuild our lives. This World Immunization Week, join UNICEF to show #VaccinesWork.
Greta Thunberg's foundation will donate 100,000 Euros to the WHO Foundation, in support of COVAX to purchase COVID-19 vaccines, as part of the global effort to ensure equitable access of vaccines to the most at-risk in all countries.
UNESCO’s Executive Board has approved the designation of eight new UNESCO Global Geoparks, which brings the number of sites participating in the Global Geoparks Network to 169 in 44 countries. UNESCO Global Geoparks are single, unified geographical areas where sites and landscapes of international geological significance are managed with a holistic concept of protection, education and sustainable development. The newly designated UNESCO Global Geoparks are in Denmark, Finland, Germany, Greece, Indonesia, Italy and Poland.
Jordanian Omar Abu Noa’aj has struggled to find work for years due to his physical disability. Last year, an ILO employment centre helped him secure his first formal job at a garment factory, giving him a new sense of independence and purpose. A year on since his employment, Abu Noa’aj says his life has been transformed. “Before I started working, I used to see people going to work in the morning and say: ‘What a great feeling that must be.’ Now, I know what this feeling is like,” Abu Noa’aj said.
Family businesses employ 60% of the world’s workforce and contribute over 70% of global GDP. And collectively they have immense financial resources to invest in the Sustainable Development Goals. UNCTAD’s new Family Businesses for Sustainable Development initiative harnesses their potential to be a force for good and help build a transformative and sustainable future.
The COVID-19 pandemic has made us all acutely aware that human health, animal health and planetary health are inextricably linked. UN agencies have now issued guidance for national governments to help reduce public health risks associated with the sale of live wild mammals. Among other measures, the guidance calls for the suspension of sales of live wild mammals in traditional food markets that do not have effective regulations and sanitary measures.
The United Nations came into being in 1945, following the devastation of the Second World War, with one central mission: the maintenance of international peace and security. The UN does this by working to prevent conflict; helping parties in conflict make peace; peacekeeping; and creating the conditions to allow peace to hold and flourish. These activities often overlap and should reinforce one another, to be effective. The UN Security Council has the primary responsibility for international peace and security. The General Assembly and the Secretary-General play major, important, and complementary roles, along with other UN offices and bodies.
Protect Human Rights
The term “human rights” was mentioned seven times in the UN's founding Charter, making the promotion and protection of human rights a key purpose and guiding principle of the Organization. In 1948, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights brought human rights into the realm of international law. Since then, the Organization has diligently protected human rights through legal instruments and on-the-ground activities.
Deliver Humanitarian Aid
One of the purposes of the United Nations, as stated in its Charter, is ""to achieve international co-operation in solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural, or humanitarian character."" The UN first did this in the aftermath of the Second World War on the devastated continent of Europe, which it helped to rebuild. The Organization is now relied upon by the international community to coordinate humanitarian relief operations due to natural and man-made disasters in areas beyond the relief capacity of national authorities alone.
Promote Sustainable Development
From the start in 1945, one of the main priorities of the United Nations was to “achieve international co-operation in solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural, or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language, or religion.” Improving people’s well-being continues to be one of the main focuses of the UN. The global understanding of development has changed over the years, and countries now have agreed that sustainable development offers the best path forward for improving the lives of people everywhere.
Uphold International Law
The UN Charter, in its Preamble, set an objective: ""to establish conditions under which justice and respect for the obligations arising from treaties and other sources of international law can be maintained."" Ever since, the development of, and respect for international law has been a key part of the work of the Organization. This work is carried out in many ways - by courts, tribunals, multilateral treaties - and by the Security Council, which can approve peacekeeping missions, impose sanctions, or authorize the use of force when there is a threat to international peace and security, if it deems this necessary. These powers are given to it by the UN Charter, which is considered an international treaty. As such, it is an instrument of international law, and UN Member States are bound by it. The UN Charter codifies the major principles of international relations, from sovereign equality of States to the prohibition of the use of force in international relations.
The General Assembly is the main deliberative, policymaking and representative organ of the UN. All 193 Member States of the UN are represented in the General Assembly, making it the only UN body with universal representation.
The Security Council has primary responsibility, under the UN Charter, for the maintenance of international peace and security. It has 15 Members (5 permanent and 10 non-permanent members). Each Member has one vote. Under the Charter, all Member States are obligated to comply with Council decisions.
The Economic and Social Council is the principal body for coordination, policy review, policy dialogue and recommendations on economic, social and environmental issues, as well as implementation of internationally agreed development goals.
The Trusteeship Council was established in 1945 by the UN Charter, under Chapter XIII, to provide international supervision for 11 Trust Territories that had been placed under the administration of seven Member States, and ensure that adequate steps were taken to prepare the Territories for self-government and independence.
The International Court of Justice is the principal judicial organ of the United Nations. Its seat is at the Peace Palace in the Hague (Netherlands). It is the only one of the six principal organs of the United Nations not located in New York (United States of America).
The Secretariat comprises the Secretary-General and tens of thousands of international UN staff members who carry out the day-to-day work of the UN as mandated by the General Assembly and the Organization's other principal organs.
Climate change is the defining issue of our time and now is the defining moment to do something about it. There is still time to tackle climate change, but it will require an unprecedented effort from all sectors of society.
Women and girls represent half of the world’s population and, therefore, also half of its potential. Gender equality, besides being a fundamental human right, is essential to achieve peaceful societies, with full human potential and sustainable development.
While global poverty rates have been cut by more than half since 2000, one in ten people in developing regions still lives on less than US$1.90 a day — the internationally agreed poverty line, and millions of others live on slightly more than this daily amount.
The UN’s 75th anniversary in 2020 arrived at a time of great upheaval and peril. To secure a world where everyone can thrive in peace, dignity and equality on a healthy planet we need a multilateral system that is inclusive, networked and effective. ""Our Common Agenda"" will build on the 12 commitments contained in the UN75 Declaration.
As the world’s only truly universal global organization, the United Nations has become the foremost forum to address issues that transcend national boundaries and cannot be resolved by any one country acting alone.

Clearing Mines for 30 Years
“[There are] two iconic images of the 20th century: Diana walking through the minefield in body armour and then with a little girl who lost a leg to a mine. I was proud to...highlight the incredible work that's been done by deminers around the world by hosting that visit.”
In this episode of Awake at night, we meet Paul Heslop, Head of the UN Mine Action Team in Afghanistan. Paul has been clearing mines in conflict zones for nearly 30 years. He shares the remarkable progress deminers have made in removing explosive devices across the globe with Mozambique (his first post back in ‘94) declaring itself mine-free 2 years ago. Paul also recounts his time as a field officer for the Halo Trust when Princess Diana came to visit a minefield in Angola where he was working back in 1997. He recalls that epochal moment and how his quick thinking led to the non-profit gaining huge worldwide exposure through the iconic photographs of the trip.

Helping to Tackle the Spread of Zoonotic Diseases
The virus responsible for COVID-19, originating in animals, emerged in humans in late 2019 and upended the world as we know it. However, it is not the first disease to cross from animals to people. More than 60 per cent of diseases affecting humans started in animals — and with improved surveillance and animal disease control, they could be stopped. This underlines the importance of initiatives like the Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory (VETLAB) Network, providing information exchange, shared best practices and mutual support. The Network is maintained by the IAEA, in partnership with the FAO.

In war-torn Yemen, women are often the first victims
OCHA brings us the story of Halima. When the war started in Yemen five years ago, Halima’s husband lost his job. As the news became darker, so did his mood. “He started to beat me,” Halima remembers. Wearing a black headscarf and threadbare fingerless gloves, Halima sits in the Yemen Women’s Union's safe space in the town of At Turbah. Funded by the UNFPA, the Union is some 50 miles south of her home city. As she explains how she and her family fled south to a village near At Turbah, she fidgets with her wedding ring, her nails painted with deep crimson polish.

Earthworms are our ecosystem’s unsung superheroes
A WFP forest management intervention is boosting Lebanon’s green cover and helping some of its most vulnerable people put food on the table. Hidden from plain sight, an earthworm appears — an “unsung superhero”. An earthworm’s presence usually indicates soil conditions that are ideal for plant growth. WFP’s forest management interventions are boosting livelihoods and preserving Lebanon’s greenery. Designed with local authorities, such projects create common grounds for people, be they refugees or Lebanese, — this, in turn, breaks down social barriers and enhances cohesion.

At a time when we face enormous challenges brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, it is heartening to see the world mobilizing as never before to tackle the looming crisis of global warming. From renewable energy to carbon markets to sustainable agriculture, countries are taking steps to address emissions and enhance resilience. But despite all the positive momentum, there is one area in particular that requires urgent action: transport. Without decarbonizing transport, no scenario for achieving the 1.5-degree climate goal is feasible, and there we are currently heading in the wrong direction. The global transport sector emits around 24 percent of the world’s total energy-related carbon emissions, and this is expected to grow by 60 percent by 2050.
The COVID-19 pandemic is a devastating reminder of the chaos caused by diseases we cannot prevent. Thanks to vaccines, we now have a way of ending this pandemic and to rebuild our lives. This World Immunization Week, join UNICEF to show #VaccinesWork.
Greta Thunberg's foundation will donate 100,000 Euros to the WHO Foundation, in support of COVAX to purchase COVID-19 vaccines, as part of the global effort to ensure equitable access of vaccines to the most at-risk in all countries.
UNESCO’s Executive Board has approved the designation of eight new UNESCO Global Geoparks, which brings the number of sites participating in the Global Geoparks Network to 169 in 44 countries. UNESCO Global Geoparks are single, unified geographical areas where sites and landscapes of international geological significance are managed with a holistic concept of protection, education and sustainable development. The newly designated UNESCO Global Geoparks are in Denmark, Finland, Germany, Greece, Indonesia, Italy and Poland.
Jordanian Omar Abu Noa’aj has struggled to find work for years due to his physical disability. Last year, an ILO employment centre helped him secure his first formal job at a garment factory, giving him a new sense of independence and purpose. A year on since his employment, Abu Noa’aj says his life has been transformed. “Before I started working, I used to see people going to work in the morning and say: ‘What a great feeling that must be.’ Now, I know what this feeling is like,” Abu Noa’aj said.
Family businesses employ 60% of the world’s workforce and contribute over 70% of global GDP. And collectively they have immense financial resources to invest in the Sustainable Development Goals. UNCTAD’s new Family Businesses for Sustainable Development initiative harnesses their potential to be a force for good and help build a transformative and sustainable future.
The COVID-19 pandemic has made us all acutely aware that human health, animal health and planetary health are inextricably linked. UN agencies have now issued guidance for national governments to help reduce public health risks associated with the sale of live wild mammals. Among other measures, the guidance calls for the suspension of sales of live wild mammals in traditional food markets that do not have effective regulations and sanitary measures.
The United Nations came into being in 1945, following the devastation of the Second World War, with one central mission: the maintenance of international peace and security. The UN does this by working to prevent conflict; helping parties in conflict make peace; peacekeeping; and creating the conditions to allow peace to hold and flourish. These activities often overlap and should reinforce one another, to be effective. The UN Security Council has the primary responsibility for international peace and security. The General Assembly and the Secretary-General play major, important, and complementary roles, along with other UN offices and bodies.
Protect Human Rights
The term “human rights” was mentioned seven times in the UN's founding Charter, making the promotion and protection of human rights a key purpose and guiding principle of the Organization. In 1948, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights brought human rights into the realm of international law. Since then, the Organization has diligently protected human rights through legal instruments and on-the-ground activities.
Deliver Humanitarian Aid
One of the purposes of the United Nations, as stated in its Charter, is ""to achieve international co-operation in solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural, or humanitarian character."" The UN first did this in the aftermath of the Second World War on the devastated continent of Europe, which it helped to rebuild. The Organization is now relied upon by the international community to coordinate humanitarian relief operations due to natural and man-made disasters in areas beyond the relief capacity of national authorities alone.
Promote Sustainable Development
From the start in 1945, one of the main priorities of the United Nations was to “achieve international co-operation in solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural, or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language, or religion.” Improving people’s well-being continues to be one of the main focuses of the UN. The global understanding of development has changed over the years, and countries now have agreed that sustainable development offers the best path forward for improving the lives of people everywhere.
Uphold International Law
The UN Charter, in its Preamble, set an objective: ""to establish conditions under which justice and respect for the obligations arising from treaties and other sources of international law can be maintained."" Ever since, the development of, and respect for international law has been a key part of the work of the Organization. This work is carried out in many ways - by courts, tribunals, multilateral treaties - and by the Security Council, which can approve peacekeeping missions, impose sanctions, or authorize the use of force when there is a threat to international peace and security, if it deems this necessary. These powers are given to it by the UN Charter, which is considered an international treaty. As such, it is an instrument of international law, and UN Member States are bound by it. The UN Charter codifies the major principles of international relations, from sovereign equality of States to the prohibition of the use of force in international relations.
The General Assembly is the main deliberative, policymaking and representative organ of the UN. All 193 Member States of the UN are represented in the General Assembly, making it the only UN body with universal representation.
The Security Council has primary responsibility, under the UN Charter, for the maintenance of international peace and security. It has 15 Members (5 permanent and 10 non-permanent members). Each Member has one vote. Under the Charter, all Member States are obligated to comply with Council decisions.
The Economic and Social Council is the principal body for coordination, policy review, policy dialogue and recommendations on economic, social and environmental issues, as well as implementation of internationally agreed development goals.
The Trusteeship Council was established in 1945 by the UN Charter, under Chapter XIII, to provide international supervision for 11 Trust Territories that had been placed under the administration of seven Member States, and ensure that adequate steps were taken to prepare the Territories for self-government and independence.
The International Court of Justice is the principal judicial organ of the United Nations. Its seat is at the Peace Palace in the Hague (Netherlands). It is the only one of the six principal organs of the United Nations not located in New York (United States of America).
The Secretariat comprises the Secretary-General and tens of thousands of international UN staff members who carry out the day-to-day work of the UN as mandated by the General Assembly and the Organization's other principal organs.
Climate change is the defining issue of our time and now is the defining moment to do something about it. There is still time to tackle climate change, but it will require an unprecedented effort from all sectors of society.
Women and girls represent half of the world’s population and, therefore, also half of its potential. Gender equality, besides being a fundamental human right, is essential to achieve peaceful societies, with full human potential and sustainable development.
While global poverty rates have been cut by more than half since 2000, one in ten people in developing regions still lives on less than US$1.90 a day — the internationally agreed poverty line, and millions of others live on slightly more than this daily amount.
The UN’s 75th anniversary in 2020 arrived at a time of great upheaval and peril. To secure a world where everyone can thrive in peace, dignity and equality on a healthy planet we need a multilateral system that is inclusive, networked and effective. ""Our Common Agenda"" will build on the 12 commitments contained in the UN75 Declaration.
As the world’s only truly universal global organization, the United Nations has become the foremost forum to address issues that transcend national boundaries and cannot be resolved by any one country acting alone.

UN chief hears from a mother working on the pandemic’s frontlines
“In life, things wouldn’t always go as you wanted to but you have to learn how to roll with the punches,” frontline worker Peaches Dinnoo tells United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres in their one-on-one conversation about the challenges she faces raising children, working at home and coping with the COVID-19 pandemic. Ms. Dinnoo talks about how balance is the key as she raises two children in online school while also working in their shared space.

Clearing Mines for 30 Years
“[There are] two iconic images of the 20th century: Diana walking through the minefield in body armour and then with a little girl who lost a leg to a mine. I was proud to...highlight the incredible work that's been done by deminers around the world by hosting that visit.”
In this episode of Awake at night, we meet Paul Heslop, Head of the UN Mine Action Team in Afghanistan. Paul has been clearing mines in conflict zones for nearly 30 years. He shares the remarkable progress deminers have made in removing explosive devices across the globe with Mozambique (his first post back in ‘94) declaring itself mine-free 2 years ago. Paul also recounts his time as a field officer for the Halo Trust when Princess Diana came to visit a minefield in Angola where he was working back in 1997. He recalls that epochal moment and how his quick thinking led to the non-profit gaining huge worldwide exposure through the iconic photographs of the trip.

Helping to Tackle the Spread of Zoonotic Diseases
The virus responsible for COVID-19, originating in animals, emerged in humans in late 2019 and upended the world as we know it. However, it is not the first disease to cross from animals to people. More than 60 per cent of diseases affecting humans started in animals — and with improved surveillance and animal disease control, they could be stopped. This underlines the importance of initiatives like the Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory (VETLAB) Network, providing information exchange, shared best practices and mutual support. The Network is maintained by the IAEA, in partnership with the FAO.

In war-torn Yemen, women are often the first victims
OCHA brings us the story of Halima. When the war started in Yemen five years ago, Halima’s husband lost his job. As the news became darker, so did his mood. “He started to beat me,” Halima remembers. Wearing a black headscarf and threadbare fingerless gloves, Halima sits in the Yemen Women’s Union's safe space in the town of At Turbah. Funded by the UNFPA, the Union is some 50 miles south of her home city. As she explains how she and her family fled south to a village near At Turbah, she fidgets with her wedding ring, her nails painted with deep crimson polish.

Earthworms are our ecosystem’s unsung superheroes
A WFP forest management intervention is boosting Lebanon’s green cover and helping some of its most vulnerable people put food on the table. Hidden from plain sight, an earthworm appears — an “unsung superhero”. An earthworm’s presence usually indicates soil conditions that are ideal for plant growth. WFP’s forest management interventions are boosting livelihoods and preserving Lebanon’s greenery. Designed with local authorities, such projects create common grounds for people, be they refugees or Lebanese, — this, in turn, breaks down social barriers and enhances cohesion.

spiraxsarco,https://www.spiraxsarco.com/global/en-GB/news/delivering-energy-efficiency-with-sustainable-steam ,"In today’s increasingly environmentally-conscious world, we’re all looking to become more sustainable; whether that’s by switching to a reusable coffee cup or paper straws. But, scale up these eco-conscious efforts to a district heating scheme and you could be faced with some pretty unique challenges.
One town in Scotland was faced with this very dilemma when they looked at introducing a sustainable, energy-efficient means of fueling two hundred homes. The town introduced a 3.5MW biomass boiler, feed tank, turbine and load-leveling vessel in the existing energy centre – all of which would provide heat and energy for the plant.
You might think the job was complete at this stage; after all, biomass is now providing a renewable energy source at a relatively low-cost for the town. But, the energy company responsible for the town’s utilities saw an opportunity to introduce a local distillery into the district heating scheme.
For this, they needed some help. Spirax Sarco was brought in to assist with the design and specification of energy-saving steam technology for the newly-developed plant. Our role was to help by making sure that the new system used as much available energy as possible. Why? To ensure the biomass system would be able to meet everyone’s needs – the residents, the distillery’s and the needs of local business.
Spirax Sarco created a full design specification with drawings and accompanying stress analysis report that recommended the use of a 20-bar g steam system that incorporated a second load-levelling vessel with level, steam and condensate control systems, steam surplus pressure reduction systems, double-block and bleed isolation valves, steam ancillaries and a pressure reduction station for the steam turbine.
In order to cut waste and utilise all of the available energy, the Distillery is supplied with steam for process and the district heating system is supplied with hot water from steam to water and water to water heat exchange packaged systems.
The benefits to the distillery come in the form of a low-carbon, energy-efficient way of heating the fermented wash, because both the sensible and latent heat dissipate into the liquid. Pretty amazing right? The benefits to the distillery don’t stop there, the condensate return system recycles the collected condensate from the process to provide hot water, making it even more of a sustainable choice!
Investing in sustainability doesn’t just have to mean ditching the plastic shopping bag and buying an electric car. This Scottish town is now benefiting from sustainably-sourced heat and power via its heating network, meaning all 200 homes are positively contributing to the UK’s carbon reduction efforts.
You don’t need to distill whisky or live in the Highlands to benefit from sustainable steam. The rise of district heating schemes that deliver cost-effective, low-carbon heat across the UK are testament to the role steam can play in the future decarbonisation of the energy grid.
Martin Kent
Project Sales Support Manager
When you think of steam systems, you may be inclined to think of the food and beverage or pharmaceutical industries. What you may be less inclined to think of, is the UK car industry.
If you’re a frequent reader of this blog, you’ll have no doubt realised by now that I am – like many of my colleagues – passionate about the positive impact clean steam can make in the food and beverage sector.

Special Issue Information
Dear Colleagues,
Based on a materials stock and flow principle, the field of Industrial Ecology systematically analyzes interactions between human/industrial activities and the environment, in order to move towards practices that are sustainable in the long-term. The emphasis is on society’s resource use and resource efficiency at multiple scales. The concept of “social metabolism"" and its accounting framework, Material and Energy Flows Analysis (MEFA), have made considerable advancements in the ability to measure resource throughput for understanding long-term trends in national and global resource use, decoupling, and circular economy.
Islands are excellent focal points for studies of Industrial Ecology. Not only does the clear boundary of islands simplify tracking resource flows, but the limited resource availability and carrying capacity of small islands warrant better tracking and management of these inputs and outputs. The challenge of resource security on small islands is further aggravated by the global environmental change. Sea level rise and extreme weather events result not only in infrastructure losses but also in the immediate loss of critical services. Restoring the services provided by these stocks comes with large material requirements for reconstruction, oftentimes incurring huge debts.
This Special Issue invites contributions that look at material stocks and flows on small island states (SIS) and sub-national island jurisdictions (SNIJ), how such insights can support island societies to move towards more sustainable and resilient modes of production, consumption and infrastructure development. The special issue will also consider compelling contributions related to island sustainability in general.

“Our goal is to integrate ESG best practices into our business strategy; in doing so we bolster a sustainable business model that does right by our associates, clients and shareholders.”
The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity by 2030. At Broadridge, we understand these challenges and align with these goals. We have identified four primary SDGs where we strive to make our greatest contributions.
SDG #4 works to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promotes lifelong learning opportunities for all.
We closely align with goal 4, target 4.3 to “ensure equal access for all women and men to affordable and quality technical, vocational and tertiary education, including university.” We also align with goal 4, target 4.5 to “eliminate gender disparities in education and ensure equal access to all levels of education and vocational training for the vulnerable, including persons with disabilities, indigenous peoples and children in vulnerable situations.”
Quality education has always been and will continue to be a key part of who we are. By financing the educational advancement of our associates, donating resources to charitable causes, and volunteering our time to tutoring students, we promote equal access to quality education for all people. Through our associate benefits programs and community philanthropy and volunteer efforts, we sponsor college scholarships for the children of our associates and offer tuition reimbursement for full-time employees.

Read more about our commitment to having a positive social and environmental impact in our 2020 Sustainability Report.
IWC Schaffhausen manages social and environmental impacts through the oversight of our Sustainability Committee.
This Committee is made up of representatives who are responsible for every aspect of IWC’s business.
Together, IWC’s CEO and Sustainability Committee set the organization’s sustainability targets and activities. Every two years, the Committee provides a detailed review of its work, in IWC’s Sustainability Report.
What we aim for
Targets provide a measurable roadmap for our actions. We work to a two-year cycle, while also recognizing that ensuring a positive social and environmental impact is a long-term undertaking.
Our 2022 targets are:
Double the share of women in management positions compared to a 2017 baseline
RJC Chain of Custody certification of watch components
Purchase 100 per cent renewable energy globally
Develop and implement a Green IT strategy
Phase out purchase of non-FSC (Forest Stewardship Council)-certified forestry products
Develop and pilot a blueprint for sustainable events
Maintain “Great Place to Work” certification
Achieve Equal Pay certification
Double IWC's annual corporate volunteering hours compared to a 2020 baseline
IWC operates in Switzerland, a country with high standards of environmental protection, social justice, and compliance with laws and regulations. It is through sourcing that IWC is most at risk of contributing to a negative impact. IWC manages this risk by maintaining strong relationships with trusted suppliers, and working to establish traceability throughout the supply chain.
Supply chain
The majority of IWC’s suppliers are based in Switzerland or elsewhere in Europe. IWC’s supply chain managers regularly meet with suppliers, alternately in Schaffhausen and at suppliers’ premises. Trusted relationships are vital to our supply chain management. Our Supplier Code of Conduct and Supply Chain policy can be accessed through the Due Diligence Report, further below.
Responsible Jewellery Council
The Responsible Jewellery Council (RJC) is a non-profit industry association for the watch and jewellery sector. By purchasing gold, platinum group metals (PGM) and diamonds only from RJC-certified suppliers, IWC can be assured of not sourcing products tainted by conflict, human rights abuses, child labour, or significant environmental damage. IWC has been an RJC member since 2014, and in 2020 became the first luxury watch brand to be audited to the RJC’s stringent 2019 COP standard. In 2021, IWC attained RJC’s Chain of Custody certification, and once more is the first luxury watch brand to do so. This certification attests the documented, traceable flow of precious metals.
Innovation
Developing new materials is part of IWC’s brand heritage. Research into new materials for watch straps is currently ongoing, with a life cycle assessment approach being adopted as far as possible. This means evaluating environmental and social impacts at every stage of a material’s lifespan to ensure that solving a problem in one area doesn’t create an adverse impact in another.
At IWC Schaffhausen we work to manage the environmental impact not only of our own operations, but also of our sourcing decisions, community investment, and the choices made in our role as an employer. Increasingly, environmental impact is also factored into planning marketing and events, client experience opportunities, and sponsorships. See our 2020 Sustainability Report for detailed information about our environment impact.
Packaging
In 2018, we redesigned our watch boxes to meet our 2020 target “reduce the average volume and weight of primary packaging by 30 percent compared to 2017”. By designing smaller, higher quality packaging with customer needs in mind, IWC has created a new long-lasting product and shown that ‘luxury’ does not have to mean ‘excess.’ The new boxes contain 90% less plastic than previously, and 80% of the plastic remaining is recycled plastic. We aim to increase this figure to 100% in future.
Fighting deforestation
Forests play a critical role in maintaining the health of our planet. To avoid contributing to the social and environmental harm caused by illegal logging and deforestation, IWC aims to source only FSC (Forest Stewardship Council)-certified forestry products. In 2018, we changed our logo on our shopping bags from silver to black, so that the bags could be recycled by customers after use – these bags are also made from FSC-certified, 100% post-consumer waste.
Marketing and events
IWC has developed sustainable events guidelines to enable marketing and events that have a more positive social and environmental impact. We increasingly strive to ensure materials are reused, either by sourcing items via rental, and impacts of events will increasingly be monitored, measured and addressed.
Green I.T.
I.T. generates a vast and growing proportion of global greenhouse gas emissions, and we all can improve our environmental impact via our I.T. choices. Ensuring I.T. choices benefit or minimize harm to the environment is ‘Green I.T.’ By 2022, IWC will be implementing a Green I.T. strategy.
IWC recognizes that its choices as an employer provide the chance to have a positive impact on the environment, and local communities. In 2019, IWC became the first luxury watchmaker to be awarded “Great Place to Work” ™ certification in Switzerland, demonstrating high levels of engagement and the creation of a culture of trust.
Working at IWC Schaffhausen
IWC aims to create an ideal workplace. Employees’ well-being, health, training and development, and safety are supported at every level of the company. Read more in our 2020 Sustainability Report, including stories from employees with ties to IWC that go back generations.
Diversity and Inclusion
Recognizing that good intentions alone aren’t enough to bring meaningful change, IWC is implementing a structured long-term program to increase all aspects of diversity and inclusion in our organization. Read more in our 2020 Sustainability Report, and watch this space for updates on our progress.
IWC aims to have a positive social and environmental impact by investing in communities locally and globally. We do this through direct support of partner organizations, building on our long-standing relationships, as well as through our corporate volunteering activities, and by sponsoring a variety of initiatives in our hometown, Schaffhausen.
Corporate Volunteering
We encourage all of our employees to take part in corporate volunteering. Globally, we encourage employees to volunteer with Be My Eyes, and in Schaffhausen, we organize “Forest Days” with the Forest Stewardship Council. Our colleagues around the world also organize their own local volunteering initiatives.
IWC’s social and environmental impact commitments
Through Richemont Group, IWC is a member of the Swiss Better Gold Association, as well as the Global Compact Network Switzerland, an association of Swiss companies implementing and working to strengthen acceptance of the UN’s ten Global Compact Principles. In addition to supporting these ten principles, IWC recognizes the importance of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, a blueprint for a better future, and aligns in particular to SDGs 5, 8, 12 and 13. IWC also directly supports organizations working to achieve UN SDGs 4, 14 and 15.

The UN Sustainable Development Goals
In September 2015, the member states of the United Nations adopted the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). They serve as a blueprint for what the global community wants to achieve by the end of this decade to ensure a better future for all. Consisting of 17 goals and 169 specific social, environmental and economic targets, they set the agenda for a sustainable tomorrow.
Like sustainability itself, we see the SDGs not just as a framework to set the right ambitions, but as a chance to unleash innovation and growth. With our innovative products, sustainable operations and commitment to valuing people, we are dedicated to making contributions to the UN SDGs.

gartner,https://www.gartner.com/en/supply-chain/insights/supply-chain-sustainability https://www.gartner.com/en/marketing/insights/daily-insights/what-is-the-future-of-sustainable-fashion ,"Supply chain sustainability delivers business value: It reduces costs, spurs productivity and in some cases drives returns. There are also regulatory and compliance reasons to focus on supply chain sustainability. The supply chain organization is well-positioned to help the enterprise balance its profitability and purpose goals as it shifts to supply chain sustainability. The CSCO then must be ready to advise his or her C-suite colleagues, the board and investor relations leaders on how supply chain sustainability addresses ESG risks (environmental, social, governance) and drives competitive advantage.
But 30% of supply chain leaders today say they have no or low-maturity supply chain sustainability initiatives. Common obstacles to supply chain sustainability include limited resources, conflicting priorities, lack of understanding of sustainability concepts and low visibility on early wins. . Fashion brands are embracing unique ways to create more sustainable products.
Premium and value fashion brands are developing new ways to create clothing out of recycled products in an effort to reduce waste. While buying vintage or used clothing has been on the rise, designers are working to develop practices that create less or no waste using materials from fresh ingredients or recycled goods. For example, Vin + Omi, a British design team that’s dressed former first lady Michelle Obama, has been harvesting its own crops for clothing from horseradish plants and chestnuts. The brands’ latest clothing collection includes items made from recycled paint containers—all in an effort to make products more sustainable. Other designers have begun using items such as old refrigerators and waste from the sea, with the hope that in the near future the fashion industry will be able to use fiber-to-fiber recycling—where a piece of clothing is unraveled and turned into a new piece of clothing.
It is not only luxury fashion brands that are making public efforts to end fashion waste. The notably Earth-conscious brand Patagonia created a 100% recycled polyester fleece sweater. The fibers in the sweater are made from recycled soda bottles, waste, and other former clothing fibers. Synthetic polyester is one of the most harmful materials for the environment, though it is also the most widely used synthetic fiber. The fleece sweater retails for $119, an average price for a Patagonia sweater—demonstrating that sustainable products can be created at no extra cost to the consumer. Patagonia’s sustainable clothing is in addition to the brands upcycling resale marketplace, Worn Wear, that lets customers trade in worn brand clothing for store credit according to a Gartner report.
Sustainable fashion has a long way to go, but the industry is beginning to make strides as more brands and customers embrace environmentally friendly products and shopping habits. Brands hoping to create recycled goods can look to companies like Vin + Omi or Patagonia for ideas on going green in fashion. .

bruichladdich,https://www.bruichladdich.com/philosophy/sustainability/ ,"WMD – THE STORY OF THE YELLOW SUBMARINE HAS BEEN FULL OF CHARACTER AND CHARACTERS RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING.
It started with our friend ‘Demolition Dave’ helping Duncan McGillivray and his gang to demolish the old Inverleven distillery – buying up all the old equipment for scrap and loading it onto barges on the Clyde. All so Duncan had some spares to keep Bruichladdich running in the days of No Money.
As this odd flotilla was being towed round the Mull of Kintyre and up to Islay, Laddie MD Mark Reynier received an email from the Defence Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) in the USA who had been monitoring distillery webcams on the grounds that our processes could have been ‘tweaked’ to produce the dreaded WMD. ‘Weapons of Mass Destruction’.
Never one to allow the opportunity for a good story to pass him by, or to get his beloved distillery in the news, Reynier embellished the tale, which soon grew to involve spies and the CIA and visits by weapons inspectors. All of which made great headline-grabbing copy in the febrile media atmosphere then prevailing around WMD.
One of the stills from Inverleven was dutifully set up outside the old Victorian buildings, and became an iconic sight, with a pair of Duncan’s old wellie boots sticking out of the top to represent those weapons inspectors searching for dangerous chemicals deep in its copper bottomed interior.
A special bottling was commissioned (of course) and dubbed the ‘Whisky of Mass Distinction’ (geddit?) and much hilarity ensued. At least among the Laddies, the rest of the whisky industry having long since given up on the noisily irreverent rebels.
WMDII: A YELLOW SUBMARINE
Things were about to get even more eccentric because, shortly afterwards, Islay fisherman John Baker was heading home to Port Ellen when he spotted something awash in the sea off the bow of his boat. Being a resourceful man, he attached a rope to said object and towed it into the pier where Gordon Currie lifted it out of the water. It proved to be a very beautiful yellow submarine.
Very conveniently, the yellow vessel had ‘Ministry of Defence’ and a telephone number stencilled on it, which was of course immediately called. What happened next was to become the stuff of legend. He was connected to the Royal Navy. “I have found your yellow submarine” said John. “We haven’t lost a yellow submarine” said the Navy. Which was an odd response as the evidence to the contrary was overwhelming.
John and Gordon then loaded the submarine onto a lorry and took it to a secret location in Port Ellen (actually fellow fisherman Harold Hastie’s back garden). The local newspaper was called, then the nationals, and the following day the red-tops were full of pictures of the two friends astride the lethal-looking machine, carrying fishing rods, and asking: “Has anybody lost a yellow submarine?”
Hilarious… unless you were the Royal Navy – who did eventually admit to it being theirs. HMS Blyth, the minesweeper that lost it, eventually came to pick it up, slipping into the pier at dawn to winch it aboard. By that time, Bruichladdich had (of course) commissioned another bottling, WMD2: The Yellow Submarine, and a box of lovely liquid was graciously offered, and accepted by the captain as a goodwill gesture. .

proposalsforngos,https://proposalsforngos.com/sustainability-plan-project-proposal/ https://proposalsforngos.com/what-is-project-sustainability/ ,"Sustainability has become a buzzword in the field of philanthropy. More and more donors and organizations put a lot of emphasis on this topic. When talking about sustainability in general, most people only think of environmental sustainability. This concept deals with environmental issues like climate change, depletion of soils, air pollution, etc. In most calls for proposals, the donor asks for a sustainability plan though that entails much more and is focused on the sustainability of the project itself. Many NGOs see this more as an afterthought than a prime concern, but the sustainability plan is actually very important.
Learn everything you need to know about it in this article and use it to your advantage in your next project proposal.
What is the sustainability plan?
The sustainability plan is basically a document, that describes how your project will be sustained in the long term. This document focuses on community sustainability, financial sustainability, and organizational sustainability. The sustainability plan has become more and more important because donors would like to fund projects that have the potential to survive and thrive in the long term. The sustainability plan describes the different aspects in which the project has to be sustained in the long run to still function.
The sustainability plan spells out how your project will survive in the long term. It makes sure that resources spent on the project are not lost. It gives you and the donor reassurance that the grant is well spent and will have a long-lasting impact, even once the support runs out.
Why do I need a sustainability plan?
Most donors require at least a paragraph in your proposal to be about the sustainability of your project. Some want you to write a full sustainability plan. But why do they want you to focus a lot of time on spelling out the sustainability of your project? Actually, when a donor decides to fund you, they invest in your project. Like with every investment, the donors want the money they spend to go a long way – and to have a lasting impact. They do not want your project to end after their support but want to spark sustainable change which has a long-term effect.
When you develop a thorough sustainability plan that makes sense and has all the important information, you show the donor that you think about the success of your project in the long term. It can convince the donor, that you are the absolute expert in the field you are working on and that you know what you are doing. It also shows the donor, that you truly have the best for the beneficiaries in mind, as you think about how the project will be sustained after the short-term financial support runs out.
But even if it is not required, it makes a lot of sense to think about the sustainability of the project and your organization and write a plan for this. This way, it becomes much clearer for everybody, what the long-term perspective for the project is and where you want to go with your project. Writing down a plan for the sustainability of your project will help you to become clearer on what you have to do and what the timeline for actions would be.
Many NGOs don’t put enough attention to writing the sustainability plan, as it is often the last part of a proposal. This leaves this section with a lot of potentials for you to stand out. When your sustainability plan is great, it can be the section that distinguishes your proposal from your competition and convinces the donor to actually fund your project.
What are the parts of a sustainability plan?
The sustainability plan normally has three parts. Like mentioned earlier, the sustainability plan does not necessarily refer to the environmental sustainability of the project – even though it is very important that you address this issue somewhere in your proposal. In the sustainability plan, you should focus only on the sustainability of your project itself. The three parts that you should address are the community sustainability, financial sustainability, and organizational sustainability of your project.
When describing project sustainability, many NGOs focus mostly on financial sustainability. Of course, this is an important part of the project sustainability, but it is not necessarily the most important part. While it is important to know how the project will be financed in the long term, the other parts of the sustainability plan are also very important. Without community and organizational sustainability, financial sustainability will not directly result in project sustainability.
What is community sustainability?
Community sustainability addresses the issue of how well the project is rooted in the community. It also describes how the community will continue with the project, once there is no more financial support from the donor. This part has been recognized as very important in the last decades, as it became more and more clear that without the support of the community, many projects have no chance of survival. If the community does not feel ownership of the project, even with a well-thought-out financing strategy, the project will probably fail.
A good way to ensure community sustainability is to include beneficiaries from the get-go in planning and implementation. Participatory methods can be very helpful for this. Consult with all stakeholders whenever possible to make sure that the community feels ownership for the project and that their preferences are implemented with your project.
What is financial sustainability?
Financial sustainability describes the ability of your project to survive financially. Here, you have to state what kind of funding sources you have for the future to make sure, the project can sustain its financial needs. Basically, you have two options to do this: rely on external sources or internal sources.
External sources of financing mean that the money comes from outside of the organization and is not raised by project activities. This could be more grants, government funding, donations, etc. When this is your plan, make sure to be as precise as possible, because if you only tell the donor that you will apply for more grants after the project finishes, you do not actually give them a lot of information.
Internal sources of financing mean that you have a plan to raise the money within the organization or through revenue-creating activities. This could be business ventures, membership fees, and other income-generating activities. It is important that you nevertheless have a good strategy in place from the first stages, as i.e. a social enterprise component needs to be smartly embedded in your project and cannot be added by the end.
Of course, your section about financial sustainability will look very different depending on the kind of project you want to implement. If you apply for a one-off project that will likely have almost no follow-up cost, you need to put much less thought into it than if you have a project that will have reoccurring costs that need to be covered in the long run.
What is organizational sustainability?
Organizational sustainability describes the ability of your organization as a whole to survive. The donors want to establish a long-lasting partnership, so they want to know if your organization will still be there in 10 years. This can also be achieved through external sources like grants and long-term funding or through internal sources like income-generating activities or membership fees. This section of the sustainability plan should not be neglected, as it is important to show the donor that you are a great partner that they can reckon with in the future.
The Sustainability Plan – How to Score with Donors (Webinar)
How to develop a sustainability plan?
Like we said above, normally the sustainability plan is one of the last sections in the proposal. Many fundraisers make the mistake of only thinking of it in these last stages of the proposal writing process. But if you have paid close attention earlier when we described the different kinds of sustainability, you will already have noticed that the sustainability plan does not only influence this section but the entire proposal. If you want to have strong community sustainability, you will need to design your approach in a way that fosters participation. If you want to ensure financial sustainability through the establishment of a social enterprise, your activities need to reflect that. Therefore, the sustainability plan is something that should be on your mind throughout the entire proposal writing process and something that you should have determined right in the beginning.
Make sure that your entire team is on board when you discuss your vision of a sustainability plan. It will influence many areas of your organization and your project, and everybody needs to know what the long-term strategy is to be able to implement it in a strategic way. Try to approach every aspect of your project planning with the question of how this is going to run in the long term and write these ideas down to develop your sustainability plan.
What makes for a successful sustainability plan?
So now you know what a sustainability plan is, why you need one, and how you can develop one.
But what makes for a successful sustainability plan?What should you look out for to write a good one?
There is actually quite some research out there, and according to studies, these are the most important factors that can influence project sustainability:
Having a coherent mission/theory of change for the organization
A good monitoring and evaluation system
The adaptability of the approach
Staff training in administrative tasks
Having multiple sources of funding
The organizational stability
Integration into existing systems and political support
Community support
Knowing this, you should try to keep these factors in mind and address them as detailed as possible in your sustainability plan. As many NGOs still neglect this section of the proposal, you have a great chance to shine here and make your proposal the special one that will ultimately win the grant!

Before that, she worked in South America and Europe with different organizations. She holds a Ph.D. in geography and her field of research was sustainability and inclusion in development projects. . Sustainability is the ability of an organization to continue its mission or program far into the future. All projects have to end eventually, but the project impact should continue. Donors want to see how the project and its impact will outlive their direct involvement in the project.
A project or organization can be sustainable in three main categories: organizational, financial, and community sustainability.
Community
Community sustainability is how the community carries out the project activities even after the NGO leaves.
Example: The project trains 50 new mothers on infant nutrition. After the training, these mothers will then share their knowledge with other mothers, children, and neighbors in their communities. In this way, the project will continue to reach an additional 200-500 indirect beneficiaries one year after official project activities are completed.
Financial
Financial sustainability is how the financial support required for the project or the organization will continue after the grant has ended.
Example: As part of the advocacy initiative, the Communications Team will organize an online newsletter and crowd-sourcing campaign. This campaign will also include an annual appeal to further support the project.
Organizational
Organizational sustainability is how the NGO itself continues to function after the project.
Example: The program will us social media to publicize its research findings, and also help attract new volunteers to the organization.
Other Types of Sustainability
NGOs and projects come in all shapes and sizes. Thus, NGOs can be sustainable in many other areas beyond community, financial, and organizational sustainability. For certain types of NGOs, this can also include:
- Business sustainability: the project will generate financial gains or profits and continue to function on earned income. This may also be a cross-cutting theme in livelihood development-type projects.
- Environmental sustainability: the project uses resources in such a way that the needed resources will never disappear. This is only in rare cases a type of project sustainability. More often, environmental sustainability is a project theme or cross-cutting theme.
Regardless of the category, make it clear to the donor how the project impact will be sustained even after the grant is completed. . ",False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False

We strive to create a positive impact for our people, our business and our planet, while supporting our customers’ growth and sustainability goals through our product offerings.
Unifi is proud to present our inaugural sustainability report. Thank you for being a part of this journey.
Pac-12 Team Green
Leveraging the Power of Sports
Sustainability thrives on passion and sports fan have plenty of it. That’s why the Pac-12 Team Green is a formidable partner in advancing sustainability across universities through the Pac-12 Conference of Champions. We join forces on circular economy initiatives, like bottle take back programs, and Team Green uses REPREVE in fan gear and in graduation apparel.
Champions of Sustainability
20 Billion Reasons to Celebrate
At Unifi, we transform recycled plastic bottles into REPREVE® recycled performance fiber, sharing our passion for sustainability with other forward-thinking companies and brands. To celebrate recycling 20 billion plastic bottles, we recognize forward-thinking brand partners who helped us reach this important milestone. We couldn’t have done it without them.
All-In to Win
Kathmandu Puts Sustainability First
Kathmandu has diverted more than 13 million plastic bottles from landfills with their innovative designs. By incorporating REPREVE in each design, Kathmandu received the Champions of Sustainability award for being All-In.
REPREVE
Leading Recycled Solution
We hate landfills as much as anybody. But we’re not just keeping our world from being overwhelmed with plastic bottles. Did you know… making REPREVE recycled fiber also offsets using new petroleum, emitting fewer greenhouse gases and conserving water and energy in the process? That makes a big difference for everybody.
Our Larger Responsibility
We serve our planet and its people.
That means that we protect human rights wherever we operate. It's not just about product or process. It's about being totally committed to doing what's right—including giving back. To our communities. And to organizations that help take care of our planet for future generations.
So obsessed with transparency, we’re certifiable.
We've been entrusted with a great responsibility, so trust is paramount. When a reliable system for verifying customers’ recycled claims didn’t exist, Unifi set a new standard with its U TRUST® verification system. Our hope and our promise is to do the right things, in the right ways. And to be as transparent as we can be.
Reducing our company's long-term footprint.
In our facilities worldwide, we actively seek to eliminate waste and conserve resources, especially with energy, labor, packaging and transportation.

globaldata,https://store.globaldata.com/report/gdtmt-tr-s246--sustainability-thematic-research/ ,"Sustainability used to be just about saving the planet. Today it has morphed into an umbrella term for environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues. While some companies are making concerted efforts to improve their ESG performance across many areas, others are simply paying lip service to the concept of sustainable profits. Momentum is on the side of the sustainability movement. Citizens, governments, regulators, and the media are turning the spotlight on corporations and demanding action. Social inequality, corruption, tax avoidance, and a lack of action on climate change are all issues that companies must now address head-on, in full public view.
The reluctance of many CEOs to fully engage with sustainability can be attributed to the age-old view that it will hurt profits. However, the evidence in this report suggests the opposite. Companies that embrace all three elements of sustainability will outperform their peers. CEOs that are too slow to improve their company’s approach to sustainability will see an exodus of customers and a drop in profits far sooner than they ever imagined.
Sustainability is a complex and wide-ranging subject and is often approached in a piecemeal, reactive manner. There are no global standards for sustainability, so it can be difficult for CEOs to know where to start. In this report, we set out a comprehensive sustainability framework – based on environmental, social and governance issues – to help CEOs identify all potential sustainability risks and implement mitigating actions that can improve their company’s ESG performance. Because no company can do this in isolation, we highlight some of the leading ESG rating agencies and ESG consultancies that can help CEOs measure and improve their ESG performance.
This report provides an overview of sustainability, the most important theme for 2020.
This report includes a comprehensive sustainability framework, covering environment, social and governance (ESG) factors, which can be used as a management tool to help CEOs identify all potential sustainability risks and implement mitigating actions that can improve their company’s ESG performance.
It highlights some of the leading ESG rating agencies and ESG consultancies that can help CEOs measure and improve their ESG performance.
Additionally, we highlight how some of the world’s largest companies across every major industry vertical including healthcare, TMT, retail and financial services are rated on ESG performance by four leading ESG rating agencies.
While some companies are making concerted efforts to improve their ESG performance across many areas, others are simply paying lip service to the concept of sustainable profits.
Citizens, governments, regulators, and the media are turning the spotlight on corporations and demanding action. Social inequality, corruption, tax avoidance, and a lack of action on climate change are all issues that companies must now address head-on, in full public view.
The financial crisis of 2007 cast a shadow over the free market doctrine that had previously governed the corporate world. The public began to question profiteering by big business and put pressure on regulators to tighten controls. At the same time, the consequences of climate change have become more apparent, leading many to demand companies are more transparent about their environmental impact.
As ‘Generating Hashtag’ rises through the ranks of the global workforce, they will approach business decisions with a more sustainable mindset. As consumers, they will be attracted to more sustainable products.
In 2020, sustainability will be the most important theme discussed in corporate boardrooms worldwide.
Over the coming decade, it will transform the way that business is conducted. Customers, voters, and politicians will demand greater action is taken on environmental, social, and governance issues.
CEOs and upper management should utilize the ESG framework in this report to identify the impact of ESG issues on their business and the actions they should take to mitigate this.
Companies that take sustainability seriously now will be better placed to succeed in the future.

diabgroup,https://www.diabgroup.com/sustainability/ ,"In a world shared by 7.3 billion people, sustainability is not optional – it is essential. Each one of us has a responsibility to our planet and the future generations who will inhabit it.
We need to use resources efficiently, improve social and working conditions, protect natural ecosystems, raise aspirations and extend opportunities for all.
We need to continuously improve our business performance and by that the natural world as we live, create and build. The race toward zero carbon is driven by countries and companies around the world as ESG* investors increasingly require lower carbon footprint throughout the supply chain.
* Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria are a group of standards used by socially conscious investors to screen investments.
Sandwich core composite materials benefit the environment in many ways. Due to their low-density properties the cores themselves require only a small amount of raw material. When applied, sandwich solutions enable lightweight, flexible and aerodynamic designs that reduce the fuel consumption of vehicles and vessels and open for creative design opportunities.
Looking at the overall life cycle, our products also compensate for their carbon footprint in many applications thanks to the extremely long life for which they were designed.
At Diab we understand that our products and solutions are a natural part of the future society. We provide a wide range of sandwich core materials to fit different applications. The right core decreases cost and carbon footprint throughout the application’s life cycle. As a concrete example, sandwich composites are a driver of the competitiveness of wind energy. The lightweight materials that we provide enable efficient rotor blade design that lowers the production cost of electricity generated, which makes renewable energy from wind more competitive.
Diab continues growing, and the larger and more global our company becomes, the greater our responsibility. We believe we need to make a difference on the big issues that matter to us all. That is why we have made Sustainability one of our top business priorities. A lot remains to be done, but we are determined to continue improving our performance, putting sustainability principles and ideas into practice.
We aim to be the market leader in PET foam core, which includes having the lowest carbon footprint, and to be the best partner for customers that are committed to reducing their carbon footprint and improve circularity.
As a part of our endeavor, we are following global initiatives:
As the first company within the field of composite materials in the world, Diab has an approved CO₂-reduction plan in accordance with the Science Based Targets Initiative requirements. Our very clear set target in our SBTs is completely in line with SDG number 13 - Climate Action.

We feel a responsibility to make the world, the people and the environment around us feel as good as possible in a short and long term perspective. That is why we work to integrate sustainability into every part of our business - all the way home to you as a customer. Read more about our sustainability work here.
We have high goals for our sustainability work, so we have selected three of the UN's sustainability goals that we believe we can have the greatest impact on:
- Good health and wellbeing
- Sustainable consumption and production
- Fighting climate change
In each area, we have chosen topics that we will focus extra on and constantly strive to get better in each area.
Good Health and Well-being
Diversity and Intergration – Skin care and good skin health are for everyone and our goal is for everyone to feel welcome and included in everything we do.
Sustainable Working Life and Well-being – Working at Skincity must also be sustainable! As an employer, Skincity will provide its employees with flexibility, time for recovery, personal development and investment in the individual's physical and mental health. This is to create good conditions for increased overall quality of life, loyalty and long-term commitment.
Give Back – Skin care has a strong impact on emotional and mental well-being and as reliable experts we are confident that we can help people improve their skin health through guidance. We will support selected initiatives - large and small - in line with our mission to increase overall well-being through better skin health.
Sustainble Consumption and Production
Conscious Purchasing – In our effort to reduce our environmental footprint, we will set specific requirements for our suppliers and we will continuously search for more sustainable alternatives where needed.
Sustainable Consumption – We believe that there is a sustainable skin care routine for everyone. With transparency and our knowledge, we guide and motivate our customers to choose a sustainable routine and get fantastic results at the same time.
Fighting Climate Change
Reducing Our Carben Footprint – In all parts of our business, we will do our utmost to reduce our carbon footprint, whether it is by making responsible purchasing choices, educating our customers, sending out sustainable packaging or by ensuring fossil-free delivery options.
The Environment in Thought
The boxes in which your goods are delivered are manufactured in a so-called FSC-certified factory, where the material comes from responsible forestry and takes people and the environment into account. They consist of 100% recycled fibre and can be recycled with paper. The cartons are designed to minimise material consumption. We have also chosen not to use bubble wrap in our orders.
We work continuously to develop the next level of climate-smart solutions. For example, we have boxes and packing material in 100% recycled material that you can choose to have your order packed in - then you choose Sustainable Wrapping at checkout. You can also opt out of free samples at checkout.
The ""non-woven"" Skincity bag and the Skincity toiletry bag can be recycled as plastic. The toiletry bag is recycled without a zipper. The Skincity Kokeshi is made from a material called Polyresin, which is 100% recyclable. It is recycled as plastic. If you don't want to receive the Kokeshi, toiletries, bags and free samples, you can make that choice at checkout.
In 2021, within the framework of our sustainability work, we will perform a climate calculation of our entire business - in everything from our deliveries to customers to the coffee our employees enjoy during their break.
Objective of the Climate Calculation
- To get an overview of our total climate impact and increase knowledge of how the entire value chain affects it.
- To create a baseline for Skincity's climate footprint that gives us the opportunity to, through annual measures and calculations, be able to measure progress in our climate goals.
- To be able to compile a list of measures that is relevant in relation to actual emissions in the value chain, which creates a good basis for prioritisation of activities and concretisation of goals.

RICHEMONT GROUP
SUMMARY OF THE CORPORATE CODE OF ETHICS
For years now, the Richemont Group has been committed to conducting its business in accordance with the principles of good corporate governance.
All the companies that make up the Richemont Group ensure the highest standards of integrity in carrying out their business activities, while ensuring respect and consideration for all the partners concerned - customers, employees, suppliers and shareholders alike.
Richemont's values are expressed in the Richemont Corporate Code of Ethics, and its standards of conduct are detailed in the document Standards of Business Conduct , with which Officine Panerai complies.

OFFICINE PANERAI'S CODES OF CONDUCT
Officine Panerai follows the standards set forth by the Richemont Group's Board for Social Responsibility when forming its strategy for corporate social responsibility.
These are the Codes followed by Officine Panerai:
Environmental Code of Conduct
Suppliers Code of Conduct
OFFICINE PANERAI
CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY ACCORDING TO OFFICINE PANERAI
The definition of Corporate Social Responsibility given by the European Commission is responsibility for the impact each enterprise has on society. For Officine Panerai, Corporate Responsibility means, above all, consistency. Consistency with the brand's DNA and with the intrinsic values it expresses such as ethics, transparency, legality and the philosophy of the Richemont Group. This is why for Panerai, Corporate Responsibility starts with taking small concrete steps such as:
- The construction of a new zero-impact Manufacture and a related plan for alternative and more environmentally- friendly transport for all the employees who work there
- The changeover to FSC® certified paper for all printed materials such as catalogues, instruction booklets, special editorial projects and Press Office kits
- Constant attention to the conformity and related certifications of materials used in products destined for the market
- More frequent use of the web in order to reduce the quantity of printed materials, as in the case of the digital version of the catalogue which may be downloaded from the Officine Panerai official website
- The drawing-up of a manual promoting eco-friendly behaviour distributed to employees in order to focus their attention on issues such as energy saving and environmental sustainability
- The realisation of non-profit projects whose goal is to continue over time and have a genuine impact on the community
OFFICINE PANERAI
OUR OBJECTIVES
Officine Panerai, through the CSR policy of the Richemont group and its own code of ethics, has actively begun to:
- Progressively decrease the environmental impact of its manufacturing and commercial activity
- Educate its employees' and suppliers' about an eco-friendly lifestyle
- Support local and international non-profit associations, increasing real-world activity by seeking new non-profit projects to back
ENVIRONMENT
ENVIRONMENT
INTRO
Panerai has begun building a path towards sustainability and corporate social responsibility, starting with the necessary certifications to improve the quality and design characteristic of the brand, as well as the guarantees related to the origin of raw materials and their impact on the environment.
As for the reduction of CO² emissions, Officine Panerai has undertaken the ambitious project of a new zero-impact manufacture to be ready in 2014.

STRAPS
PROTECTION SUISSE DES ANIMAUX
Panerai has begun monitoring the sources of leather used in the production of its straps, responding to a specific request by the Protection Suisse Des Animaux (PSA), which has increased awareness among the major watchmaking brands regarding the ethical issue of animal exploitation.
Officine Panerai has signed a declaration guaranteeing the renunciation of the use of such exotic leathers, thus committing to the continued guarantee of high-quality leather used for its watchstraps while certifying its ethical and environmental impact.
In this way, the brand has set off on a path to respecting the Washington Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES).
Indeed, the objective of CITES is to guarantee that the survival of endangered species is not threatened by commercial operations.
All the alligator leather (Alligator Missisippiensis) selected by Officine Panerai comes from farms in Louisiana, USA and is tanned almost exclusively in Europe.
These farms guarantee the exclusive use of alligators reared and treated according to CITES regulations, while contributing to a constant growth in the number of wild alligators and placing 12-15% of animals back into their natural habitat.
METALS AND PRECIOUS METALS
All suppliers of metals and precious metals must sign the ""Suppliers Code of Conduct""and comply with the guidelines set out by Panerai and the Richemont Group.
THE RESPONSIBLE JEWELLERY COUNCIL (RJC)
The Responsible Jewellery Council (RJC) is a non-profit organisation founded in 2005 whose mission is to promote, within the context of gold and diamond jewellery production, responsible ethical, social and environmental practices that respect human rights, from mining to retail.
Officine Panerai obtained RJC certification in early 2014.

To this aim, suppliers must guarantee that wood production and processing activities comply with local legislation, rules and environmental norms and that such activities be carried out in harmony with the environment.
LED LIGHTING
The new Officine Panerai boutiques were designed and built using LED lighting, with low energy consumption and a high level of environmental sustainability.
LEDs (light emitting diodes) allow full brightness to be reached very quickly, ensuring better efficiency at low temperatures with low emissions of heat. In addition, they do not contain toxic materials. LEDs represent the future of environmentally sustainable lighting, requiring approximately 80% less energy than traditional light bulbs and lasting much longer.

OUR COMMUNICATION MATERIAL
Officine Panerai has begun producing catalogues, brochures, leaflets, invitations, warranties, instruction booklets and press kits on FSC® certified paper, the suppliers of which are committed to very strict policies for the protection of the environment.
Our partners have adopted very high standards of control over the origin of the paper used for printing and the environmental impact of such activities, guaranteeing the use of eco-friendly materials including ink and packaging.
In addition to the FSC® (Forest Stewardship Council) certification, they have also been granted PEFC® certification for the sustainable management of forests, issued by an independent body.
This additional certification meets specific sustainability requirements, particularly with regard to small forest where forest management criteria are more difficult to monitor.
OUR DIGITAL CATALOGUE
Another key step towards better management of environmental resources was the decision to make the Officine Panerai catalogue available for download online, thus significantly reducing the use of paper and ink as well as CO² emissions, generated both by the production and the shipment of each individual catalogue.

manufacturing
OFFICINE PANERAI GOES ""GREEN""
The most ambitious project in terms of eco-sustainability and eco-compatibility has been the new manufacture project.
Ten years on from the inauguration of its Neuchâtel Manufacture, Officine Panerai inaugurated the new plant where all the activities concerning the development, production and assembly of the movements and the watches were transferred.
The new production site opened at the end of 2013 and represents an extraordinary opportunity for the optimisation of production processes both in terms of quantity and quality.
The new Officine Panerai building has zeroenvironmental impact as far as the production of carbon dioxide is concerned thanks to the integration of a number of technologies designed to reclaim and recycle resources, emission-reducing devices, electricity from completely renewable sources and policies promoting eco-sustainable mobility among employees.
The following are a few examples of ways in which the new manufacture satisfies the requirements of zero impact:
The water used in production processes is reused for the toilets, for cleaning and in the cooling systems
The energy produced by the machinery is reused in the heating system
A state-of-the-art heat pump system permits optimisation of the energy produced by both the heating and cooling systems
The objective is to achieve at least the MINERGIE® standard, a building standard that permits rational use of energy and extensive use of renewable energy, thus reducing the impact on the environment of large production sites.

BEST PRACTICES AT THE PANERAI OFFICES
""GUIDELINES FOR ECO-SUSTAINABLE CONDUCT""
In order to encourage Officine Panerai employees to lead, inside and outside the office, a more environmentally sustainable life, an internal committee responsible for CSR has been appointed with the task of drawing up a ""best practices""document to be distributed to each employee.
A series of recommendations and suggestions was collected in the document ""Guide to eco-friendly behaviour in the company"", created with the dual purpose of informing and giving practical indications on how to behave in a more eco-friendly manner: print as little as possible and always shut down your computer before you leave the office, use public transport instead of your car for commuting to work, recycle as much as possible, do not use air conditioning with the windows open - these were just some of the suggestions contained in the document.
WHAT WE DO
At the Officine Panerai offices, particular attention is paid to everyday acts:
- What gets printed and how it is printed: only strictly necessary documents are printed, with preference given to the exchange of files via email and the use of shared folders. Most of all, only official presentations are printed in colour and, where possible, always choosing double sided printing. Paper that can be printed on again is reused.
- What gets shipped and how it is shipped: given the high level of CO² emissions, the use of express couriers is carefully controlled.
- How and when to travel for work: the use of conference calls is preferred and travelling by air can be chosen only for very long distances. Where possible, Panerai suggests that its employees use trains rather than planes which produce much higher emissions of CO².

OUR COLLABORATIONS
For years, Officine Panerai has encouraged initiatives whose ultimate goal is social responsibility both in Italy and abroad. The brand is consistently linked to diverse associations: Fondazione De Marchi and Magica Cleme Onulus (Italy), Les Enfants de Frankie (France), Action for Children (UK), Sailing Heals (USA).
""Captain for a day"", the principle initiative organised on board the Eilean, gives starring roles to children and young adults facing illness and hospital treatment. Real sailing lessons characterise the various activities of this ""exceptional crew"".
Panerai also promotes other, non-sailing initiatives, such as entertainment, laboratory time and excursions, with the aim of improving the health and well-being of patients from these associations while giving continuity to the collaborations born in recent years.

OFFICINE PANERAI FOR PANGAEA
Between 2008 and 2012, Officine Panerai was a partner in celebrated South African explorer Mike Horn's most recent expedition: to sail around every continent aboard the Pangaea yacht, built from recycled materials and the latest in eco-sustainable technology.
The Pangaea expedition's objective was to bring international public awareness to the environmental decline of our planet and create a generation of young ambassadors standing for the preservation of nature and its resources.
This was made possible through the participation of groups of young explorers between the ages of 12 and 20. During various stages of the expedition, they were given the chance to spend time with Mike Horn on board the Pangaea and carry out activities beneficial to the Earth while learning to care for the environment and take responsibility for recycling, energy conservation and eco-sustainability.
Mike Horn and his ""Young Explorers""operated under the expedition's motto of ""Explore, Learn, Act"", which expresses the project's philosophy – shared by Officine Panerai – to the fullest: it's no longer enough to just observe; it's time to act and give it our all. .

globalsalmoninitiative,https://globalsalmoninitiative.org/en/sustainability-report/sustainability-indicators/ ,"Towards the end of the summer of 2016, salmon farms in Chile were affected by a naturally occurring event known as an algal bloom, which caused high levels of fish mortality. An algal bloom is a rapid increase in the population of algae in the sea, or in freshwater, due to particular conditions of warmer water, low wind, and high rates of radiation hitting the water surface.
Due to the particularly strong ENSO (Southern Oscillation) phenomenon that occurred in 2016, algae grew at an exceptional rate. Unfortunately these specific algae use oxygen throughout the day and night which significantly reduces oxygen levels in the water, and they also have a strong toxin that enters the fish through the gills, and causes blood poisoning.
Despite best efforts to foresee, prevent, and effectively manage this natural event, last year’s algal bloom did impact on salmon mortalities. Our fish health experts rely on the latest and best science available to them, and as part of our commitment to the highest standards of fish health, we continue to look for improved approaches to prevent such impacts, and look for innovative solutions to limit future events. If you would like more information on the impacts of the algal bloom or what these numbers mean please contact the GSI secretariat or the company.

All GSI members operate in accordance with national regulation sea lice trigger limits, however, the higher sea lice counts recorded during 2016 are related to the environmentally challenging conditions experienced during the algae bloom. Handlings and treatments were initially postponed to maintain fish health and welfare, allowing sea lice loads to increase, with treatments performed later to reduce counts.

Due to the harmful algal bloom experienced in Chile in 2016, there were higher levels of fish mortality than expected. As some of these fish were already treated for sea lice as part of their fish health management practices, these treatments were also included in the original calculation for sea lice treatments, even if the fish were not finally harvested for human consumption.
Therefore, a second figure has been provided which shows the number of treatments that only surviving fish harvested for consumption received.

annabel-langbein,https://www.annabel-langbein.com/garden/sustainability/ ,"With more than half of the planet's population now living in cities without access to the natural cycles of nature, our world faces tremendous challenges of diminishing resources and a devastating loss of biodiversity. It's hard to imagine that anything we could do as individuals could change this – but it can! Here are a few ideas.
I am committed to ensuring a sustainable future for our food production ecosystems. I sit as a director on the Sustainability Council of New Zealand, which keeps me up to date and well informed on current issues with regard to sustainability and future-proofing our environment and across the food chain. For further information, visit Sustainability Council of New Zealand.
I would urge you to find out more about the significance of GM and support GM-free food production wherever you live. In her book of essays, Small Wonder, novelist and biologist Barbara Kingsolver has written a succinct piece on why this issue is so environmentally important. Entitled A Fist in the Eye of God, it offers compelling reading.
Ruth Ozeki’s novel, All Over Creation, is another excellent read on the subject; it weaves a great story through some of the key GM issues we face globally.
Around the world, farmers' markets are experiencing a resurgence as people seek to source the freshest local produce and the most delicious artisanal products, reconnect with their local community and understand the provenance of the foods they buy and eat.
Wherever I travel in the world, one of my first actions is always to sniff out the local produce markets and spend time discovering the local fruits and vegetables and talking with the passionate producers who grow and sell them.
In New Zealand we are blessed with some wonderful farmers’ markets where you can support local growers and shop for the freshest produce. Here’s a list of some excellent local markets around the country:
It was my grandfather Put who first took me fishing when I was a kid. He always seemed to know where the fish would be biting, and I can still recall the childhood triumphs of a safely landed catch. To this day it remains a simple thrill - bait a hook, drop a line and, with any luck, haul in dinner.
Hopefully, wise management of our planet's fishery resources will help reduce the risk of commercial overfishing and allow us a sustainable catch long into the future. When we shop we need to think about the fish we buy and choose species that are not endangered and that are being fished sustainably. In New Zealand, Forest & Bird's Best Fish Guide will help you make informed choices. Internationally, Greenpeace publishes a Red List of species it believes may be fished unsustainably.
For us recreational fisher folk, we need to land only what we can eat and be open to tasting something new, not just the well-loved favourites. It would be great to think that our grandchildren and their grandchildren in turn could visit fishing spots around the globe and marvel at the wilderness, taking the same pleasure that we do in dropping a line and hauling in a wriggling fish for the table.
Do you find yourself chucking out old food every week, scooping tired celery stalks out of the vege drawer, binning unused mince, chucking stale bread? You’re not alone - it's estimated that we each throw away about 70kg of food a year, or a third of all food bought, and much of it perfectly edible.
It’s bad for the planet and it has a deflating effect on the wallet as well. By introducing a few new practices, you can reduce your household food waste and put away a little extra money as well.
First, take stock of what you already have hidden away in the pantry and freezer before you go shopping. You may be surprised at the number of half-used packets of rice and biscuits you have cluttering up your shelves. Remember that ‘use by’ dates and ‘best before’ labels are very different beasts. ‘Use by’ labels tell you how long a food can be safely used when stored properly - it should not be consumed after that date or you could become ill. ‘Best before’ labels are all about food quality. You can still safely eat food after its ‘best before’ date, it just may not be as nice.
If you're trying to save time and money, plan the main protein portion of your meals for the week in advance, so you only buy what you'll actually use. When you snag a special deal on mince at the supermarket, divide it into smaller portions and pop it in the freezer - it'll last for three to four months. Then you can decide how to use it on the day, depending on the seasonal vegetables you've got at hand.
If you have a glut of fresh vegetables from your garden or favourite market, blanch them in boiling water before freezing to keep them good for two to three months. Don't let your summer herbs go to waste either - harvest them when they're plentiful to make my Herb Oils, then freeze them in iceblock trays. Once frozen, store them in plastic bags in the freezer to add a ray of summer sunshine to winter stews and soups. Chilli Jam and Harvest Tomato Sauce are other useful recipes for making the most of your autumn harvest.
Over-ripe bananas can also be tossed in the freezer for later use in cakes and muffins. The skins will go black but the insides will be fine. Or peel and slice them and freeze free-flow to drop straight into the blender when making smoothies.
Bottling and jam-making is back in vogue and easy to do. It’s a nice way to introduce summer flavours into your winter cooking, and jars of peaches, tomatoes, feijoas and chutneys are pretty on the kitchen shelf. Here's my favourite recipe for Strawberry Jam, plus an easy recipe for Feijoa Chutney.
It's estimated that about a third of household rubbish could be reduced, reused or recycled. That's a huge amount of unnecessary waste going into landfills, and a challenge to us all.
Here are some simple tips for minimising your rubbish output:
* In the western world we each use an average of 300 plastic bags a year. Every single person! Plastic bags can take up to 500 years to break down in a landfill, so make it your new year resolution to get yourself a big, durable reusable bag to use when you shop.
* When possible, buy products that don’t come in a lot of unnecessary packaging. Look for the symbols that mean packaging is recycled and biodegradable
* The health benefits of water are obviously great, but buying water in non-recyclable bottles isn’t great for the environment. So if you prefer bottled water, look for brands packaged in glass or recyclable plastic, and make sure the plastic is BPA (Bisphenol A) free. BPA is a compound used in the manufacturing of many plastics and some studies suggest it may leach into water or food. The concern is that BPA can mimic the body’s own hormones and continued exposure may have negative health effects.
* Give homemade presents, such as Preserved Figs or embroidered tea towels. They save money and resources and your friends and family will appreciate the love and care that goes into them
* Reduce your use of disposable items such as paper plates and plastic cups
* Instead of relying on paper towels, use washable cloths to clean the kitchen bench and wipe up spills
* Use baking paper or kitchen paper instead of plastic wrap when cooking and filling the lunchboxes
* Buy in bulk and transfer to jars in the pantry
* Print on both sides of paper
* Choose recyclable batteries
* Give unwanted clothes away to friends and family or charitable organisations. Plus, stop buying cheap clothes that don’t last - it's a false economy. Quality second-hand clothes are a good option
* Join the 8.5 million worldwide users of freecycle.org to give away reusable household items that you don't want any more - free to a good home!
* Think before you buy. Do you really need a new sofa? Try recovering your old one. Trawl antique and junk shops for abandoned treasures. Tart up old shelves with a couple of coats of paint. The vintage look is all the rage!
Ethical shopping is a broad term that basically means shopping with a conscience, considering the fate of the producers, the animals and the natural environment that brought you the products you use.
There are many things you can do to make sure your shopping expeditions have a positive effect on others. You might want to start by buying locally grown foods, supporting the farmers who stock your nearest farmers' market or the butcher down the road. This is all about reducing your ‘food miles’ (the distance a product travels from its origin to your stomach) and strengthening the bonds of your local community.
You could choose free-range eggs and chicken and pork that have been farmed in an ethical and sustainable way. The living conditions of chickens laying free-range eggs can vary tremendously, so research brands that interest you. The same goes for pork and chicken, although often your independent butcher will stock good free-range products. Your nearest SPCA should be able to offer advice on brands that walk the talk. Alternatively, you could keep a couple of hens in the garden or become friendly with a farmer.
Fair Trade products have been made in a manner which is sustainable, guarantees decent wages and working conditions, and is good for the local economy in the developing countries they come from. Look for Free Trade coffee, tea, nuts, chocolate and dried fruits at your supermarket, or buy products online or from aid organisations.
Just thinking about our energy consumption and its impact on the planet can be overwhelming, but the good news is that every little bit you do helps - it really does. Start in the kitchen, by switching off appliances at the wall when they're not in use (you'd be amazed at how much electricity pilot lights and LED clocks use) and making sure you fill the dishwasher completely before using it.
Replace your light bulbs with eco-bulbs, which use just 20 per cent of the energy that conventional bulbs do. When it comes time to replace your dishwasher and fridge, choose energy-efficient models. Switch off the lights when you leave the room, and use window coverings to keep in heat at night. Good old-fashioned draught stoppers in front of doors are great for minimising chills. If you are really committed to saving energy, think about installing a solar heating system for your water.
In the garden, make motor-powered jobs more planet-friendly by maintaining sharp blades on lawnmowers and hedge trimmers to reduce wasted energy. Instead of using a leaf blower to tidy paths and driveways, get out a broom and enjoy the incidental exercise. Hang your clothes out to dry on the line whenever possible rather than running the dryer, and use solar-powered garden lighting, which looks just as pretty as more expensive, energy-hungry systems. And rather than buying new building materials, whose manufacture burns through yet more energy, get innovative with salvaged items for making patios, walls and garden borders.
It's relatively easy to deal with water wastage in the kitchen. First job is to fix any leaky taps and install tap aerators, which reduce the amount of water used but not the pressure. Instead of washing your vegetables under a running tap, partially fill the basin with water and rinse them. Thaw frozen foods in the fridge rather than under running water in the sink.
Outside, consider using barrels to collect rainwater for watering the vegetable garden and lawn. Water your lawn and plants in the cool of the evening, and concentrate on the roots to minimise waste. Use mulch around the base of each plant and dig it into the soil to help prevent moisture loss in the summer heat.
One of the best things you can do for your sustainable garden is to fill it with native plants that suit the conditions. They not only look great, they are easier to care for.
We all have one, no-one wants a big one, but what really is a carbon footprint? In simple terms, your carbon footprint is the volume of greenhouse gas produced to sustain your lifestyle. Greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide) result from the burning of fossil fuels for electricity, transport and manufacturing, and also from natural sources - methane results from some agricultural processes while nitrous oxide is released into the atmosphere when permafrost melts.
There are two components to your carbon footprint. The primary component is directly controlled by you: how often do you use your car, do you travel by air often, how do you heat your home? The secondary is the upstream effects of your choices - the energy burned to make your trainers, farm the beef for your hamburger or deliver your favourite coffee to the supermarket.
There are all sorts of ways you can address the size of your carbon footprint. It helps to know the impact of simple actions, like running your computer for 32 hours or driving your car 6km, both of which produce 1kg of carbon dioxide.
There are many websites that help you calculate your personal carbon footprint - the average is four tonnes per person per year. The countries with the highest CO2 emissions are China, the United States, Russia and Japan. Interestingly, if you look at which countries have the highest per-capita CO2 emissions, the tiny duchy of Luxembourg is number one, followed by the United States, Australia and Canada.
A contentious, complicated topic, this one, but hugely important. Climate change is the long-term change in our global climate system due to human activity, especially the burning of fossil fuels. Unlike the term ‘global warming’, which refers to the Earth’s surface temperature, climate change takes into account temperature, precipitation, wind and other factors.
While there are natural processes such as volcanic eruptions and variations in sunlight that also impact on the climate, scientists overwhelmingly believe climate change is due to people burning fossil fuels for energy, cutting down forests to plant food and build houses, creating waste byproducts through manufacturing, and other processes with large carbon footprints. Industrialisation in the past 100 years has had an undeniable accelerating effect.
The best-known part of the climate change equation is the greenhouse gas effect, whereby methane, nitrous oxide, water vapour and carbon emissions in Earth’s atmosphere trap heat in the same way a glass greenhouse does. This raises the Earth’s surface temperature and is thought to contribute to the rising ocean level.
Perhaps the most telling indicators of global climate change are glaciers, our most sensitive early warning system. They are believed to be melting and receding at a rate unmatched in the past 5000 years.
But the result of climate change most noticeable to the average person is extreme weather patterns - unusual flooding, unseasonably warm winters, rapid desertification and an increase in tornadoes and droughts.
All the sustainability ideas on this website will help you do your bit towards reducing your carbon footprint - you really can make a difference!
In the simplest terms, food miles refer to the distance your food travels from the producer to the consumer. It is one of the factors used to determine the environmental impact of a particular food, including its potential contribution to climate change.
In the global food market that has developed in the last 30 years or so, food travels significantly further than it ever did before and there is concern that this is having a major impact on the earth, not to mention local producers who are now competing with farmers from distant continents.
The term ‘food miles’ was coined in the United Kingdom 20 years ago, and it is in the UK that the debate about food miles has raged most fierce. There has been particular discussion about the impact of foods from New Zealand, Australia and South Africa being transported from one hemisphere to another for consumption. But food miles are just part of the story when it comes to food sustainability, and many critics say the food miles debate has been very misleading.
You also need to consider the conditions in which your food was produced. How much fertiliser was used, what did the animals eat, what social and economic impact did the food production have on the community where it was raised? In the United States, carbon footprint studies have shown that the transport used to move food from place to place is not nearly as significant as the emissions from whatever pesticides and fertilisers were used to raise the beef, lamb or oranges on your plate.
For an interesting discussion see this report from The New York Times and this report from The Telegraph in the UK. As the Telegraph journalist notes: ""One study by Lincoln University, in New Zealand, found that 2,849kg of carbon dioxide is produced for every tonne of lamb raised in Britain, while just 688kg of the gas is released with imported New Zealand lamb, even after it has travelled the 11,000 miles to Britain."" .

oup,https://academic.oup.com/icesjms/article/72/3/997/686282 ,"Abstract
Norwegian aquaculture has grown from its pioneering days in the 1970s to be a major industry. It is primarily based on culturing Atlantic salmon and rainbow trout and has the potential to influence the surrounding environment and wild populations. To evaluate these potential hazards, the Institute of Marine Research initiated a risk assessment of Norwegian salmon farming in 2011. This assessment has been repeated annually since. Here, we describe the background, methods and limitations of the risk assessment for the following hazards: genetic introgression of farmed salmon in wild populations, regulatory effects of salmon lice and viral diseases on wild salmonid populations, local and regional impact of nutrients and organic load. The main findings are as follows: (i) 21 of the 34 wild salmon populations investigated indicated moderate-to-high risk for genetic introgression from farmed escaped salmon. (ii) of 109 stations investigated along the Norwegian coast for salmon lice infection, 27 indicated moderate-to-high likelihood of mortality for salmon smolts while 67 stations indicated moderate-to-high mortality of wild sea trout. (iii) Viral disease outbreaks (pancreas disease, infectious pancreatic necrosis, heart and skeletal muscle inflammation, and cardiomyopathy syndrome) in Norwegian salmon farming suggest extensive release of viruses in many areas. However, screening of wild salmonids revealed low to very low prevalence of the causal viruses. (iv) From ∼500 yearly investigations of local organic loading under fish farms, only 2% of them displayed unacceptable conditions in 2013. The risk of eutrophication and organic load beyond the production area of the farm is considered low. Despite several limitations, especially limited monitoring data, this work represents one of the world’s first risk assessment of aquaculture. This has provided the Norwegian government with the basis upon which to take decisions for further development of the Norwegian aquaculture industry.
Introduction
Background
The Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) farming industry was first started in Norway in the early 1970s and has now grown to become one of the country’s largest export industries by economic value. In addition to Atlantic salmon, which is by far the most significant species farmed in Norway, there are also commercial farming of rainbow trout [Oncorhynchus mykiss (Walbaum)] and other marine species such as Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua L.) and halibut [Hippoglossus hippoglossus (L.)]. In 2012, the production of Atlantic salmon and rainbow trout in Norway was 1 232 095 and 74 583 tons, respectively, and a total of 1006 marine farms was licensed. These farms are distributed along much of Norway’s coastline.
Aquaculture of salmonids in Norway, and other countries where these species are farmed in significant numbers, is primarily based around the production of eggs and juveniles in freshwater facilities on land, combined with grow out of fish in open marine cages. During the last decades, technical standards for the production of aquaculture infrastructure has improved dramatically. However, the primary methods for cultivation of finfish have remained similar, with the size of sea cages (up to 160 m in circumference) and the number of stocked smolt (up to 200 000 individuals per cage) increasing.
The rapid expansion of the aquaculture industry, both in Norway and other regions where this form of open-cage production has increased, has not occurred without environmental challenges. However, although a significant body of evidence suggests various environmental impacts of aquaculture, the rapid expansion of this industry means that management guidelines and targets to address potential negative effects have generally not developed in association with the rapid expansion of the industry. Therefore, there is a need for more coordinated efforts to identify hazards related to open sea cage farming and evaluate environmental risks.
Risk analysis
Several approaches have been suggested and discussed for risk analysis of marine ecosystems and marine aquaculture activities (Anon., 2006, 2010; Nash, 2007; GESAMP, 2008; Samuel-Fitwi et al., 2012), and similar approaches of risk analysis and assessment have been adapted to animal welfare including welfare of farmed fish (e.g. EFSA, 2012). According to GESAMP (2008), a risk analysis should first involve hazard identification, then risk assessment of these hazards including the assessment of release, exposure, and consequences, followed by risk estimation/evaluation. The latter preferably related to politically defined thresholds of acceptability or level of protection. Subsequently, this can be followed up by appropriate risk management and appropriate risk communication.
A full risk analysis is based on the ability to quantify both the probability of a certain event and its consequences, but in biological systems it is normally very difficult to quantify these factors precisely. Hence, risk analyses in biological systems are often conducted using broad qualitative categories, by scoring the probability and consequences from low to high (e.g. GESAMP, 2008). This can in turn be based on some semi-quantitative assessment or on expert opinion as suggested by Anon. (2006).
In 2009, the Norwegian government established a set of environmental goals for sustainability in the “Strategy for an Environmentally Sustainable Norwegian Aquaculture Industry” (Anon., 2009b; Table 1). In response to this, the Institute of Marine Research, Norway, initiated a risk assessment of Norwegian salmon farming in 2010, and yearly since (Taranger et al., 2011a, b, 2012a, 2013, 2014). These risk assessments were based on identified hazards and specific endpoints or proxies related to environmental impacts of salmon farming (Table 2). The endpoints/proxies were in turn derived from the governmental goals for environmental sustainability mentioned above. Moreover, evaluation thresholds for some of these endpoints/proxies (acceptance levels of impact or level of protection) were proposed (Taranger et al., 2012b), and subsequently used in the risk assessments in 2013 and 2014. Here, we describe the way in which these assessments have been conducted, the methodological limitations and challenges, as well as future needs to data and analytical tools.

Hazard identification
The first step in a risk assessment is to identify the most important hazards. A range of criteria for hazard identification was proposed by GESAMP (2008). This includes an analysis on how potential hazards relates to undesirable changes in the environment/ecosystem. To this end, potential hazards are evaluated for their possible severity, extent and duration of the change, either based on past experiences, analogue situations, or models. Some of the environmental challenges (i.e. hazards) identified include ecosystem and benthic community effects of organic loading and nutrients (Buschmann et al., 2006; Kutti et al., 2008; Bannister et al., 2014), transfer of parasites to native populations (Krkošek et al., 2005, 2013a, b; Jackson et al., 2013; Skilbrei et al., 2013; Torrissen et al., 2013; Serra-Llinares et al., 2014), disease interactions (Glover et al., 2013b; Madhun et al., 2014a), and ecological (Jonsson and Jonsson, 2006) and genetic interactions with wild populations (Crozier, 1993; Clifford et al., 1998b; Skaala et al., 2006; Glover et al., 2012, 2013a).
Based on the accumulating evidence of the severity, geographical extent and duration and/or reversibility of the various impacts related to open sea cage salmon farming in Norwegian coastal waters, we have based the current risk assessment on the following hazards: (i) genetic introgression of escaped farmed salmon into wild populations, (ii) impact of salmon lice (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) on wild salmonid populations, (iii) potential disease transfer from farmed salmon to wild salmonid populations, and (iv) local and regional impacts of organic load and nutrients from marine salmon farms.
Impact of farmed escapees on the genetic integrity of wild Norwegian populations
Risk assessment
In the following chapter, we have considered the following elements of risk assessment; release, exposure, and consequences, in the following manner. Release assessment is defined as the number of farmed salmon escaping into the natural environment, both as reported and unreported numbers of escapees. Exposure assessment is defined as the physical mixing of farmed escaped salmon on the spawning grounds of wild populations, and the subsequent level of genetic introgression resulting from successful spawning. Finally, we have defined consequence assessment as the consequence of genetic introgression for both the short fitness consequences and the long evolutionary consequences on the native populations.
One of the challenges to the continued development of a sustainable aquaculture industry is containment, and each year, thousands or hundreds of thousands of farmed salmon escape into the natural environment in Norway (Figure 1). Furthermore, the official statistics for numbers of escapees reported to the Norwegian Directorate of Fisheries underestimate the real number of escapees. This has been documented through extensive simulated release experiments and statistical modelling (Skilbrei et al., 2015), and is clearly supported by the fact that the legal authorities in Norway have implemented DNA tracing methods to identify the farm of origin for escapees where they have not been reported (Glover et al., 2008; Glover, 2010; Zhang et al., 2013). While the majority of escapees disappear post-escape (Hansen, 2006; Skilbrei, 2010a, b, 2013), each year, significant numbers of farmed salmon are nevertheless observed in rivers inhabited by wild populations (Fiske et al., 2006, Fiske, 2013). It is therefore considerable potential for genetic interaction between these escapees and native populations.

The Atlantic salmon displays considerable population genetic structure throughout its native range. This variation is partitioned in a hierarchical manner, with the largest genetic differences being observed between populations located in different continents or countries, and the smallest differences being observed among neighbouring populations within regions (Ståhl, 1987; Taggart et al., 1995; Verspoor et al., 2005). This structure reflects various processes, for example recolonization patterns, genetic isolation by distance (Glover et al., 2012), and landscape features which modify population connectivity within regions (Dillane et al., 2008). In addition to differences in allele frequencies of molecular genetic markers, Atlantic salmon populations display different life history characteristics. While much of this phenotypic variation is environmentally caused, some of these differences are influenced by underlying genetic variation, and it is generally accepted that these differences potentially reflect adaptations to their native rivers (Taylor, 1991; Garcia de Leaniz et al., 2007; Fraser et al., 2011).
Norwegian farmed Atlantic salmon dominates global production, originates from over 40 Norwegian rivers, and has been subject to approximately ten or more generations of domestication selection (Gjedrem, 2010). Breeding programmes have successfully selected for fish that outgrow their wild counterparts multiple times under farming conditions (Glover et al., 2009; Solberg et al., 2013a, b). In addition to traits that have been directly selected for in the breeding programmes, genetic changes in non-targeted traits have also been observed, for example in predator awareness (Einum and Fleming, 1997), stress tolerance (Solberg et al., 2013a), and gene transcription (Roberge et al., 2006). In addition, decreased genetic variation, as revealed by molecular genetic markers (Norris et al., 1999; Skaala et al., 2004), and lower estimates of heritability for growth (Solberg et al., 2013a), has been observed in farmed populations. Reduced genetic variation in molecular genetic markers reflects founder effects and genetic drift, driven by limited farmed population sizes, while reduction in heritability for growth is likely to be a result of successful directional selection for this trait over multiple generations.
An early study in Ireland estimated introgression of farmed escaped salmon in a native population based upon escapement from a nearby farm (Clifford et al., 1998b). However, despite the fact the genetic changes in native wild populations have been observed in molecular genetic markers as a result of farmed salmon introgressing in Canadian (Bourret et al., 2011), Irish (Crozier, 1993, 2000; Clifford et al., 1998a, b), and Norwegian rivers (Skaala et al., 2006; Glover et al., 2012), until a recent breakthrough in a study of 20 Norwegian rivers (Glover et al., 2013a), the cumulative level of introgression of farmed salmon has not been calculated for any native Atlantic salmon population. This is due to the fact that estimation of cumulative introgression of farmed salmon is statistically challenging (Besnier et al., 2011). In the Norwegian study of 20 rivers (Glover et al., 2013a), a combination of Approximate Bayesian Computation, and genetic data for wild-historical, wild-contemporary and a diverse pool of farm samples that were genotyped for a set of collectively informative single-nucleotide polymorphic markers (Karlsson et al., 2011) was used to estimate introgression for a period of 2–4 decades.
Overall, the study by Glover et al. (2013a) revealed less introgression of farmed Atlantic salmon in many Norwegian populations (Figure 2) than may be expected based upon the reported numbers of escapees in these populations, and estimations from introgression models (Hindar et al., 2006). The authors concluded that spawning success of farmed escaped salmon has been generally low in many Norwegian rivers, a suggestion consistent with earlier estimates of spawning success in controlled experiments (Fleming et al., 1996, 2000). Nevertheless, results from the study demonstrated high levels of admixture in some native populations, and together with an earlier study using microsatellites, reported decreased genetic differentiation among populations over time (Glover et al., 2012, 2013a). The latter of which is consistent with suggestions that widespread introgression of farmed salmon will lead to erosion of population genetic structure among native populations (Mork, 1991).

Estimating the genetic consequences of farmed salmon introgression on life history traits, population fitness, and long-term evolutionary capacity of wild populations is more challenging than estimating introgression. This is in part due to the fact that wild populations display large natural variation in, for example, marine survival, and at the same time are influenced by a wide range of anthropogenic factors (Parrish et al., 1998), which may potentially mask biological changes caused by introgression of farmed salmon. Nevertheless, comparative studies in Ireland and Norway have demonstrated additive genetic variation for fitness in the wild, with offspring of farmed salmon displaying lower survival than fish of native origin (McGinnity et al., 1997, 2003; Fleming et al., 2000; Skaala et al., 2012). Similar studies conducted on other salmonid species in response to releases of hatchery fish have also arrived at similar conclusions (Araki et al., 2008; Araki and Schmid, 2010).
In summary, the presence of farmed escaped salmon on the spawning grounds of native populations, and the potential for genetic interactions between escapees and wild conspecifics, is of concern. This is because farmed escapees may be genetically different from the recipient wild population for several reasons. (i) Farmed salmon usually do not originate from the same wild population into which they migrate post-escape and will therefore display population genetic differences to the native population. (ii) Farmed salmon have been subject to directional selection and thus differ to all wild salmon for those traits. (iii) Through relaxation of natural selection and inadvertent adaption to the domestic environment, farmed salmon have undergone domestication selection and will also differ to wild salmon.
Risk estimation
As part of a national strategy for an environmentally sustainable aquaculture industry (Anon., 2009b), the Norwegian government established the following management goal to prevent genetic interactions of farmed escapees with wild salmon populations: “Aquaculture will not contribute to permanent genetic changes in the genetic characteristics of wild fish stocks” (Table 1). This political target, which forms the basis for the risk estimation, is clearly open for scientific interpretation. However, it was interpreted in a conservative sense for the estimation of risk (Table 2). Thus, any observed genetic change in allele frequencies of molecular genetic markers caused by introgression of farmed salmon would be regarded as permanent genetic change, and therefore in violation of the management goal for sustainability established by the government. The rationale behind this interpretation was first and foremost because molecular genetic markers would be required to directly measure genetic changes in the wild populations. Furthermore, while natural selection will influence the genetic composition of any population, including those where farmed salmon have successfully introgressed, it is unlikely that natural selection will revert the population back to its exact genetic composition before introgression of farmed salmon. This is despite the possibility that natural selection may potentially restore fitness in the natural population.
The documentation of genetic change in a wild population is most directly achieved through the analysis of molecular genetic markers. However, while introgression of farmed Atlantic salmon has been estimated for 20 wild salmon populations in Norway in a 3–4 decade period from 1970 onwards (Glover et al., 2013a), genetic data to estimate introgression of farmed salmon does not exist for the great majority of Norwegian populations. Furthermore, the analysis was being used to address risk of continued and future genetic changes in relation to today’s aquaculture industry rather than changes that have already occurred through historical introgression. Therefore, the frequency of farmed escaped salmon observed in wild populations, which is correlated with genetic introgression of farmed escapees over time (Glover et al., 2012, 2013a) was chosen as the indicator to estimate risk of further genetic changes in each wild population for the estimation of risk (Taranger et al., 2012a).
From 2012 onwards, risk was estimated against the below categories for probability of further genetic changes in wild populations caused by introgression of farmed salmon:
The threshold values were set according to knowledge of natural straying (reviewed by Stabell, 1984) and knowledge about the present correlation between frequency of farmed fish and corresponding genetic introgression (Glover et al., 2012, 2013a). Stabell (1984) showed that most fish returned to their natal river, although in two of the experiences referred to, straying rates were as high as 10% and nearly 20%. We have chosen a threshold value for no or low risk for genetic change at a frequency of farmed fish in the river corresponding to the lower part of the natural straying estimates (4%), while 10% as high risk of genetic change from the upper part of the distribution. Especially, the threshold value for the upper limit is uncertain and might be modified according to new knowledge about the corresponding correlation between frequency of farmed fish and actual introgression (Glover et al., 2013a; Taranger et al., 2014).
No or low risk of genetic change: <4% incidence of farmed salmon
Moderate risk of genetic change: 4–10% incidence of farmed salmon
High risk of genetic change: >10% incidence of farmed salmon
The frequency of farmed salmon in each river surveyed was based upon autumn data where the frequency has been reported for a series of Norwegian rivers ( Fiske, 2013)
. To estimate risk, the frequency of farmed salmon observed in autumn survey was recomputed into an “incidence of farmed salmon” per population using a formula for normalizing data from summer angling catches and autumn surveys ( Diserud et al., 2010
). This was done because the percentage of farmed salmon in autumn samples is usually higher than in summer angling catches ( Fiske et al., 2006
), which is in part because farmed salmon enter rivers later than wild salmon. Thus, without normalization of data, the frequency of farmed salmon in summer and autumn surveys are not directly comparable. While many rivers have both summer and autumn estimates, some only have one or the other estimate and therefore require transforming into what has been defined as the “incidence of farmed salmon”. The formula for normalizing data from summer and autumn surveys to create the “incidence of farmed salmon” were obtained from Diserud et al. (2010
) and are presented below:
arcsin(√(incidence of farmed salmon)=0.116+0.888×arcsin (√(summer frequency))
arcsin(√(incidence of farmed salmon)=0.044+0.699×arcsin(√(autumn frequency))
For the risk assessment, the mean incidence of farmed salmon was estimated in 34 rivers distributed along the Norwegian coast using autumn survey data collected in the period 2010–2012. Only rivers having autumn survey data from a minimum of 2 of the 3 years in this survey period were included in the risk assessment. Based on these data, the risk for genetic changes as a result of farmed salmon introgression was low, moderate, or high for 13 (38%), 11 (32%), and 10 (29%) surveyed rivers, respectively (Figure 3).

Limitations
There are a number of challenges and limitations to the conducted risk assessment and estimation, its approach, and calibration against threshold values and potential impacts. One limitation is the fact that the observed frequency of farmed escapees in rivers has been used as the proxy for potential genetic changes in wild populations caused by introgression of the farmed salmon. This is a limitation because the correlation between the frequency of escapees observed in a river, and documented genetic introgression is only modest (R2 = 0.47, p = 0.0007) (Glover et al., 2013a). As a result, some rivers display higher and lower levels of genetic introgression from farmed than would be estimated by analysis of the frequency of escapees on the spawning grounds. The consequence of this is that the observed frequency of farmed escapees in each population will not accurately reflect the true risk of genetic changes for all populations, and only by using genetic methods directly will the risk be able to be quantified accurately.
The underlying causes of the lack of a strong relationship between the observed frequency of escapees and genetic introgression are important to identify to help improve the accuracy of the risk assessment in the future. From their genetic study of introgression in 20 Norwegian rivers, Glover et al. (2013a) identified both technical and biological elements that are likely to influence the strength of the relationship between the observed frequency of escapees and genetic introgression. Two of the primary components suggested were potential inaccuracies in the frequency of escapees reported for each river (e.g. limited, biased, or non-standardized sampling or reporting), and the fact that the density of the native population, especially on the spawning grounds, may also influence relative success of farmed escapees through spawning competition (Fleming et al., 1996, 2000). In the future, models may be used which include covariables in addition to just the incidence of farmed salmon to predict genetic changes.
A further limitation of the present risk assessment is that it was only conducted for 34 rivers for the 2013 risk assessment. These rivers were chosen as they had autumn survey data published (Fiske, 2013) and thus readily available for assessment of risk for the period 2010–2012. In Norway, there are over 400 salmon rivers and for ∼220 of them the status of the stocks are assessed (Anon., 2013b). Thus, the rivers investigated in the current risk assessment only represent a small proportion of those in Norway. Therefore, it is not possible to make clear regional inferences regarding introgression of farmed salmon, only for a small number of specific rivers. Data for the frequency of farmed salmon exist for a larger number of rivers than are currently included in this risk assessment. However, the quality of some of these data, the reporting and availability of the data are highly variable. It was for this reason that the risk assessment was only conducted for the 34 rivers.
Clearly, there is a significant need to increase efforts to expand and improve the monitoring of escaped salmon in a larger number of Norwegian rivers using data gathered and reported in a standardized manner. This will initially be able to improve estimates of the proportion of escaped salmon and will also provide a better foundation for the collection of representative samples for subsequent use in genetic analysis to validate introgression in rivers. An effort to coordinate data collection of escapees has been initiated within Norway in 2014, and in the future it is predicted that the risk assessment will be conducted in a much larger number of rivers.
In addition to technical and data availability challenges linked with the risk assessment and its implementation, there are gaps in current knowledge which limit the ability to identify threshold tolerance limits for introgression of escapees and the level of potentially detrimental effects on the wild populations. Current knowledge points toward a potential negative effect of introgression of farmed Atlantic salmon on the fitness and future evolutionary capacity of recipient wild populations. This is when taking into consideration data available from experimental comparisons of farmed and wild salmon especially in the natural environment (McGinnity et al., 1997, 2003; Fleming et al., 2000; Skaala et al., 2012), background knowledge of salmon biology, life history and ecology, and extensive information from hatchery-fish supplementation for both Atlantic salmon as well as other salmonid species in both the Atlantic and Pacific (Araki et al., 2008; Araki and Schmid, 2010). Nevertheless, significant gaps in understanding of the biological consequences of introgression of farmed salmon remain. These need to be quantified in the future to make a full assessment of risk of biological consequences following introgression of escapes. The major points are summarized in Table 3.

Salmon lice impact on wild salmonids
Salmon lice (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) from salmon farms are recognized as an important hazard to wild anadromous salmonids in Norwegian coastal waters (Serra-Llinares et al., 2014). Salmon lice on farmed salmon produce large amounts of planktonic larvae stages that spread via the water currents and can infect migrating Atlantic salmon post-smolts, as well as sea trout (Salmo trutta) and Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus) that stay in coastal waters (Jones and Beamish, 2011). Hydrodynamic models coupled with biological data show that salmon lice can be transported up to 200 km over a 10-d period, although most dispersed 20–30 km (Asplin et al., 2011; Serra-Llinares et al., 2014). The number of salmon lice allowed on farmed salmon is tightly controlled by Norwegian legislation (www.mattilsynet.no). However, the large number of farmed salmon, with ∼300 million smolts put into sea cages every year along the Norwegian coast, results in worse case releases in the order of more than a billion salmon lice larvae daily from salmon farms in Norway (Taranger et al., 2014).
New analyses reveal strong correlation between salmon farms and lice infections on wild salmonids in Norwegian coastal waters (Helland et al., 2012; Serra-Llinares et al., 2014). The Norwegian salmon lice monitoring programme on wild salmonids demonstrate annual lice epidemics, most likely connected to the density of salmon farms in the surrounding areas as well as the seasonal dynamics of salmon lice infections on farmed salmon (Jansen et al., 2012; Serra-Llinares et al., 2014; Taranger et al., 2014). A series of experiments has shown that salmon lice may affect anadromous salmonids (reviewed in Finstad and Bjørn, 2011; Anon., 2012; Torrissen et al., 2013).
To assess the risk of salmon lice infection on wild populations, we have considered the following elements of risk assessment: release, exposure, and consequences in the following manner. The release assessment is based on estimating the production and distribution of infectious salmon lice. The exposure assessment is based on estimating the lice infection on wild salmonid populations using different methods for direct measurements of salmon lice infections on salmon and sea trout. The consequence assessment is the effect salmon lice have on salmonid populations in terms of estimated likelihood of increased marine mortality and/or reduced reproduction based on the exposure assessment.
Risk assessment
All salmon farming sites in Norway report the numbers of salmon lice on the fish weekly when the temperature is >4°C. This is reported together with fish biomass and number of individual salmon per cage (reported each month). Based on the number of sexually mature female salmon lice on the fish on each farming site, the number of infectious salmon lice larvae produced from the different salmon farms are calculated (Jansen et al., 2012). However, at present we do not have enough information and validated models to accurately estimate the impact of the salmon lice infections on wild populations based on reported data from the fish farms (Taranger et al., 2013, 2014).
The lice infection on wild salmonid populations is estimated using different methods as part of a national monitoring programme (Serra-Llinares et al., 2014; Taranger et al., 2014). These methods encompass catch of sea trout and Arctic charr in traps or nets (Bjørn et al., 2011a), and salmon post-smolts caught in special surface trawls in fjord systems (Holm et al., 2000; Bjørn et al., 2007b; Holst et al., 2007). In addition, groups of small sentinel cages containing on average 30 farmed salmon post-smolts are placed in the fjords to monitor the salmon lice infection rate. The fish are kept in the cages for 3 weeks before lice are counted on all the fish, and the procedure repeated three times during spring and summer (Bjørn et al., 2011a, 2013). The sampling programme is focused on areas with high salmon farming activity (Figure 4), as well as some fjords that are protected against salmon farming. The assessment in the period 2010–2013 is based on data from 1 to 5 sites per fjord in 13–16 fjord systems annually, and with increasing numbers of fish sampled at each site in the later years (Table 4). More details about the national salmon lice monitoring programme are provided elsewhere (Helland et al., 2012; Bjørn et al., 2013; Serra-Llinares et al., 2014).

To conduct the risk assessment on the potential impact on salmonid smolts that migrate from the rivers in spring and early summer on the one hand, and the risk of sea trout and Arctic charr that stay in fjords and coastal waters during summer, the national monitoring programme covers two different periods. These periods are adjusted for different timing of smolt migration and seawater residence along the Norwegian coast (Anon., 2011), with an earlier sampling window in the southern part of Norway and later further north. This corresponds to two assumed “critical periods”, the first during spring when the salmonid smolts leave the rivers and enters the estuaries and fjords (Period 1), and the second period to estimate the accumulated infection rate on sea trout and Arctic charr that remain in fjords and on the coast during summer (Period 2). See also Anon. (2011) for further information on median migration dates and migration speeds for Atlantic salmon post-smolts in Norwegian fjords.
A range of laboratory studies demonstrate the impact of salmon lice on salmon post-smolts (Grimnes and Jakobsen, 1996; Finstad et al., 2000, 2010; Heuch et al., 2005; Wagner et al., 2008). It has been shown that 0.04–0.15 lice per g fish weight can increase stress levels, reduce swimming ability and create disturbances in water and salt balance in Atlantic salmon (Nolan et al., 1999; Wagner et al., 2003, 2004; Tveiten et al., 2010). In sea trout, ∼50 mobile lice are likely to give direct mortality (Bjørn and Finstad, 1997), and only 13 mobile lice, or∼0.35 lice per g fish weight might cause physiological stress in sea trout (weight range of 19–70 g; Wells et al., 2006, 2007). Moreover, ∼0.05–0.15 lice per g fish weight were found to negatively affect sexually maturing Arctic charr (Tveiten et al., 2010).
According to a review by Wagner et al. (2008), infections of 0.75 lice per gram fish weight, or ∼11 salmon lice per fish, can kill a recently emigrated wild smolt of ∼15 g if all the salmon lice develop into preadult and adult stages. Studies of naturally infected wild salmon post-smolts indicate that only those with <10 lice survived the infection (Holst et al., 2007). This is consistent with field studies on salmon lice infections in salmon post-smolts in the Norwegian Sea. Over a decade of surveys, no post-smolts was found with >10 salmon lice, and fish with up to 10 mobile lice were observed to be in poor condition with low blood count and poor growth (Holst et al., 2007). New studies of naturally infected wild salmon post-smolts also show that sea lice are fatal at high infections (Berglund Andreassen, 2013). More work in this field is in progress.
Population-wise effects of salmon lice have been demonstrated on wild salmonids in Ireland and Norway. This was studied by protecting individually tagged Atlantic salmon smolts against salmon lice (using Substance EX or Slice) before they were released into the sea near their respective home rivers (Finstad and Jonsson, 2001; Hazon et al., 2006; Skilbrei and Wennevik, 2006; Hvidsten et al., 2007; Skilbrei et al., 2008, 2013; Jackson et al., 2011, 2013; Anon., 2012; Gargan et al., 2012; Krkošek et al., 2013a, b; Vollset et al., 2014). These studies suggest that salmon lice infections increase the marine mortality in areas with intensive salmon farming activity.
Risk estimation
The risk assessment on salmon lice is based on Goal 1 in the policy document on sustainable aquaculture by the Norwegian government from 2009 (Anon., 2009b, Table 1) stating that “Disease in fish farming will not have regulating effect on populations of wild fish…”. This target has in this risk estimation been interpreted as “Salmon lice from fish farming significantly increase the mortality of wild salmonids” (Table 2).
A salmon lice risk index, attempting to estimate the increased mortality due to salmon lice infections, was proposed by Taranger et al. (2012a) and are based on the assumption that small salmonid post-smolts (<150 g body weight) will suffer 100% lice-related marine mortality, or return prematurely to freshwater for sea trout, in the wild if they are infected with >0.3 lice g−1 fish weight. Furthermore, the lice-related marine mortality is estimated to 50%, if the infection is between 0.2 and 0.3 lice g−1 fish weight, 20% if the infection rate is between 0.1 and 0.2 lice g−1 fish weight, and finally 0% lice-related mortality if the salmon lice infection is <0.1 lice g−1 fish weight.
For larger salmonids (over 150 g), we assume that lice-related mortality or compromised reproduction will be 100% in the group if they have >0.15 lice g−1 fish weight, 75% for lice infections between 0.10 and 0.15 lice g−1 fish weight, 50% for lice infections between 0.05 and 0.10 lice g−1 fish weight, 20% for lice infections between 0.05 and 0.01 lice g−1 group, and finally 0% if the salmon lice infection is <0.01 lice g−1 fish weight.
For both indices, increased mortality risk or compromised seawater growth or reproduction at population level are calculated as the sum of the increased mortalities/compromised reproduction for the different “infection classes” in the sample, reflecting the distribution of the intensity of salmon lice infections of the different individuals sampled. This assumes that individuals caught with traps, gillnets or trawls are representative for the various salmonid populations in that fjord area. The risk was further scored according to the system proposed by Taranger et al. (2012a); as low (<10% estimated increase in mortality; green colour), moderate (yellow) for those with between 10 and 30% increase, and high (red) if the increase is calculated as >30%.
The current assessment is based on these scorings, and we use data from the national monitoring programme on salmon infections in wild salmonids (Bjørn et al., 2010, 2011b, 2012, 2013). Separate result tables are presented for the risk for Atlantic salmon smolts (Period 1; Table 5) and for sea trout and the Arctic charr populations (Period 2; Table 6). The results are sorted by county from south to north and by fjord system.
Table 5.
Estimated risk for lice-related mortality (%) of Atlantic salmon post-smolts based on lice levels on sea trout caught in traps or gillnets and with weight <150 g in Period 1 at the sites from south to north in Norway in 2010–2013.

Table 6.

The results indicate considerable variation in risk between years and sampling locations. Moreover, these data strongly indicate a much higher risk for sea trout (and also Arctic charr in the Northern regions) compared with Atlantic salmon post-smolts and reveal moderate-to-high risk of population-reducing effects on sea trout in most counties with high salmon farming activity. The risk of population-reducing effects for Atlantic salmon varies much more between years and sites, and was low at most sites in 2010 and 2013, but moderate and high at several sites 2011 and 2012.
Limitations
The assessment in the period 2010–2013 is based on data from 13 to 16 fjord systems annually. Despite large field effort (Bjørn et al., 2011b, 2012, 2013), the geographical coverage is insufficient in terms of the distribution of salmon farms and wild salmonid populations along the Norwegian coast. There are also problems considering how well the different sampling methods are representative for the different anadromous populations in that area. We have limited data on salmon lice infections in migrating Atlantic salmon smolts, so the risk assessment for salmon is mainly conducted by the use data on salmon lice infections on sea trout caught in traps and gillnets in Period 1 as proxy for the risk to Atlantic salmon post-smolts. Lice infections on trout may not be directly proportional to lice infections on migrating salmon smolt. It is likely that differences in, for example, migratory behaviour and marine ecology exposes salmon and sea trout smolts for different sea lice infection risk (Anon., 2011), even within the same fjord system (Bjørn et al., 2007a, 2011b, c, 2013; Serra-Llinares et al., 2014). The link between individual lice infections and population effects is also very uncertain. There is therefore uncertainty of the current risk assessment both for Atlantic salmon, and for sea trout and Arctic charr. Moreover, the current data are presented without any estimates of uncertainty, which must be included in future analyses.
Future
The “Strategy for an environmentally sustainable aquaculture industry” (Anon., 2009b) states that no disease, including lice, should have a regulatory effect on wild fish. The monitoring of salmon lice infection of wild salmonids is an important verification of whether this goal is achieved, and whether the measures taken are appropriate and sufficient. An indicator system that allows detection of possible problems needed therefore to be established. Hitherto, this assessment has been based on data from the national monitoring of sea lice. An analysis of the historical data in this monitoring series (2004–2010) shows that both the extent and nature of the data have had some weaknesses that limit the ability to analyse and understand the observed variation in infections on wild fish (Helland et al., 2012; Serra-Llinares et al., 2014). Therefore, monitoring and risk assessment based only on lice counts on wild salmonids is not considered sufficient.
Consequently, a rather radical change in the monitoring, advisory and management system for lice has therefore been proposed (Taranger et al., 2012b, 2013, 2014; Bjørn et al., 2013; Serra-Llinares et al., 2014). This system is based on (i) detection and forecasting of increased production of infectious salmon lice using models, (ii) verification of infection pressure through risk-based and adapted surveillance on wild salmonids and (c) extended risk assessment based on a considerably larger dataset and fine scale hydrodynamic lice dispersal modelling to assess the effect on wild populations, which then allows adjustment of measures taken by management and industry to reduce this effect to levels within the objective of the strategy. This is now possible due to better knowledge about the relationship between intensive salmon farming activity and infection pressure (Helland et al., 2012; Jansen et al., 2012; Serra-Llinares et al., 2014; Taranger et al., 2014), and better and more accessible farming and environmental data (Jansen et al., 2012; Taranger et al., 2014).
A preliminary analysis indicates that under realistic conditions of lice infections, water currents, temperature and salinity, and relative lice infections may be predicted using a coupled hydrodynamic-biological lice dispersion model. With further calibrations and validation, such a system can probably be developed at least for specific areas along the Norwegian coast. As validation, calibration, and implementation of such a risk-based monitoring system is done, more of the monitoring could be based on the model and less on catch of wild salmonids. The preliminary model results are encouraging in terms of validation and calibration the model predictions against observed infection of wild salmonids. However, considerable research and development remains, where the main challenges are:
The system for detecting problem areas based on farming data and sea lice infections of notification of problem areas need to be further developed and operationalized, and systems for risk-based and adapted surveillance on wild salmonids must be developed.
Coupled hydrodynamic-biological lice dispersion models must be validated and calibrated against observed infection levels on wild salmonids in the field.
Knowledge about the ecological effects of a given infection pressure on stocks of wild salmonids (population-reducing effects) must be increased so that more precise predictions can be developed.
Disease transfer from farmed salmon to wild fish
Background
Infectious diseases represent a major problem in Norwegian fish farming, despite successful development and application of vaccines against a range of pathogens. In addition to lice (considered separately above), viral diseases currently represent the largest disease problems in Norwegian aquaculture (Johansen, 2013). In the period 2005–2012, the four most frequent viral diseases [infectious pancreatic necrosis (IPN), pancreas disease (PD), heart and skeletal muscle inflammation (HSMI), and cardiomyopathy syndrome (CMS)] had 400–500 outbreaks annually (Johansen, 2013). The main reason for the dominance of viral diseases is the lack of effective vaccines. Bacterial diseases, on the other hand, cause only ∼20 outbreaks annually, reflecting that the currently used bacterial vaccines provide good protection (Austin and Austin, 2007). Among the parasites, parvicapsulosis due to the myxosporean Parvicapsula pseudobranchicola is a problem mainly in northern Norway, whereas heavy gill infections with the microsporidian Paranucleospora theridion and the amoeba Paramoeba perurans occur mostly in the southern parts of the country. The significance of infections with the former two parasites is unclear, while amoebic gill disease (AGD) has so far been detected only during fall in 3 years (2006, 2012–2013).
For most pathogens, clear evidence for transmission from farmed to wild fish is limited (Raynard et al., 2007). Most of the diseases that currently cause problems in fish farms are likely enzootic, originating from wild fish. This implies that these infections occur or occurred in the past at some “background” level in wild stocks. Such considerations complicate an estimation of the impact of aquaculture, since the “normal” prevalence range of many important disease agents is unknown. However, in two cases exotic pathogens have been introduced in association with farming activities. These have clearly affected wild Atlantic salmon populations.
The ectoparasite Gyrodactylus salaris (Monogenea) was first detected in Norway in 1975 (Johnsen et al., 1999). There have been several introductions of G. salaris to Norway (Hansen et al., 2003) linked to the import of salmonids from Sweden. Later, the parasite has spread (or has been spread) to many rivers (Johnsen et al., 1999). By 2005, G. salaris had been detected in 45 rivers and 39 freshwater farms (Mørk and Hellberg, 2005). Norwegian Atlantic salmon stocks are very susceptible to G. salaris, and gyrodactylosis in farmed salmon may lead to 100% mortality if not treated (Bakke, 1991;,Bakke et al., 1992; Bakke and MacKenzie, 1993). Mortality in rivers is high, with the density of Atlantic salmon parr being reduced by 50–99% (Johnsen et al., 1999).
Aeromonas salmonicida, the causative agent of furunculosis, was introduced to Norway in 1964, when furunculosis was detected in a single farm that received rainbow trout from Denmark. The disease then spread to other farms and wild fish within a limited area, being detectable there until 1979. A second introduction occurred in 1985, in connection with an import of Atlantic salmon smolts from Scotland. The disease then spread rapidly to farms and wild fish, and in 1992 a total of 550 salmon farms and 74 river systems were affected (Johnsen and Jensen, 1994). This rapid spread of the disease was likely facilitated by frequent escapement events involving infected fish (Johnsen and Jensen, 1994). Mortality due to furunculosis was registered in many rivers among escaped salmon, wild salmon, and trout. Mortality in farmed fish was high, reaching 50%, but the disease was first controlled by antibiotics and subsequently effectively with oil-based vaccines (Sommerset et al., 2005; Johansen, 2013).
These two examples show the devastating effects that introductions of exotic pathogens can have. Even when disregarding agents only known from non-salmonids, there is a large number of potential pathogens (i.e. hazards) infecting salmonids elsewhere that could have significant impact on both salmon farming and wild fish populations in Norway if introduced (Raynard et al., 2007; Brun and Lillehaug, 2010). Import of live fish represents the major threat to both fish farming and wild stocks, since this may lead to the introduction of exotic pathogens. However, G. salaris infections have not been detected in Atlantic salmon hatcheries in recent years (Hytterød et al., 2014 and references therein), and the parasite does not survive in seawater. Furunculosis outbreaks in farms are rare, since most farmed salmon is protected through vaccination. Regarding disease transfer from farmed salmon to wild salmonids, these diseases are currently considered to be under control.
The detection of disease in wild fish and estimating disease impact on wild populations is difficult. Clinically affected fish usually disappear quickly in nature (e.g. predated). Epizootics with mass mortality of fish are rare, but have occurred in Norway (Bakke and Harris, 1998; Sterud et al., 2007) and elsewhere (Hyatt et al., 1997; Gaughan et al., 2000). Such episodes are usually caused either by an exotic pathogen introduced to naïve host populations (Bakke and Harris, 1998) or by exceptional environmental conditions such as high temperature (Sterud et al., 2007). However, infection with native (enzootic) agents under normal environmental conditions can cause disease in individuals and affect an individual's survival or investment in reproduction. Hence, all pathogens may contribute to the regulation of wild populations at some level (May and Anderson, 1979; May, 1983), although the impact may vary and is often the result of a complex interaction between hosts, pathogens, environment, and predators (Dobson and Hudson, 1986; Combes, 2001).
Risk assessment
There is relatively little data available on the infection status of Norwegian wild salmonid stocks with respect to the most important pathogens that affect farmed salmon (e.g. viral agents). The available data mainly concerns returning adult salmon and some local sea trout populations screened with molecular methods (Kileng et al., 2011; Garseth et al., 2012, 2013a, b, c; Biering et al., 2013; Madhun et al., 2014a, b). Studies on the occurrence of viral infections in early life stages of salmonids are only fragmentary (e.g. Plarre et al., 2005).
Due to the limited data available, the disease status (outbreak statistics) in Norwegian fish farming is used as a proxy of the infection pressure from farmed salmon to wild salmonids. Information regarding disease outbreaks on Norwegian fish farms is gathered by the Norwegian Veterinary Institute (NVI) and published annually in their Fish Health Reports (e.g. Johansen, 2013). These data record official diagnoses from NVI, as well as information from the local fish health services. This information is likely to be biased towards the more serious diseases, particularly those that are required by law to be reported to government authorities. Subclinical infections may be common and may also contribute to the spread of pathogens. However, these infections are usually not detected. Despite shortcomings, these data are the best currently available information and give a reasonably good indication of the disease status of the majority of farmed fish in Norway.
Most diseases in Norwegian salmon and rainbow trout farms are represented by only a few outbreaks, often representing geographically separate cases (Johansen, 2013). However, some diseases have a large number of outbreaks/diagnoses, and are those most likely to cause elevated infection pressures that may affect wild populations. At present the most common diseases in Norwegian salmon farming are the viral diseases PD, IPN, CMS and HSMI (Table 7; Johansen, 2013). In addition, AGD due to Paramoeba perurans is an emerging problem (Hjeltnes, 2014). The listed viral diseases have caused some 400 or more outbreaks each year since 2005. Outbreaks are often more frequent in certain regions and at certain times of the year, leading to a consideration also of spatial and temporal variation in the potential infection pressure (Table 8).

We have considered the following elements of risk assessment regarding the viral agents salmonid alphavirus (SAV), infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV), piscine myocarditis virus (PMCV), and piscine reovirus (PRV); release, exposure, and consequences as follow. The release assessment is the assumed infection pressure as proxied by the outbreak statistics. The exposure assessment is a consideration of the spatial and temporal concurrence of wild salmonids with release. A consequence assessment should consider two aspects: (i) evidence for virus transmission and (ii) impact of viral infections. However, the impact is in all the considered cases are unknown, and only evidence for virus transmission can be discussed.
Pancreas disease: salmonid alphavirus
PD in Atlantic salmon and rainbow trout is caused by SAV. In Norway, there are currently two regionalized PD epidemics caused by SAV3 (south of Hustadvika, 63° N) and SAV2 (north of 63° N). Experimental studies show transmission of SAV via water, and epidemiological studies provide evidence for horizontal farm to farm spread (Nelson et al., 1995; McLoughlin et al., 1996; Kristoffersen et al., 2009; Stene, 2013; Stene et al., 2014). The virus has been shown to survive for several weeks in the environment (Graham et al., 2007) and thus may be carried long distances with currents (Stene, 2013; Stene et al., 2014). SAV2 may have a different outbreak pattern than SAV3, since outbreaks tend to occur later in the year (Johansen, 2013). For the southern region (SAV3), the period in which smolts migrate and adult salmon return coincides with many SAV3 outbreaks (Table 8; Johansen, 2013). In the northern region (SAV2), most outbreaks occur later in the year. This may signify that most of the smolt migration precedes peak virus spread in the SAV2 region. On the other hand, returning salmon and sea trout are likely more exposed, but screening indicates that very few wild fish are infected (Biering et al., 2013). Infected escaped salmon can enter rivers in fall, possibly exposing wild fish including naïve juveniles to the virus (Madhun et al., 2014a).
Screening of sea trout (Biering et al., 2013; Madhun et al., 2014b) indicates that sea trout in areas with high frequency of PD outbreaks are not infected with SAV. This is in accordance with injection experiments, which suggest that sea trout is more resistant to SAV than salmon (Boucher et al., 1995). SAV infections have been detected in wild salmonids and wild flatfish (Nylund, 2007; Snow et al., 2010; Biering et al., 2013), but PD has not been observed in wild fish.
Altogether, there are yet no data that confirm SAV transmission from farmed salmon to wild fish, but transmission of virus to wild fish is considered likely due to the large number of outbreaks and the documented efficient horizontal transmission of SAV. The probability of transmission of SAV to wild salmon is considered to be moderate for migrating smolts in the southern PD-region due to the temporal overlap between outbreaks and migration, whereas it is considered to be low in the northern PD-region as most of the migration is finished before the major outbreak period. For returning salmon, the probability of infection is considered to be low in both PD-regions based on the available screening results. The probability of SAV transmission to wild salmon is considered to be low in areas with no or few outbreaks. The probability of infection of sea trout during the marine phase is also considered to be low.
Infectious pancreatic necrosis: infectious pancreatic necrosis virus
IPNV is a robust, long-lived birnavirus that infect many different fish species in both fresh water and seawater (e.g. Reno, 1999). The virus is enzootic in Norway. IPN cause significant losses in fish farming in most areas in Norway (Johansen, 2013). However, there are indications of a downwards trend in outbreaks and losses, which might be caused by the increased use of IPN resistant fish (Johansen, 2013). The virus is shed into the water by infected fish, and is spread to other farms by water currents (see, e.g. Mortensen, 1993; Wallace et al., 2005; Raynard et al., 2007; Johansen et al., 2011). A higher prevalence of IPNV has been found in wild fish near salmon farms with clinical outbreaks of IPN, compared with fish at distant sites (Wallace et al., 2005, 2008). Fish surviving an IPNV infection often become persistent carriers of the virus, but viral shedding from carriers has not been demonstrated (Johansen et al., 2011). The prevalence of IPNV in wild fish is low (Brun, 2003; Wallace et al., 2005), and farmed fish are probably a major source of virus in the marine environment. Disease outbreaks in wild salmon have not been described, but mortality in wild marine fish due to IPN has been reported elsewhere (Stephens et al., 1980; Mcallister et al., 1984).
Due to the large number of annual outbreaks, the demonstrated robustness and infectivity of the virus, as well as the wide range of hosts, the probability of IPNV transmission from farmed to wild fish is considered as moderate. The extent and consequences of such transmission are unknown.
Heart and skeletal muscle inflammation: piscine reovirus
HMSI affects farmed salmon along the entire coast of Norway. HSMI outbreaks mainly occur 5–9 months after sea-transfer. The causative agent is an Orthoreovirus,PRV (Palacios et al., 2010; Løvoll et al., 2012). The disease can be produced experimentally using infected tissue, infected cell culture, or by cohabitation (Kongtorp et al., 2004; Martinez-Rubio et al., 2012, 2013). PRV is present in high densities in salmon with HSMI, but high infection intensity can be found also in clinically healthy salmon. PRV infections have been detected in wild salmon along the entire coast of Norway and have been detected in sea trout (Biering et al., 2013; Garseth et al., 2013b). Analyses of PRV genotypes in wild Atlantic salmon, farmed salmon, and sea trout have suggested an extensive spread of the virus along the coast, and establishment in wild populations. This spread is probably due to extensive transportation of fish between areas over a long period (Garseth et al., 2013c). However, there are no reports of HSMI in PRV infected wild salmonids (e.g. Garseth et al., 2013b). In Norway sea trout are only rarely (1.4–3%) infected (Garseth et al., 2012; Biering et al., 2013) with PRV. PRV infections have been detected in some marine fish species, but the virus genotype is unknown (Wiik-Nielsen et al., 2012). It is not known how long and in what quantities PRV is shed from infected fish nor viral survival in seawater. However, modelling suggests that the virus can be transported over longer distances than SAV (Aldrin et al., 2010; Kristoffersen et al., 2013). The latter findings suggest that the virus is relatively stable and may spread over large areas.
Since PRV infections are widespread in farmed salmon, may readily be transmitted, and is detectable in >10% of the wild salmon examined, it is considered likely that PRV is transmitted from farmed to wild salmon. HSMI occurrence in wild salmon and other wild fish are unknown (Garseth et al., 2013b, Madhun et al., 2014b).
Cardiomyopathy syndrome: Piscine myocarditis virus
CMS is a serious disease in salmon, and is caused by a Totivirus, PMCV (Løvoll et al., 2010; Haugland et al., 2011). CMS can be transmitted experimentally by injecting heart tissue homogenates from diseased fish, PMCV from cell culture, and by cohabitation (Haugland et al., 2011). Infections are long-lasting, with a gradual development of cardiac pathology.
PMCV has been detected in farmed Atlantic salmon along the entire Norwegian coast, but is not as widespread as PRV. PMCV infection has also been detected in a few wild salmon in Norway (Garseth et al., 2012), and CMS-like lesions have been observed in the hearts of wild salmon before the discovery of the virus (Poppe and Seierstad, 2003). Large-sized wild salmon represent the only known natural reservoir for PMCV. There are no studies on shedding of PMCV from diseased fish or carriers, or on virus survival in water.
Due to the large number of hosts, prolonged infections, and the documented virus spread in cohabitation experiments, we assume that the virus is present in the environment and that the infection pressure around farms harbouring the virus is elevated. Examination of wild returning salmon detected only very few (3/1350) infected with PMCV (Garseth et al., 2012; Biering et al., 2013). Such a low prevalence, which may represent natural rather than fish farming-related infections, suggests that PMCV transmission from farmed to wild salmon is infrequent. Therefore, the probability of infection in wild salmon due to virus released from farms is considered low. Due to a general lack of data, particularly regarding young fish, it is not possible to assess the impact of PMCV infection in wild salmon.
Limitations of the analysis
There is a scarcity of data on infections and lack of evidence for disease in wild salmonids for the four viral agents considered. A large number of outbreaks suggest extensive spread of virus, and consideration of timing also often substantiates an exposure of wild salmonids to the viral agents. A serious limitation in the risk assessment is a lack of information on infections due to these agents in wild fish, particularly in salmon smolts. These may be less susceptible than their farmed peers, but may also suffer mortality due to the infections. Such mortality would likely occur through predation (i.e. virus induced). In either case, the returning 1 or 2 sea-winter salmon could be found to be virus free, as is indeed generally the case regarding SAV. Juvenile fish is often particularly susceptible to viral infections. Escaped virus infected farmed salmon can enter rivers in fall (e.g. Madhun et al., 2014a), where juvenile salmonids may be exposed to released virus. The impact of SAV, PRV, and PMCV infections on juvenile salmonids is unknown. The abundance of escaped salmon in Norwegian rivers (see above) indeed suggests a high potential for interaction at this stage. Hence, due to lack of data, consequence assessments cannot be done for the four viral agents considered.
Here, we have focused on the four major diseases currently prevalent in Norwegian salmon farming. All are viral diseases, and a large number of outbreaks are reported annually. However, low prevalence does not necessarily mean low impact, and diseases that at present are under control might surge and become a threat to wild populations. Subclinical or apparently benign infections may also have unforeseen ecological effects in nature by affecting survival (i.e. predator avoidance) or recruitment.
We have not considered the possible impact of exotic pathogens on Norwegian salmon farming. There are a large number of potential pathogens (i.e. hazards) infecting salmonids elsewhere that could affect farmed and wild salmonids in Norway if introduced (Raynard et al., 2007; Brun and Lillehaug, 2010). Such introductions may be irreversible, and difficult or impossible to contain, and the main risk factor is the movement of live fish or fertilized eggs.
Future work
To evaluate the effects of salmon and rainbow trout farming on the infection status of wild salmonids, there is a need to increase our knowledge about the complete pathogen repertoire (viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites) present in wild fish in areas of high- and low-intensity fish farming. Long-term monitoring of selected wild populations would allow detection of changes in the infection status in the population. Experimental challenge experiments with SAV, PRV, and PMCV must be performed on juvenile Atlantic salmon and brown trout in freshwater. This would better allow a consideration of the threat posed by escaped salmon ascending rivers during fall. A more extensive genotyping of virus from wild and farmed fish would improve our understanding of both virus spread and genetic changes in pathogens that may occur in the high host density of farming areas.
Organic load and nutrients from salmon farms
The salmonid aquaculture industry has continuously restructured since 1999, with reductions in the number of farms, increased farm size and relocation of farms to deeper fjord (50–300 m) and current rich coastal aquaculture sites. During this period, the production has doubled (Gullestad et al., 2011), with typical salmon farm produces between 3000 and 5000 tons in a 18 months period in sheltered coastal waters and as much as 14 000 tons at more dynamic coastal sites. This rapid development has led to increased concerns about the environmental impacts both at present and future predicted finfish production levels.
Increased awareness of elevated discharges of nutrients, excess feed, and faeces to the marine environment has resulted in greater scrutiny of the aquaculture industry (Mente et al., 2006; Taranger et al., 2012a). To this end, the Ministry of Fisheries and Coastal Affairs have stated that “the environmental impact of aquaculture must be kept at an acceptable level and be within the assimilative capacity of the area” (Anon., 2009b).
Assessing the risk of organic enrichment and nutrient overloading of Norwegian finfish aquaculture at local and regional scales focus both on benthic and pelagic systems and is based on a combination of scientific knowledge and industry monitoring data, coupled with best professional judgment, and the precautionary principle.
Risk assessment
Release assessment
Intensive farming of finfish in open sea cages results in the release of organic and inorganic effluents (i.e. carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus) in the form of waste feed, faeces, and metabolic by-products to the surrounding aquatic environments (Holmer et al., 2005; Strain and Hargrave, 2005). At current production levels in Norway, salmonid farming (1.3 M tons cultivated fish in 2012) releases ∼34 000 tons of N, 60 000 tons of C, and 9750 tons of P annually (Taranger et al., 2013).
Expose assessment
Accumulation of these effluents into the marine system can negatively impact the ecosystem by contributing to eutrophication of pelagic systems, fertilization of benthic macrophytes in the euphotic zone, and organic enrichment of benthic systems (Strain and Hargrave, 2005). However, the area of influence (local or regional locations) and degree of enrichment of the environment depends on a number of factors including the size of the farm (i.e. the biomass of fish), the ambient environmental conditions (i.e. hydrodynamics, water depth, wave exposure, topography and substrate type) and the husbandry practices at the individual fish farms (Holmer et al., 2005). In Norway, detailed knowledge about the environmental effects of organic and nutrient enrichment from finfish aquaculture is mainly based on studies around sheltered and coastal fjord aquaculture sites.
At deep aquaculture sites, fish farming effluents can be traced into the wider environment and into benthic foodwebs up to at least 1 km from the farming site (Kutti et al., 2007b; Olsen et al., 2012). At low deposition levels, organic enrichment of benthic sediments (up to 500 m from the farming location) stimulates secondary production in soft bottom communities, resulting in shifts in benthic faunal community structure (Kutti et al., 2007a; Kutti, 2008; Bannister et al., 2014). In addition, excessive loading of organic effluents to sediments often leads to dramatic changes in biogeochemical processes leading to grossly anoxic conditions (Valdemarsen et al., 2012). The emissions of dissolved nutrients from finfish farms are quickly diluted in the water column at dynamic sites and elevated nutrient levels are hardly detected 200 m away from the farm (H. Jansen, IMR, unpublished data; Sanderson et al., 2008).
Consequence assessment
Many studies have investigated benthic impacts of fish farming on soft sediment benthic systems, demonstrating that intensive fish farming modifies biogeochemical processes (Holmer and Kristensen, 1992; Holmer and Frederiksen, 2007; Norði et al., 2011). Remineraliztion of the highly labile organic waste (i.e. fish feed and faeces) results in increased sediment oxygen demand and altered metabolic pathways, and a shift from aerobic (i.e. heterotrophic respiration) to anaerobic (i.e. sulphate reduction and methanogenesis) microbial degradation (Holmer and Kristensen, 1992; Holmer et al., 2003; Valdemarsen et al., 2009). Excessive organic enrichment can thus lead to highly modified sediment conditions (Valdemarsen et al., 2012), impacting the structure and biomass of faunal communities (Kutti et al., 2007b; Hargrave et al., 2008; Valdemarsen et al., 2010; Bannister et al., 2014). Increased release of dissolved nutrients from fish farming activities may stimulate phytoplankton growth and plankton blooms (Gowen and Ezzi, 1994) and may change the composition of seaweed communities in the littoral zone (Rueness and Fredriksen, 1991; Bokn et al., 1992; Munda, 1996; Pihl et al., 1999; Worm and Sommer, 2000; Krause-Jensen et al., 2007).
To a lesser extent, there are studies that have investigate the effects of intensive fish farming to other habitats and biota including maerl beds (Hall-Spencer et al., 2006; Sanz-Lazaro et al., 2011; Aguado-Giménez and Ruiz-Fernández, 2012), coral reefs (Bongiorni et al., 2003; Villanueva et al., 2006), seaweeds and seagrass beds (Worm and Sommer, 2000; Diaz-Almela et al., 2008; Holmer et al., 2008), megafaunal communities (Wilding et al., 2012), and pelagic and dermersal fish (Tuya et al., 2006; Fernandez-Jover et al., 2007, 2011; Dempster et al., 2011). A consensus of these studies is that if the assimilative capacities of these environments are exceeded, then impacts on individual species, habitats, and ecosystems will be pronounced.

Risk estimation
Organic loading on a local scale
On a local scale the endpoint: unacceptable change in faunal communities and sediment chemistry in the production zone is estimated. The criterion of unacceptable change is determined by Norwegian authorities and all salmon farms in Norway are monitored through mandatory investigations (MOM system; Hansen et al., 2001). The MOM-B investigations are performed regularly under and in the closest vicinity of the fish cages and are based on qualitatively determined indicators such as chemical parameters (pH and redox potential), sensory parameters, and presence and/or absence of macro-infauna. The performance of these indicators against predefined thresholds categorizes the farming locations into different environmental conditions (1. low-, 2. medium-, 3. high-organic loading, and 4. organic overloading). The environmental condition 4 represents an unacceptable state when production cannot continue before the farming location has recovered. Data from the monitoring of Norwegian salmon farms are obtained from the Norwegian Directorate of Fisheries, including 2761 electronically reported MOM-B investigations undertaken beneath Norwegian fish farms between 2009 and 2013. The percentage of farms in an unacceptable ecological state (4) has been stable and <3% the last few years (Figure 5). This is probably a result of better localization of farms. The risk of unacceptable change in sediment chemistry and fauna communities in the production zone is low. However, according to national set thresholds for management of the production zone, low impact on this scale does not reflect pristine conditions, but merely that the farm is managed within acceptable conditions in regard to its local impact.
Several rigorous scientific examinations of benthic impacts have been conducted near salmon farms in western Norway (Hordaland) where benthic carbon loadings, benthic fauna responses, and sediment biogeochemical processes were studied (Kutti et al., 2007a, b; Kutti, 2008; Valdemarsen et al., 2012; Bannister et al., 2014). In addition, there are generic scientific knowledge in respect to the flow of organic waste into benthic foodwebs along the Norwegian coast (Olsen et al., 2012).

Organic loading on a regional scale
The MOM-C system is an extended investigation of several sites (1–5) in the extended influence zone around farms and consists of quantitative measurements of the organic enrichment and the impact on biodiversity in infauna communities. The MOM-C investigations of fauna communities are following the Norwegian Standard (NS 9410) and farming sites are categorized into different environmental states (i.e. very good, good, moderate, poor, and very poor) according to nationally set thresholds (Molvær et al., 1997). Based on the hydrographical conditions around the farm a distant point should be indentified in the most likely accumulation area beyond the production zone. The ecological condition at this distant site could be used as a proxy to estimate the risk of the endpoint; significant change in bottom communities beyond the production zone (regional impact).
Data from MOM-C investigations on 122 salmon farms, which represents ∼10% of the farms currently operating in Norwegian waters, are compiled from the Norwegian Directorate of Fisheries. The data show that distant sites at 95% of the farms had a high or very high ecological classification according to national set thresholds for Shannon–Wiener diversity index (H′) (Molvær et al., 1997) while 5% was classified in moderate conditions.
To provide an estimate of risk for impact on a regional scale, data have been retained from case studies in the Hardangerfjord (Husa et al., 2014a) and regional monitoring in some other areas in Norwegian coastal waters (Vassdal et al., 2012) according to parameters and thresholds defined in the Norwegian implementation of the European Water Framework Directive (Molvær et al., 1997; WFD, 2000/60/EC; Anon., 2009a). These data show that the ecological conditions in fauna communities and oxygen values in deep regional basins are high to very high in fjords with high salmon farming activity. These findings were also supported by analysis of the relative importance of the extra contribution of organic farm waste to decomposing communities in the deep basins in the Hardangerfjord, estimating that current farming production increased oxygen consumption by 10% and decreased oxygen levels in bottom water with 0.09% (Aure, 2013). However, we do not have sufficient data from the entire Norwegian coastline to make a full risk estimation of the impact of organic loading on a regional scale.
Nutrient emissions on a local scale
Local impact from nutrients and fine particulate material in the euphotic zone are currently not monitored around Norwegian fish farms, and we therefore have no data to estimate the endpoint; nutrients from fish farms results in local eutrophication.
Nutrient emissions on a regional scale
To estimate the endpoint, nutrients from fish farms results in regional eutrophication, we do not have sufficient data from Norwegian coastal waters to fulfil a complete risk estimation. However, three years monitoring of nutrient values and chlorophyll a in the Hardangerfjord area (Husa et al., 2014b) and in Rogaland County, a sensitive area for fish farming due to lower water exchange (Vassdal et al., 2012), show that ecological conditions for these parameters are within national acceptances thresholds (Molvær et al., 1997) suggesting high or very high water quality.
These data coupled with modelling estimations on potential increase in phytoplankton production (Figure 6; Skogen et al., 2009) suggest low risk of regional impacts from aquaculture in Norway. The potential increase in phytoplankton production is based on knowledge about the water transport mechanisms, coupled with typical natural values of nitrogen and phosphorous in the Norwegian Coastal Current and the calculated extra contribution to nutrient concentrations from fish farms in each Norwegian county. Assuming that theoretically all the nitrogen released from fish farms is assimilated in phytoplankton growth, an increase in the natural phytoplankton biomass were calculated and compared with the threshold of a 50% increase in phytoplankton biomass that is defined as eutrophication by OSPAR (Anon., 2010).

Limitations
The risk assessment in the period 2010–2013 is based on a limited dataset, restricted scientific knowledge, and national monitoring methods that require upgrading/revising. On a local scale, the use of the MOM-B monitoring dataset for assessing local impacts of organic enrichment should be used cautiously. The MOM-B system is built on a qualitative assessment limited in its efficacy outside of soft sediment habitats. Using the “MOM system” to monitor the environmental effects to other benthic habitats such as hard, mixed and sandy bottom habitats, seaweed and kelp habitats, or other sensitive habitats including sponge aggregations and cold water corals reefs will lead to uncertain monitoring results. Therefore, reported benthic conditions underneath fish farms should be used cautiously in the risk assessment approach. The number of MOM-C investigations available for this risk assessment was limited to 122 fish farming sites.
Considering there are more or less 1000 fish farming locations along the Norwegian Coastline, the use of these investigations to provide an overview of the impact of organic enrichment from aquaculture within the influence area, should be approached cautiously, given they only represent ∼10% of current production sites. Scientific data are restricted to fjord habitats in western Norway, there is a dearth of scientific studies representing the different geographical settings (i.e. southern, mid, and northern Norway) and the different benthic habitat types (coastal sandy sediments, hard bottom habitats, and sensitive and vulnerable habitats).
Furthermore, at regional scales national monitoring programmes have only started to begin (from 2008); therefore, existing knowledge and data of regional impacts from fish farming are mainly restricted to two counties and limited time. These limitations result in a precautionary approach used in the above risk assessment.
Future work
To achieve the goal of the Ministry of Fisheries and Coastal Affairs that the environmental impact of aquaculture must be kept at an acceptable level and be within the assimilative capacity of the area, further scientific research and coastal monitoring efforts are needed. It is crucial that further knowledge is developed on understanding the interaction of organic and nutrient waste release on different habitat types (ca. hard bottom habitats, coastal sandy sediment habitats, and benthic boreal systems). In addition, habitats of ecological significance and sensitive species (ca. coral reefs, sponge aggregations, maerl beds, seagrass meadows, and spawning areas) require detailed investigations to understand their responses to organic and nutrient loadings, thus allowing more informed decisions on ecological impacts to be made. Furthermore, given the heterogeneity of benthic substrates along the Norwegian coastline, and the existing limitations of the MOM-B monitoring standard, improved monitoring tools need to be established to enable monitoring of local impacts from fish farms on non-soft sediment substrates. MOM-C investigations should be performed more often and at a greater number of stations along a gradient from enrichment. Furthermore, sampling for therapeutants and fatty acids should be incorporated in the MOM-C investigations to detect the pressure of drugs on the environment and also to determine if the impacts detected are in fact related to fish farming activities.
Moreover, there is also a need to develop new modelling tools that can predict the dispersal of organic and nutrient wastes from fish farms, which will enable better placement of monitoring stations for both MOM-C and regional monitoring to increase the likelyhood of detecting impacts. Finally, regional monitoring programmes should incorporate greater sampling coverage (i.e. sampling locations) and frequency along the entire Norwegian coastline. Monitoring programmes should also identify possible risk areas for regional impacts and place further emphasis on monitoring in these habitats.
Discussion
The main approach in the risk assessment on the environmental impact of fish farming in Norway was to review the state-of-the-art on various hazards and potential risk factors, review national monitoring data with relevance for the risk assessment, and score qualitatively the risk of impact in broad categories; low, moderate, and high risk of impact when monitoring data were available (Taranger et al., 2011a, b, 2012b, 2013).
When the first risk assessment of the environmental impact of Norwegian fish farming was initiated in 2010 (Taranger et al., 2011a), only very broad definitions and goals of aquaculture sustainability were presented in a strategy document by the Norwegian government (Anon., 2009b). The goals for sustainability put forward in this document are listed in Table 1, and covers the topics; diseases/parasites, genetic interactions with wild populations, pollution and discharges, marine site structure and zoning, as well as sustainability of feed and feed resources. These goal are very generic and do not specify sustainability indicators and related thresholds for societal/political acceptance of the environmental impact of fish farming in Norway.
The Institute of Marine Research in Norway and the Norwegian Veterinarian Institute were requested by the Norwegian Ministry of Fisheries and Coastal Affairs in 2011 to propose scientifically based sustainability indicators and related thresholds to score the severity of the potential environmental impacts of aquaculture. This included indicators for the risk of genetic introgression of escaped farmed salmon as well impact of salmon lice from fish farming on wild salmonid populations. As a result, indicators and suggested thresholds to score the environmental impact as low, moderate, or high were proposed in 2012 (Taranger et al., 2012a). These recommendations were in part approved and implemented into a governmental report on Norwegian seafood policy in 2013 (Anon., 2013c), and in a newly established Quality Norm for the management and protection of wild Atlantic salmon in Norway approved by the Norwegian government in late 2013 (Anon., 2013a).
As a result, the suggested indicators for environmental impact as the associated suggested thresholds for scoring of the impacts have been adopted in the most recent version of the Risk assessment of Norwegian fish farming (Taranger et al., 2014). They are the basis of the current assessment of risk of genetic introgression and impact on salmon lice on wild salmonid populations. The assessments are based on monitoring programmes on the numbers of escaped salmon in Norwegian rivers over the last 3 years, and the level of salmon lice infections on wild salmonids in Norwegian coastal waters during the last 4 years.
New scientific findings have recently emerged, such as the measured level of introgression of escaped farmed salmon into wild salmon populations in 20 Norwegian rivers (Glover et al., 2013a), and new estimates on the additional marine mortality caused by salmon lice on Atlantic salmon from the rivers Dale and Vosso, in Hordaland, Norway (Skilbrei et al., 2013; Vollset et al., 2014). Such findings assist in developing more quantitative assessments of the impact of number of escaped salmon in rivers, and the impact of salmon lice from farming on wild salmonids, respectively.
In contrast to the situation for genetic introgression and impact of salmon lice, there are very limited monitoring data on potential transfer of other diseases and parasites from salmon farming to wild fish in Norway. Hence, the assessment on the risk of disease transfers to wild fish is mainly based on an analysis of the frequency of disease outbreaks in the ∼1000 sites for salmon farming along the Norwegian coast. This is supported with a review on the knowledge of risk of disease transmission for the most relevant pathogens, and some available data on prevalence of pathogens and/or any disease outbreaks in wild Atlantic salmon and sea trout populations in Norway (Taranger et al., 2014).
Regarding the local and regional impact of organic load and release of nutrient from marine salmon farming, such environmental impact indicators and associated monitoring programmes are defined and adapted by the Norwegian fish farming authorities regarding the local zone under and close to the farms, whereas the indicators and monitoring programmes for regional effects are being implemented in some counties in Norway (Vassdal et al., 2012; Husa et al., 2014a). The local zone under and close to the farm is monitored with a risk-based frequency using the relatively simple MOM-B method, while the more sensitive MOM-C method with detailed analysis of the species compositions in soft bottom samples near the farms is only applied occasionally (Hansen et al., 2001). Both these methods have limitations, e.g. they require soft bottom, and are currently under revisions.
Data from regional monitoring has only become available in a few counties in the last years, but new programmes are starting up in several counties. The regional monitoring will to a large degree be based upon environmental indexes and environmental quality elements and related threshold for scoring of quality according to the Norwegian implementation of EUs Water Framework Directive (Anon., 2009a).
The current risk assessment of local of organic matter and nutrient release are based on the mandatory MOM-B monitoring from all farms and MOM-C analyses from a limited number of fish farms (Taranger et al., 2014). The regional impact is evaluated based on available models and some investigations in the counties of Hordaland and Rogaland which both have high salmon farming activity compared with the area of available coastal water. As discussed above under the section on impact of organic matter and nutrients, the analyses have limitations, and a more extensive and improved monitoring programme is needed both on local and regional scale.
Moreover, a range of other potential risk factors, such as use of various pharmaceuticals, transfers of xenobiotics with the feed, use of copper as antifouling agent on sea cages, interactions with fisheries and other ecological impacts of sea cage farming, as well as ecological impacts of catch, transport and use of wrasses as cleaner fish against salmon lice are discussed in the risk assessment of Norwegian fish farming (Taranger et al., 2014), but are not included in the current analysis.
Conclusions and summary of main findings
This represents the first risk assessment of cage-based salmonid aquaculture in Norway, which is world’s largest producer of farmed Atlantic salmon. While there are several limitations in the approaches used to estimate the risks, as has been discussed in the sections above, this work has provided the Norwegian authorities with a framework upon which to evaluate the most important identified hazards against environmental goals for sustainability. The primary findings from the present risk assessment can be summarized as follows:
Given the rapid expansion of open sea cage farming in Norway, and internationally, and the range of ecological impacts that either are demonstrated or suspected, there is an urgent need for better knowledge about such impacts, to implement improved monitoring programmes for the most important hazards, and also to improve procedures for risk assessments including useful environmental risk indicators and to facilitate processes that involves definitions on the societal acceptance levels of the various impacts.
Based upon the observed frequency of farmed escaped salmon on the spawning grounds of wild populations in the period 2010–2012, 21 of the 34 populations included in the risk assessment were in moderate–to-high risk of experiencing genetic changes due to introgression of farmed salmon. However, a recent study of 20 Norwegian rivers has demonstrated that there is only a moderate correlation between the observed frequency of escapees and introgression of farmed salmon (Glover et al., 2013a); therefore, validation of the level of introgression in a higher number of native populations will be required in the future.
During the period 2010–2013, salmon lice infections mainly resulting from salmon farming were estimated at a total of 109 stations covering relevant areas of the Norwegian coastline using wild sea trout as a proxy for local infection pressure on wild salmonids. Twenty-seven of these stations indicated moderate or high likelihood of mortality for wild migrating salmon smolts. For sea trout later in the season, 67 of the stations indicated moderate or high likelihood of mortality on wild sea trout.
The high frequency of the viral disease outbreaks for PD, IPN, heart and skeletal muscle inflammation, and CMS in Norwegian salmon farming suggests extensive release of the causal pathogens for these diseases in many areas. Migrating wild salmon and local sea trout are likely to be exposed to these pathogens. However, the extent of this exposure and consequences remains largely unknown. Screening of wild salmonids has revealed low to very low prevalence of the viruses SAV, IPNV, PMCV, and low prevalence of PRV in salmon. Furthermore, these viruses have never been documented to cause disease in wild Norwegian salmonids. Thus, a general lack of data prohibits complete risk estimation for these diseases.
From a total of ∼500 yearly investigations of local organic loading under fish farms, 2% of them displayed unacceptable conditions in the benthic sediments and faunal composition in 2013, whereas 11% classified with a high organic loading but still within the threshold. The remaining 87% of the farms had a moderate-to-high ecological conditions. The risk of eutrophication and organic over loading in the benthic communities beyond the production area of the farm is considered low based upon case studies and monitoring data from a limited area of the Norwegian coast.

IKON Global Innovation Centre
IKON is our new global innovation centre located in Kingscourt, Ireland. Both a place of R&D and a living research project, it asks the big questions that will lead us to a more sustainable, circular and healthy future while delivering enhanced value to our customers. . Interested in further information on our sustainability approach?
Get in touch with Bianca and her sustainability team.
Get in touch . We are conscious of the nature of the raw materials we use. We are also aware of the need to optimise energy and raw material usage, and prevent or minimise pollution and environmental damage. We believe it is a matter of social responsibility to be open and honest about the environmental impact of the manufacture of its products, and a full Environmental Profile based on Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) is recognised as the preferred tool to achieve this. The Environmental Profile certificate is available on the BRE Green Book Live website.
In 2002, we became the first insulation manufacturer to openly complete and publish an independently certified Environmental Profile on one of our product ranges. This was produced by the BRE using the BRE Environmental Profiles Methodology. This Methodology produces Green Guide Ratings which can be used to gain credits in whole building environmental assessment tools such as BREEAM. We have maintained continuous certification since our first Environmental Profile was produced and our latest certified resultsare available by following the link to Green Guide Ratings.
Sustainability issues, however, extend far beyond the confines of a company's own operations. Raw material supply chains can have an all too easy to ignore impact on a business' sustainability performance. The ultimate goal in this area is to source raw materials responsibly. The main whole building environmental assessment tool used in the UK, BREEAM, awards credits for responsible sourcing of building materials other than insulation. .
