With growing tensions in the Arctic region, the islands are…","Jenis av Rana, foreign minister of the Faroe Islands, was excited on the morning of July 22. In his 25-year-long career as a member of the Faroese Parliament for the Christian Conservative party, he occasionally met with colleagues from Iceland or Greenland or even different Scandinavian countries. But he hadn’t even been foreign minister for a year, when on that Wednesday morning he was preparing to meet U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.
Pompeo was in Copenhagen, and quite untraditionally, had decided to invite the foreign ministers of the self-governing parts of the Danish Kingdom—Greenland and the Faroes—to join him and the Danish foreign minister for a meeting. For the tiny Faroese department of foreign relations, it was the culmination of many years of work that such a high-profile U.S. official was willing to talk directly to the Faroese government.
But more than anything, the invitation was a sign of the growing strategic importance the Faroe Islands, as an Arctic nation, are beginning to have. Four months later, on Nov. 28, the tiny island group—which sells a quarter of its fish to Russia and was about to commit to a 5G agreement with the controversial Chinese telecom firm Huawei—signed a partnership declaration with the United States.
The Faroes consist of 18 small islands, inhabited by 52,000 people. The archipelago lies in the middle of the North Atlantic Ocean, at the center of the so-called GIUK-gap—a North Atlantic transit route between Greenland, Iceland, and the northern United Kingdom—which has regained the strategic importance it enjoyed during the Cold War.
As stated in the U.S. defense strategy for the region, which was released in a report to Congress in 2019, the gap has become a “strategic corridor for naval operations between the Arctic and the North Atlantic.” And with both Russia and China as competitors, the region is increasingly important for U.S. national security interests. With the Arctic ice melting, and the shipping traffic growing, the Faroe Islands are hoping to become a maritime service base for U.S. and NATO ships.
Like Greenland, which outgoing U.S. President Donald Trump announced he wanted to buy a year ago, the Faroe Islands are a self-governing part of the Danish Kingdom. The economy is primarily based on fishing and salmon farming.
An increasing U.S. diplomatic presence in the Faroes has been noted by local politicians and media in recent years. The U.S. ambassador to Denmark, Carla Sands, has been visiting the islands frequently. While it is normal for the politically appointed U.S. ambassadors in Denmark to visit the Faroese as part of their duties, the feeling in the Faroes is that Sands has had a more substantive agenda than her predecessors.
When the state-owned telecommunications company, Føroya Tele, was in negotiations with Huawei to make the Chinese company its 5G-provider, the ambassador addressed the issue directly in the Faroese newspaper, Sosialurin, urging the company to “choose an American or European firm” to make sure that it was the Faroese people, “not the Chinese government” that was in charge of deciding how the technology would influence Faroese values and society.
Sands has been vocal in her worries about the potential surveillance Huawei can do for the Chinese state, but in this op-ed she went further, and tried to spread fear that countries that let Huawei control their tele-infrastructure would be working by “communist rules.” If those rules were broken, for example by “supporting human rights demonstrations in Hong Kong,” the country could be subject to “threats, reprisals and economic sanctions.”
Sands told me that she found her role as ambassador to naturally include engagement in the Faroes to ensure trade and “people-to-people relations.” She also noted the importance of the islands to NATO security. Sands isn’t the only American suitor to visit the islands lately. In October, U.S. Admiral Robert Burke, Commander of U.S. Naval Forces Europe, visited and met with the Faroese foreign minister to discuss security in the Arctic and the possibility of cooperation with the Faroes providing services to U.S. navy ships.
Faroese foreign relations have always been synonymous with business relations. As foreign and security policies on the islands are still, legally speaking, under the Danish government’s control, Faroese leaders were historically somewhat limited to making trade and fishery agreements.
But when Denmark joined what later would become the European Union in 1972, the Faroese Parliament decided not to follow—mainly because it would mean giving up fishing rights. And the EU’s ever-growing importance for Danish politics has complicated the relationship between Denmark and the self-governing parts of the kingdom, which sometimes, like when it comes to fishing rights, have opposing interests. As the Faroe Islands aren’t part of the European single market, the islands have developed important business relations outside the union.
The archipelago’s government was one of the first in the West to reach a fishery agreement with the Soviet Union in the 1970s, and later discussed a free-trade agreement with Russia for years. Even though no agreement was reached, Russia remained a vital market for Faroese exports.
After the Ukraine crisis in 2014, tensions between the West and Russia reached a boiling point. At the peak of the disagreements, the United States and Europe implemented sanctions on Russian minerals, which led to Russia imposing boycotts on European food imports. The Faroe Islands had just faced European boycotts themselves following a fishery dispute with Norway and the European Union and had increased their export to the Russian market. Luckily for the Faroese economy, Russia did not include the islands in the boycotts, and in the coming years, exports to the Eastern giant increased.
In 2015, the Faroe Islands opened a diplomatic mission in Moscow, and in 2018, the Faroes signed a memorandum of cooperation with the Eurasian Economic Union, formalizing cooperation with Russia and its neighbors. In 2018, 27 percent of Faroese exports went to the Russian market—making the Faroes the largest fish exporter to the country—and Russia was the largest single importer of Faroese fish (European countries combined imported more Faroese fishery products) and therefore essential to the Faroese economy.
While Danish politicians have sometimes expressed concern over Faroese trade with Russia while Denmark and the EU are being partially boycotted, Denmark does not have the power to decide who the Faroes trade with. As the Faroe Islands have become increasingly independent over the last decades, the nature of the relationship with Denmark has changed. When it comes to trade, the Faroes deal with anyone they choose, and the Danish government knows that any interference with trade or fishing rights could lead to major conflicts within the kingdom.
Washington probably won’t be worried about Faroese fish exports to Russia, but will be aiming at gaining equally economic and cultural ties to the islands’ inhabitants. The Faroe Islands have embassies in Moscow and Beijing, and the Faroese foreign minister told me that Pompeo had asked, in the meeting with the foreign ministers of the Danish Kingdom, why the Faroes don’t have any diplomatic representation in the United States.
In recent years, China has also become a more important market for the Faroes than ever before. The Faroese salmon-farming giant, Bakkafrost, is currently facing problems in exporting salmon to China because of the COVID-19 pandemic, but the islands are exporting more than 20 times more salmon to China than in 2010. A free-trade agreement with the most populous country on earth is therefore something politicians and businessmen in the Faroes dream about. And when the Faroese telecom company was working on a 5G agreement with Huawei, the Chinese ambassador to Denmark apparently raised the issue with Faroese ministers.
The promise of an easier path to free trade was of course meant to be secret, but it was revealed as the Faroese minister of commerce was about to give an interview to Faroese media on another topic, but was approached by a state official from his ministry. The minister had forgotten to turn off his microphone, and his private conversation with the official, who told him that the Chinese ambassador had said in a meeting that it would be easier to achieve free trade between the countries if the telecom company signed an agreement with Huawei, was recorded.
The revelation made international news and put pressure on Faroese authorities not to make Huawei it’s 5G provider. It has since become clear that an agreement with Huawei, even though not officially ruled out, is unlikely.
The Faroese tightrope act is likely to continue as great powers show a greater interest in the islands. A recent Danish Institute for International Relations report, commissioned by the Danish Foreign Ministry, outlines the effects of the Arctic change from a “low-tension” toward a “high-tension” region. In addition to discussing the challenges that growing tensions between the superpowers in the Arctic will have on the region in general, it discusses the challenges the new political reality will have on the Arctic parts of the Danish Kingdom—Greenland and the Faroe Islands.
“Great power tension in the Arctic has two effects on the Faroe Islands,” Mikkel Runge Olesen, one of the authors of the report said. “The first one is that they are back on the map,” he explained, “but there is a negative side as well. The more interested the US becomes, the harder it will be to fly under the radar, trade with everyone, and not pick a side.”
After the meeting with Pompeo, the Faroese foreign minister was satisfied. He had prepared to talk about formalizing trade and cooperation between the United States and the Faroe Islands and was positively surprised by the effectiveness of the meeting; officials from both countries had already started working on the agreement that was formalized last month. Apart from stating that the parties of the agreement want to strengthen cooperation in science, culture, and business, the agreement also acknowledges “common strategic and economic interests in the North Atlantic.”
For the United States, this will perhaps be seen as a victory in establishing its presence and maybe for the immediate future ruling out Chinese influence in a place that trades with everyone. The agreement has not received a lot of attention in the Danish media, but one can imagine that Danish politicians are happy as well. While the agreement was signed by Faroese and U.S. officials, American diplomats must have informed the Danes of what was going on. And while a memorandum with the Eurasian Economic Union does not align with Danish foreign policy, Faroese partnership with the U.S. government does.
Faroese politicians are aware of the increased relevance the tiny island group is beginning to have. When I talked to the Faroese foreign minister in August, he expressed happiness over the superpower suitors.
“We have often been told that we have been insignificant in recent years after our geographical location lost importance when tensions in the region disappeared,” Rana explained. “We have had problems reaching out to other nations, and therefore the current situation is welcomed … Some nations have natural resources, but our location is a resource for us.”",,Regin Winther Poulsen,Morning Brief|Argument|Argument|Report|Report|Argument|Dispatch,,2020-12-07,Foreign Policy

The Arctic's unique nature is still relatively undisturbed. It is very rich in resources such as hydrocarbons and fish stocks. However, it is under intensifying pressure from pollution, climate change and unsustainable development. It is vitally important that increasing economic development such as hydrocarbon exploitation and new shipping routes takes fully into account the preservation of this unique and highly vulnerable environment. Some four million people live in the Arctic region including nearly half a million EU citizens.
Three EU Member States - Denmark (Greenland), Finland and Sweden — have territories in the Arctic. Two other Arctic states - Iceland and Norway - are members of the European Economic Area. Canada, Russia and the United States are strategic partners of the EU. European Arctic areas are a priority in the Northern Dimension policy. Beyond areas of national jurisdiction, the Arctic Ocean contains parts pertaining to the high seas and the seabed managed by the International Seabed Authority.
The EU is a party to the Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-west Atlantic (OSPAR) which covers about one-third of the Arctic Ocean up to the North Pole. Many other multilateral environmental agreements apply to the Arctic to some extent (where Arctic States are parties). The European Union's application to become a Permanent Observer on the Arctic Council was received affirmatively by the Kiruna ministerial (May 2013) but the final decision on implementation is still pending. The EU is a member of the Barents Euro-Arctic Council (BEAC).
The Arctic is a key driver of the world ocean and climate system and plays a vitally important part in many other environmental issues. The impact of climate change on the Arctic is already evident. Continuation of these trends would have profound consequences both for the Arctic and the global environment.
Key issues include:
Long range transport of pollution - the Arctic is a global sink for contaminants discharged from industry, energy production, agriculture and other human activities. Persistent organic pollutants and mercury are of special concern. Contaminants are concentrated in the thick fat tissues that Arctic animals need for insulation and energy reserve, and which are consumed by humans.
Biodiversity - some ecosystems and species are clearly put at risk; maybe most clearly the hundreds of endemic species specially adapted for life on the sea ice. Many migrating species from Europe depend on the high productivity of the Arctic ecosystems in summer for foraging and reproduction: birds, whales, fish – some of them commercially harvested with high economic value.
Environmental impacts of economic development – increasing oil, gas and mineral exploration, shipping and tourism puts pressure on the vulnerable Arctic environment. It is essential to have clear and effective policies in place to manage these risks.
Knowledge and understanding of the Arctic environment – the EU is making a major contribution to research, monitoring and assessment of Arctic environmental issues and trends through funding of projects under the EU Research Framework Programmes and through the assessments that were carried out by the European Environment Agency.
The EU role
The EU is committed to working with the Arctic States, local communities and other stakeholders to address these environmental challenges. In 2016, the Commission and the High Representative published a Joint Communication on an integrated EU policy for the Arctic structured around three priorities, namely:
An update to the 2016 EU Arctic Communication is foreseen for 2021.
In addition, the Arctic was also identified as a priority in other strategic documents such as the EU Global Strategy and the 7th Environmental Action Programme.
In 2010, DG Environment funded a study to assess the EU's environmental footprint on the Arctic and to assess policy options to reduce the footprint. Details of the study can be found here. An update of this work is underway as part of an ongoing study into the EU’s impact on the Arctic (due for completion in 2021).

- The Arctic used to be white but now it's turning blue, and absorbing more heat in a feedback loop.
We've all seen the pictures: a forlorn polar bear stranded on an ice floe - the living symbol of global warming melting the ice caps.
We worry for the polar bears, but most of us are unaware that Arctic melting could be just as dangerous for us.
""What happens in the Arctic does not stay there,"" Gail Whiteman, Director of the Pentland Centre for Sustainability at Lancaster University told Davos 2020.
""What's at stake in the Arctic is actually the future of humanity itself.""
Here are extracts from Professor Whiteman's introduction to the discussion What's at stake: the Arctic:
Earth's circulation system
The Arctic is an incredibly important system in the global climate system. So just like the Amazon is the lungs of the world, the Arctic is like our circulation system and feeds in to global climate change everywhere.
Science also tells us that the Arctic is in crisis. We know based on observational data that we have lost 50% of Arctic ice in about 50 years.
Albedo effect
So just when the World Economic Forum was starting the Arctic was very white and over that time period it is increasingly blue. Now, why would we care? Well, we care because of the 'albedo effect'.
And that is the thing in climate science where if something is white, it bounces off sunlight back out into the atmosphere and it doesn't absorb.
As the Arctic Ocean and the glaciers have melted we see that dark blue is absorbing more and more heat which is feeding through the rest of the system...
Since the 1970s, we have lost 75% of the volume of Arctic summer sea ice.
If you think of that as the insurance policy for the rest of the world to prevent catastrophic runaway climate change we are in trouble...
Permafrost and methane
And then we can see that the permafrost is thawing. Now, permafrost, of course, releases methane which is a concentrated [greenhouse] gas.
And if all the permafrost in the Arctic is released that is like adding in the CO2 emissions of all EU countries...
Extreme weather
If we take a look at extreme weather we can see that the Arctic plays a key point. Now, certainly the Arctic had its own fires. We saw that in Siberia. We see that in various parts.
But on top of that because of the way the Arctic affects the jet stream, it affects crazy weather all throughout the middle latitudes.
So if you remember the Sonoma fires of last year that is related to the Arctic change because of how it affects the jet stream.
If we take a look at Australia the Arctic does not have a direct correlation with those fires.
But indirectly, because we are driving global climate change because of the loss of the albedo effect that will affect things like severe weather and fires everywhere.
It's not just fires. It's also the hurricanes. It's the polar vortex coming down through Europe and North America.
Sea levels
On top of that, though, we can see that with the Greenland ice sheet, we are accelerating sea level rise.
If we get to a 2 degree warmer world we can see from some of the major cities around the world including Tokyo and New York, that they will indeed be flooded.
If we stay at the 1.5 Paris aspirational target we will save the Arctic summer sea ice.
Two degrees is not safe; 1.5 definitely is.
So from a scientific perspective, from my perspective, the Arctic is a barometer of global risk.
What happens in the Arctic does not stay there.
And what's at stake is not a geopolitical question alone or the short term economic benefits from shipping or extraction. What's at stake in the Arctic is actually the future of humanity itself.",,Robin Pomeroy,Arctic,World Economic Forum|WEF|Davos|Klaus Schwab|globalization|globalization4.0|globalization4|globalization four|what does globalization mean?,2020-01-23,World Economic Forum

For immediate release: Monday, May 21, 2012
Boston, MA — Environmental scientists at Harvard have discovered that the Arctic accumulation of mercury, a toxic element, is caused by both atmospheric forces and the flow of circumpolar rivers that carry the element north into the Arctic Ocean.
While the atmospheric source was previously recognized, it now appears that twice as much mercury actually comes from the rivers.
The revelation implies that concentrations of the toxin may further increase as climate change continues to modify the region’s hydrological cycle and release mercury from warming Arctic soils.
“The Arctic is a unique environment because it’s so remote from most anthropogenic (human-influenced) sources of mercury, yet we know that the concentrations of mercury in Arctic marine mammals are among the highest in the world,” says lead author Jenny A. Fisher, a postdoctoral fellow in Harvard’s Atmospheric Chemistry Modeling Group and the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences (EPS). “This is dangerous to both marine life and humans. The question from a scientific standpoint is, where does that mercury come from?”
The results of the study, which was led jointly by Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS) and Harvard School of Public Health (HSPH), have been published in the journal Nature Geoscience on May 20.
Mercury is a naturally occurring element that has been enriched in the environment by human activities such as coal combustion and mining. When converted to methylmercury by microbial processes in the ocean, it can accumulate in fish and wildlife at concentrations up to a million times higher than the levels found in the environment.
“In humans, mercury is a potent neurotoxin,” explains co-principal investigator [[Elsie Sunderland]], Mark and Catherine Winkler Assistant Professor of Aquatic Science at HSPH. “It can cause long-term developmental delays in exposed children and impair cardiovascular health in adults.”
Mercury is considered a persistent bioaccumulative toxin because it remains in the environment without breaking down; as it travels up the food chain, from plankton to fish, to marine mammals and humans, it becomes more concentrated and more dangerous.
“Indigenous people in the Arctic are particularly susceptible to the effects of methylmercury exposure because they consume large amounts of fish and marine mammals as part of their traditional diet,” Sunderland says. “Understanding the sources of mercury to the Arctic Ocean and how these levels are expected to change in the future is therefore key to protecting the health of northern populations.”
Sunderland supervised the study with Daniel Jacob, Vasco McCoy Family Professor of Atmospheric Chemistry and Environmental Engineering at SEAS, where Sunderland is also an affiliate.
Mercury enters the Earth’s atmosphere through emissions from coal combustion, waste incineration, and mining. Once airborne, it can drift in the atmosphere for up to a year, until chemical processes make it soluble and it falls back to the ground in rain or snow. This deposition is spread worldwide, and much of the mercury deposited to Arctic snow and ice is re-emitted to the atmosphere, which limits the impact on the Arctic Ocean.
“That’s why these river sources are so important,” says Fisher. “The mercury is going straight into the ocean.”
The most important rivers flowing to the Arctic Ocean are in Siberia: the Lena, the Ob, and the Yenisei. These are three of the 10 largest rivers in the world, and together they account for 10% of all freshwater discharge to the world’s oceans. The Arctic Ocean is shallow and stratified, which increases its sensitivity to input from rivers.
Previous measurements had shown that the levels of mercury in the Arctic lower atmosphere fluctuate over the course of a year, increasing sharply from spring to summer. Jacob, Sunderland, and their team used a sophisticated model (GEOS-Chem) of the conditions in the Arctic Ocean and atmosphere to investigate whether variables like melting ice, interactions with microbes, or the amount of sunlight (which affects chemical reactions) could account for the difference.
Incorporating those variables, however, was not enough.
The GEOS-Chem model, which is backed by rigorous environmental observations and more than a decade of scientific review, quantifies the complex nuances of the ocean-ice-atmosphere environment. It takes into account, for example, ocean mixing at various depths, the chemistry of mercury in the ocean and the atmosphere, and the mechanisms of atmospheric deposition and re-emission.
When the Harvard team adapted it for their Arctic mercury simulations, the only adjustment that could explain the spike in summertime concentrations was the incorporation of a large source to the Arctic Ocean from circumpolar rivers. This source had not been recognized previously.
As it turns out, approximately twice as much mercury in the Arctic Ocean originates from the rivers as from the atmosphere.
“At this point we can only speculate as to how the mercury enters the river systems, but it appears that climate change may play a large role,” says Jacob. “As global temperatures rise, we begin to see areas of permafrost thawing and releasing mercury that was locked in the soil; we also see the hydrological cycle changing, increasing the amount of runoff from precipitation that enters the rivers.”
“Another contributing factor,” he adds, “could be runoff from gold, silver, and mercury mines in Siberia, which may be polluting the water nearby. We know next to nothing about these pollution sources.”
As the contaminated river water flows into the Arctic Ocean, Jacob says, the surface layer of the ocean becomes supersaturated, leading to what scientists call an “evasion” of mercury from the ocean into the lower atmosphere.
“Observing that telltale supersaturation, and wanting to explain it, is what initially motivated this study,” says Fisher. “Relating it to Arctic rivers was detective work. The environmental implications of this finding are huge. It means, for example, that climate change could have a very large impact on Arctic mercury, larger than the impact of controlling emissions to the atmosphere. More work is needed now to measure the mercury discharged by rivers and to determine its origin.”
Fisher, Jacob, and Sunderland were joined on this work by co-authors Anne L. Soerensen, a research fellow at SEAS and HSPH; Helen M. Amos, a graduate student in EPS; and Alexandra Steffen, an atmospheric mercury specialist at Environment Canada.
The work was supported by the National Science Foundation’s Arctic System Science Program.

Outdated facilities, lack of resources and limited ecofreindly options are all contributing to challenging waste-management conditions in Arctic Canada, says a report released on Tuesday.
To do the report, Oceans North, a charitable organization focused on marine conservation, looked at waste data from the last 25 years in each of Canada’s four Inuit regions: the Inuvialuit Settlement Region in the Northwest Territories; the eastern Arctic territory of Nunavut; Nunavik in northern Quebec; and Nunatsiavut, in the Atlantic province of Newfoundland and Labrador.
“For the communities of Inuit Nunangat, many of which continue to engage in subsistence hunting and fishing, this issue is not only about unequal access to the waste management infrastructure that southern Canadians take for granted; it is a critical part of reconciliation with Inuit communities,” the report said.
The report found that while Arctic communities don’t produce more waste than comparable municipalities in southern Canada, their remote locations mean they have little access to the kinds of services and infrastructure that would allow them to better handle it.
“This report outlines why it is high time a new framework was built by and for Inuit,” said Natan Obed, the president of Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, Canada’s national Inuit organization.
“The gaps in municipal-level capacity to address needed upgrades to entirely inadequate waste management and infrastructure deficits in our 51 communities have direct impacts on the health of our families,” Obed said in a news release.
Waste issues absent from most Arctic discussions
Most Arctic Canadian communities were incorporated into municipalities by the mid-1980s and became responsible for managing local waste. Most of the dumps created during that period are still in use today, far exceeding their intended lifespans. They’re also often located near coastlines which can case marine pollution.
The report says despite the increasing focus on Arctic environmental protection, waste management often goes unmentioned, including in Canada’s Arctic Policy Framework released in 2019.
“It’s totally unacceptable that in such a huge part of our country, especially a place where we’re trying to do better in terms of reconciliation and environmental protection, that waste should be left out that discussion,” Susanna Fuller, vice-president of operations and projects at Oceans North, said in a phone interview.
“If it continues to not be part of the Arctic Policy Framework it’s a real lost opportunity but it’s also slightly embarrassing for Canada as a country that’s trying to lead internationally on waste reduction. It’s unacceptable to leave the Arctic out of those discussions.”
Examples from other northern regions
A new framework would do more than just help the environment, it could also contribute to greater community health as well as create jobs through things like local training, the report says.
Besides looking at at different local strategies in Canada, looking to other northern regions ranging from Alaska to the Nordic countries, could also help make up for lost time.
Greenland, like Arctic Canada, is made up of remote, fly-in communities with small populations, but has initiated several successful waste reduction strategies.
In western Greenland, 99 per cent of plastic and glass bottles gets returned to recycling plants, the report says. In addition, a compacting program has been put in place that reduces the volume of waste, something that lowers the cost of transport.
Local initiatives with buy-in from the community are important to future waste management policy in the North. Here are some examples from the report released Tuesday:
- Consignment stores in Iqaluit and Baker Lake, Nunavut
- plastic bag ban in Nain, Nunatsiavut
- Swap shops and thrift stores in Whitehorse, Yukon and Yellowknife, Northwest Territories

Besides policy reforms, the private sector also has a role to play, the report says. Bulk purchasing that would allow consumers in the North to refill containers at their local co-ops, is one example, along with favouring laundry pods instead big plastic jugs for detergent.
“There’s no one answer,” Fuller said. “That’s why in the report we pulled out examples from many different places. Because when it comes to waste management, it has to be a number of things, over a number of years, on a number of scales, in addition to how we think of waste on a daily basis.”

Arctic and Antarctic Sea Ice: How Are They Different?
We often get questions from readers about Earth’s sea ice in the Arctic and the Antarctic, and the differences between those areas. Arctic sea ice has declined over the past five decades, while Antarctic sea ice has increased, and then declined. Why do they behave differently?
How They’re Different
The primary difference between the Arctic and Antarctica is geographical. The Arctic is an ocean, covered by a thin layer of perennial sea ice and surrounded by land. (""Perennial"" refers to the oldest and thickest sea ice.) Antarctica, on the other hand, is a continent, covered by a very thick ice cap and surrounded by a rim of sea ice and the Southern Ocean.
The Arctic Ocean is very deep and closely linked with the climate systems around it, making it more sensitive to climate changes than Antarctica.
During the centuries of human exploration in the Arctic, sea ice covered the Arctic Ocean well year-round, up until recent decades. But satellite observations show that Arctic sea ice has been declining in extent*, thickness and volume since 1979.1 Average Arctic sea ice extent is at its lowest since 1850.
During the summer melt season, the sea ice’s edge retreats toward the North Pole, only to re-grow during the Arctic winter. As a result of ongoing warming driven by human activities, the trend toward summer sea ice loss (from July to September, followed by a winter re-growth) continues.
Recent research suggests that there is a relationship between Arctic sea ice losses and the human burning of fossil fuels in all months.2 Aerosols (tiny particles suspended in the atmosphere) tied to human activities have offset some of the Arctic sea ice extent loss trend; a reduction in aerosol pollution will likely see a sea ice loss acceleration.3 Ice loss at the sea ice’s margins** results in winds driving warmer water beneath the Arctic sea ice, increasing the amount of heat the Arctic Ocean stores 4 and priming conditions for further sea ice loss.
A figure showing current Arctic sea ice extent can be found here.
Antarctic Sea Ice
Antarctic sea ice expands during the winter, only to melt back largely to the continent’s edge in summer.
Antarctic sea ice extent is currently below the long-term average of all decades prior since 1979. Previously, Antarctic sea ice extent had been above that long-term average due to long-term, large-scale wind circulation patterns that drove sea ice away from Antarctica5, making room for more sea ice to form nearer to the continent.6 Climate models, or computer simulations that incorporate all the factors that affect Earth’s climate, predicted this behavior.7 These long-term wind patterns reversed several years ago, resulting in a significant sea ice decline surrounding Antarctica. Values since then have been hovering around the average of all years prior in the satellite record. A figure showing current Antarctic sea ice extent can be found here.
Why Sea Ice Matters
Some of the questions we receive ask why we should care about the polar regions. These regions are very important in regulating global temperature. Because sea ice has a bright surface, 50-70 percent of incoming energy is reflected back into space. As sea ice melts in the summer, it exposes the dark ocean surface. Instead of reflecting 50-70 percent of the sunlight, it absorbs 90 percent of the sunlight. As the ocean warms, global temperatures rise further.
Also, what happens in the polar regions doesn’t stay in those regions. Their changes affect global temperatures and can even change ocean circulation. Earth’s sea ice is very attuned and responsive to even small changes in global surface and ocean temperatures.

The Arctic remains a relatively untouched slice of planet Earth, but northern jurisdictions are eager for miners to explore.
The Arctic is a harsh and unforgiving environment; whether it’s the weather conditions, darkness or isolation, it’s a region that hasn’t seen much human activity relative to the rest of the world.
Seven nations have territory north of the Arctic Circle: Canada, the US, Russia, Finland, Sweden, Norway and, through its enduring ownership of Greenland, Denmark. Iceland is also regarded as an arctic nation despite not having any territory within the circle, and China has declared itself a “near Arctic state” — whatever that means.
The Arctic provides many opportunities by way of its historical resistance to human interference: It’s relatively untouched, and its changing climate means there are new opportunities to pursue in transportation, exploration and discovery — especially in the mineral resources space.
The Investing News Network (INN) reached out to representatives from three jurisdictions in North America for their thoughts on the mining industry in the Arctic north, and what sets the region — especially the harshest parts of the region — apart from the rest of the world.
Mining in the Arctic: Opportunities in the north
When asked what sets the Arctic apart from the rest of the world when it comes to the mineral resources industry, the common theme among the experts was exploration, or rather lack of exploration.
“The environment is a little more challenging to work in,” said Paul Budkewitsch, who is a manager of mineral resources with the Government of Nunavut.
He said that the cold winters and a shorter summer season mean that exploration is limited.
“But that’s exactly the reason why it’s an area that’s been underexplored compared to many other parts of the world, so there’s a great potential that’s yet to be fully discovered or fully outlined in Nunavut.
“With that in mind, these are relatively young districts as well, so I think the future for potential growth or continuity is quite high as well. We’re not looking at the end of a mining industry in Nunavut; rather we’re looking at the beginnings of a mining industry.”
Representatives of the Mineral License and Safety Authority of Greenland said the same, noting that the lack of exploration means there is more opportunity for new discovery.
“Greenland is generally not well explored, which brings great opportunities for companies looking for new areas to discover,” they said.
The same can be said for the Northwest Territories of Canada.
“(The Northwest Territories is) a big region — the third largest region in Canada, and with that comes a number of geological provinces and commodities,” said Pamela Stand, who oversees minerals and petroleum resources as assistant deputy minister with the Government of the Northwest Territories.
Mining in the Arctic: Existing development
So what is in the north? Quite a bit when it comes to deposits, but very little in terms of active mines. Greenland is home to two operating mines (anorthosite and ruby), with another two (zinc and rare earths) in development. Nunavut has three gold mines and an iron mine, while the Northwest Territories has three diamond mines and a tungsten mine on care and maintenance.
The representatives from Greenland, Nunavut and the Northwest Territories all talked up the pro-mining bent of their jurisdictions. So what about these three jurisdictions? Why are they of note today?
As shown by US President Donald Trump and his unrequited interest in buying Greenland, the Arctic has been drawing more political attention as the world turns to underexplored regions with unrealized potential. While Trump’s team may have spun the president’s interest in the country primarily as a strategic and geopolitical one, it also mentioned resources.
Around the Arctic, nations with interests under the ice are putting more money into developing regions that have so far withstood much human interference, like in Norway, where the government gave the go ahead to the Nussir copper mine, well within the Arctic Circle.
Bogeyman of the west, Russia, has the attention of other Arctic nations, with an expanded icebreaker fleet, new military bases, undersea exploration programs and high hopes for the northeast passage connecting Murmansk to Vladivostok through the Arctic Ocean. Its major nickel-producing region around the city of Norilsk is also within the Arctic Circle.
Yet for the most part, the arctic section of North America remains undeveloped and underpopulated, with little infrastructure and low populations.
“I think that our isolation is an advantage, because we’ve got more unexplored potential up here than some of the southern jurisdictions in Canada where people have easier access,” said Strand.
Strand also talked about the low population of the Northwest Territories, which is home to less than 45,000 people — around half of whom live in the capital, Yellowknife.
Despite the relative workforce shortage, Strand said that the three active diamond mines in the territory have high levels of local employment as mandated by the government. “(However,) there’s always a need to train more residents to work at the mines.”
He continued, “Our first priority is to train Northwest Territories residents to work in the sector, but, yes, we do have a fly-in fly-out (FIFO) workforce. With that being said, we do work with our producers to maximize northern and northern indigenous employment. It’s a very key project for us with any project that moves forward.”
For Nunavut, with similar issues around a low population (under 37,000) and isolation, Budkewitsch said that FIFO workers are too expensive.
“A lot of the industry makes very strong efforts to hire locally as much as possible,” he said. “They’ve all stated quite clearly that it’s very expensive to bring workers from the south up, and the more local people they can hire the better, so there’s a large effort that’s going on both by industry and by government to train people to these new kinds of jobs.”
Mining in the Arctic: Challenges in geography and infrastructure
For Greenland and Nunavut, geography works to limit the disadvantages of isolation, as both jurisdictions have ample access to the sea.
“Most of the ice-free areas are easily accessible by deep-water fjords, which makes shipping easy,” said the Mineral License and Safety Authority.
Budkewitsch said that, with most of Canada’s coastline in Nunavut, shipping is the way to go.
“Most of our communities are situated — with relatively few exceptions — near the coast or on the coast, so shipping is how we do get the bulk of our goods in and out.”
Generally, a lack of infrastructure is a challenge, though. Ships can only access the area when the ocean isn’t completely frozen over, as icebreakers operate in the spring when the ice is already breaking up.
The Greenland authorities said seasonal variations can limit some parts of Greenland to one to two months of clear access.
“Seasonal limitations highly depend on where in Greenland companies are operating. Some areas have mild winters whereas other areas have harsh winters with lots of snow and very low temperatures. The amount of ice at sea can limit shipping opportunities where the north of Greenland can only be accessed from the seaside one to two months a year whereas the southern part can be accessed year round.”
Inland Greenland is a kilometers-thick ice sheet, so ocean-bound travel is all that’s required. However, in the Northwest Territories, as in Nunavut — infrastructure is needed.
“There really isn’t much infrastructure in the north, so that puts a little bit of effort on the side of the companies that are doing the development to invest in those parts as well,” said Budkewitsch.
“We can’t really plug in to an electrical system or a road system like you can down south, so in the more developed areas of Canada it’s easier to do that. In Nunavut it takes a lot of effort and a lot of planning to build in those support structures to be able to conduct business and develop a mine.”
The investment is worth the trouble, though, he added, and Strand said the same for the Northwest Territories.
“We definitely have challenges — we do need infrastructure, we need energy … (but) it hasn’t stopped mines from producing, and our three diamond mines are world-class examples of how you can mitigate impacts to the environment with mitigative measures that all get approved in an independent regulatory environment.”
Mining in the Arctic: Climate change
Speaking of the environment, INN asked how climate change plays into the development of the north, with Budkewitsch noting that it is a challenge in development everywhere.
“One of the things that it’s requiring, or bringing to the front of everyone’s mind in terms of planning and long-term site monitoring, is the future uncertainties are much larger … (and the) range of weather patterns are much wider than previously anticipated, so bigger contingencies need to be built into these things, and that’s probably a good thing to do anyway.”
A clear advantage for a region like Nunavut is longer ice-free seasons, but Budkewitsch said that many problems around climate change are longer term, and in the short term attention is focused on infrastructure and the challenges of building on permafrost that is melting.
Strand said that climate change could have a similar effect on shipping for the Northwest Territories.
Also in the Northwest Territories, climate change throws up major problems with existing infrastructure in winter roads — or ice roads.
“There’s a lot of pressure on the winter road system because of the warming climate and shortening season,” said Wally Schumann, who is the Northwest Territories’ minister of infrastructure.
“The ice isn’t as thick; they need to spend more money to thicken up the road to bring it up to safety standards. These are all challenging things around climate change for (miners) and ourselves too, because we have a number of winter roads ourselves that service a number of communities.”
Many of the challenges facing the Northwest Territories are the same as those in the rest of Arctic Canada.
“The challenges for us around the natural environment changing (are that) a lot of our infrastructure was built based on the permafrost under the ground, so we have shifting of buildings, our roads are being shifted dramatically, and we’ve got to spend a lot of money on bringing them back up to safety standards just because of this melting permafrost.”
Schumann stressed that for that part of the world, warming seasons aren’t something on the horizon, but something the territory is facing now, bringing along with it the infrastructure challenges mentioned above as well as coastal flooding concerns.
To address the issue, the Northwest Territories have the 2030 climate change strategic framework detailing the government’s approach.
For Greenland, the Mineral License and Safety Authority said that, while climate change isn’t within the department’s mandate, the autonomous territory could well benefit from higher temperatures.
“Climate change will impact the fishing industry that is Greenland’s main industry. Higher sea temperatures can bring new species and a greater amount of fish as the fish are moving further north. The farming industry in South Greenland could also benefit from higher temperatures.”
Mining in the Arctic: The future of the north
Each of the Arctic jurisdictions aren’t going anywhere as more attention is turned to the mineral resources available. Rather, climate change will draw interest from all sections of business, development and society overall — as evidenced by the Trump-Greenland sales pitch.

Not just because it’s home to the iconic polar bear, and four million people, but also because it helps keep our world’s climate in balance.
Arctic sea ice acts as a huge white reflector at the top of the planet, bouncing some of the sun’s rays back into space, helping keep the Earth at an even temperature.
But man-made climate change means the Arctic has warmed over the past few decades – actually about twice as much as the global average.
As the sea ice melts there’s less to reflect the rays, and more heat is absorbed by the ocean, magnifying the warming effect.
The Arctic also helps circulate the world's ocean currents, moving cold and warm water around the globe.
We need your help to tackle climate change, and to safeguard the Arctic from its worst effects.

We’re helping Arctic animals adapt to a rapidly changing climate
When you see the Arctic on TV, its frozen seas and vast expanses of ice and snow look like they belong on another planet.
But the damage climate change is causing to the region could have catastrophic consequences much closer to home.
What’s at stake?
As the Earth warms up, melting Arctic ice will lead to rising sea levels, which will play havoc with our coasts.
And global warming in the Arctic may release huge reserves of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas.
These could speed up the effects of climate change everywhere if they’re released.
What happens in the Arctic directly affects the rest of the planet. That’s one reason why we’ve made protecting this amazing place, and the animals that make it their home, a priority.
The story so far
We’ve been active in the Arctic for decades.
Back in 1973, we helped convince the five governments of the region to sign a treaty to protect polar bears.
Controls on hunting were so successful that 10 years later the number of bears in Norway had doubled. And in 1974, WWF worked with the Greenland.
We’ve highlighted some of the most compelling stories of climate change to emerge from the Arctic, from Greenland’s melting ice sheet, to a new ocean emerging from the frozen cocoon of Arctic sea ice.
At the same time we’re protecting unique habitats and wildlife, such as polar bears, walruses and bowhead whales. More than 350,000 sq km of the Arctic is now protected from threats such as mining and oil drilling.
Did you know?
Polar bears are so well insulated that they have to move slowly to avoid overheating.
Facts and stats
- >10% - rate at which summer sea ice is disappearing per decade, threatening species like polar bears
- ¼ - estimated proportion of the world’s untapped oil and gas reserves found in the Arctic. As the ice moves out, oil companies are moving in.
- 25,000 – polar bears in the wild today
What next?
Today, climate change is the biggest threat facing the Arctic and its wildlife. Polar bears, for example, depend on summer sea ice to hunt seals. As the Earth heats up and the ice disappears, scientists estimate that two-thirds of polar bears could be wiped out by 2050.
We’re researching how climate change is affecting Arctic ecosystems, and how we can help them adapt and survive. Our research into the effects of warming in the Arctic is also helping to influence international action on climate change.
We’re also supporting research on climate change and work with communities living in the Arctic, to help people get to grips with reality of climate change and its local and global effects.
At the same time, we’re working with governments and companies to reduce their impact on the Arctic. We need to give Arctic animals both the time and space to adapt.
WWF in action
“Species like polar bears represent the Arctic ecosystem, which is responsible for moderating global climate,” says Geoff York, who co-ordinates our work on polar bears and other Arctic species.
“Conserving these species and their habitat protects us from a warming climate. Arctic species are also a critically important aspect of indigenous cultures essential to the food security of those living in the region.
“Recently, WWF successfully lobbied Arctic governments to recognize climate change as the primary threat to the survival of the polar bear. These governments are now responsible for taking a lead on reducing global greenhouse gas emissions. They have publicly committed to the conservation of a species that depends on it.”

James McConville detailed a few elements on how the Army would ramp up its capability in the Arctic prior to the public release of its strategy for the region.,"WASHINGTON — U.S. Army Chief of Staff Gen. James McConville teased a virtual audience by discussing the recently completed Arctic strategy and emphasizing it would provide the U.S. with capabilities to compete and deter conflict in the region.
The Army’s strategy recognizes “where our national interests are,” McConville said during an Association of the U.S. Army virtual event on Jan. 19, “and we certainly have and share national interests up in the Arctic.”
The “situation” is changing in the Arctic, he said, “and there’s more freedom of movement. We certainly want to make sure we protect our interests there and what we are doing in the Army and, certainly, as we look at Alaska, which sits in a very prominent place in the Arctic, we want to have the appropriate capabilities offered from the Army so that we can protect those interests.”
Those capabilities include transforming a two-star headquarters into an operational headquarters, McConville said.
The Army is looking at establishing a multidomain task force in the region as well as an Arctic-capable brigade, he added.
The Army’s only operational MDTF is based in the Indo-Pacific Region, but the service is on its way — albeit more slowly — to stand one up in the European theater.
The task force in the Pacific has worked for several years to help validate the Army’s Multidomain Operations (MDO) war-fighting concept as the service transforms it into doctrine.
The Army follows the Navy and the Air Force in coming out with Arctic strategies, which have been released over the past two years.
U.S. Northern Command leadership in recent years has said the Arctic — as it warms — means the Arctic is the first line of defense of the U.S. homeland.
The Arctic is receding at a rate of about 13 percent per decade giving way for more activity from friends and foes of the U.S.
Russian forces have long projected power and continue to build out the world’s largest icebreaker fleet and have been building air bases and sea ports to house weapons and other operational capabilities.
And China has also increased its presence and desire to operate in the Arctic, vying for natural resources in the region as well as trade routes opening up as the ice melts.
Defense officials have been spending more money on training and capability for the cold, harsh Arctic climate. Congressional appropriators provided $100 million for the U.S. North Warning System in the fiscal 2021 defense spending bill and is requiring the Pentagon to provide a report on the status of the system to include its operational integrity and what technology is used by the system compared to technology necessary to detect current and anticipated threats, particularly cruise missiles. The North Warning System is a joint U.S. and Canadian early-warning radar system for North American air defense.
The bill also requires the Defense Department to come up with a plan to modernize capability to defend the homeland against cruise missiles including the modernization of the North Warning System.
Appropriators also injected cash into a variety of Army cold-weather pursuits in the FY21 bill.
Lawmakers added $8.25 million more above the FY21 Army budget request to expedite a Family of Cold Weather Vehicles and required a report on current capabilities for arctic overland mobility capabilities.
Additionally, appropriators added $10 million for counter-unmanned aircraft technology for arctic environments, $8 million for rapid entry and sustainment capability for the region, $2 million for visual and tactic arctic reconnaissance and $1 million for sub-surface infrastructure in arctic environments. Another $50 million was added to develop arctic communications technology development.
The Army, in its FY21 budget request, kicked off a new-start effort for Cold-weather All-Terrain Vehicle -- or CATV -- but only budgeted for $1 million with funding to ramp up in subsequent years as the program progresses.

By mid-century, a Transpolar Passage will open across the Arctic Ocean via the North Pole. Few countries are preparing for this reality except China.
I recently attended (via teleconference, to cut down on travel time and emissions!) a meeting on future maritime trade flows at the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)’s International Transport Forum. One session focused exclusively on the Northern Sea Route, the shipping route along Russia’s north coast that has sat at the center of discussions on Arctic development for the better part of two decades now.
Due to Chatham House rules, I can’t quote anyone who spoke in the workshop. I can say, however, that during the session, it quickly became clear that talk of the Northern Sea Route’s potential was starting to seem passé in the face of rapid climate change in the Arctic. The shrinking and thinning of sea ice is happening faster than scientists thought possible – so fast that now, it’s not just the Northern Sea Route or even the Northwest Passage that people are talking about. They’re talking about a trans-Arctic passage cutting straight across the North Pole.
As climate change accelerates and the Arctic Ocean reluctantly exchanges its year-round ice cap for merely seasonal cover, a transpolar passage is likely to open up by mid-century, if not sooner. If Arctic sea ice disappears even for just one summer, as the comprehensive 2009 Arctic Marine Shipping Assessment notes (p. 34), this would spell “the disappearance of multi-year sea ice in the central Arctic Ocean. Such an occurrence would have significant implications for design, construction and operational standards of all future Arctic marine activities.” In the absence of thick multi-year ice, which can be up to five meters deep, any water that refreezes would take the form of much thinner, more navigable seasonable ice.
In other words, forget needing nuclear icebreakers. Within the next few decades, in summer, it may be possible (even if insurance companies and the Polar Code still mandate polar-class, ice-resistant ships) to sail in a regular vessel across the top of the Earth.
Icebreakers: a short-lived technology?
The crew of Arktika at the North Pole on 17 August 1977, sixty years after the Bolshevik Revolution. The Soviet icebreaker was the first surface vessel to ever reach the North Pole. Source: Go Arctic
It was not until 1977 that the first surface vessel reached the North Pole. That ship was Arktika, a Soviet nuclear icebreaker which chugged to 90 degrees north from the industrial city of Murmansk. At that time, the Central Arctic Ocean was still in a deep freeze. Scientific papers such as the 1973 Journal of Glaciologyarticle from which the figure below is taken describe how near the North Pole, “only 0.2% of the area was ice-free.” Such writing now reads like pre- rather than post-apocalyptic science fiction, chronicling once-upon-a-time worlds rather than worlds that might one day be.
An excerpt from “The mass balance of the sea ice of the Arctic Ocean,” an article published in Journal of Glaciology in 1973.
It is both remarkable and terrifying to think that just ten or twenty years from now – and just some six or seven decades after Arktika’s historic voyage – ice-strengthened and perhaps even conventional ships may be able to reach the top of the planet. It is also astonishing that as recently as 2007, people were still talking about the “viability of transarctic nuclear shipping,” as the department head of the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy suggested at a conference in Akureyri that year [2]. He was contemplating using nuclear ships to mitigate emissions depositing soot onto the ice cap that, by darkening it, would accelerate warming. But for better or worse, once the Arctic’s sea ice is gone, the additional climactic consequences of turning what was once white black will be a moot point.
Arktika’s trip to the North Pole was deliberately timed to coincide with the sixtieth anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution. Ominously, it may also coincide with sixty years before the time when ships could sail directly across an ice-free North Pole. By one estimate, when the Arctic becomes ice-free – and this is almost surely to happen within the next few decades, if only in summer – this will mark the first time in 2.6 million years that the Arctic Ocean has lacked any sea cover.
At the stage when all the ice disappears, icebreaking will become a technology that, invented in its modern variant in 1897, was only really necessary for 150 to 200 years. Like the zeppelin and the Concorde before it, icebreakers will become a futuristic technology lost to history. Their early demise won’t be due to technological or financial failures, however, but rather because humankind made the surfaces it traversed obsolete
The case for shipping via the North Pole
In a world where timeliness means the difference between loss and profit, the Transpolar Passage could prove enticing, just as the Northern Sea Route and Northwest Passage do. For journeys between Europe and Asia, the Northern Sea Route can already be two to three weeks faster than the Suez Canal. By cutting straight across the Arctic, the Transpolar Passage could save a further two days [1]. It might even make sailing through Arctic straits (the Northern Sea Route and Northwest Passage) “obsolete,” as one book suggests.
Fast shipping isn’t everything, of course. Besides time, shipowners also consider risks and costs, and polar shipping still is a more dangerous and pricier undertaking due to the advanced types of ships required, insurance costs, and icebreaker escort fees. Most shipping these days also follows the pendulum model, with vessels stopping at ports between their origin and destination to make deliveries. This logistics chain requires markets, of which there are obviously none in the middle of the Arctic Ocean.
Developing the Transpolar Passage might therefore necessitate some creative rejiggering of the global shipping system. Mikaa Mered, professor of Arctic and Antarctic politics at the ILERI School of International Relations in France, and Adeline Descamps, editor-in-chief of the Journal de la Marine Marchande, have referred to this as a “reversed hub and spoke system.” Ports situated at the Arctic Ocean’s Atlantic and Pacific gateways, like Dutch Harbor, Alaska, which already sees thousands of ships a year pass between North America and Asia, could become hubs for the Transpolar Passage. Cargo could be fast-tracked between Europe and Asia and North America via polar-class shuttles sailing across the Arctic Ocean. These ships also wouldn’t have size restrictions, as the Central Arctic Ocean’s bathymetry isn’t as limiting as the Northern Sea Route or Northwest Passage. Once out of the Arctic Ocean, cargo could be transshipped from places like Dutch Harbor to ports along the North Pacific, or, on the other side, from a place like Iceland to ports along the North Atlantic.
Mered admitted over email, “I know that all of this may sound far-fetched.” But since he first heard the concept discussed at a closed-door Arctic business meeting in northern Norway, he has seen Chinese, South Korean, Icelandic, Alaskan, Russian and Norwegian stakeholders talking about it in greater and greater detail. Alluding to talk of investments in shipbuilding research and design, research taking place already within the Arctic, and infrastructure development, Mered concluded, “I don’t see now why this model wouldn’t emerge by 2050.”
These gateway areas, however – especially around the Bering Sea, where subsistence hunting and fishing is still a vibrant and critical practice – are also where the negative impacts of increased shipping may be felt. Along the Bering Strait, where the Northern Sea Route, Northwest Passage, and Transpolar Passage all meet, people living in communities such as Nome, Teller, or Dutch Harbor, Alaska could all potentially see more ships passing by, and maybe docking, by mid-century. For them, though, this activity may not herald the start of a great new gilded age of connectivity and globalization. The appearance of open water will drastically undermine food security and permanently alter a way of life that has relied on ice and the beluga whales, walruses, and seals that flock to it for generations. To counteract these losses, in a 2014 workshop called “Bering Strait Voices on Arctic Shipping,” one participant suggested that the ships that are already docking could pay into a fund that contributes to protecting food security. Yet while money might bring more food into Bering Strait communities, it can’t bring back the ice.
While more ships may soon sail through the Bering Strait, the age-old practice of hunting walrus on the ice may come to an end this century.
China prepares for an ice-free Arctic Ocean
While most of the world buries its collective head in the sand when it comes to climate change, there is one country that is preparing – paradoxically, somehow both ominously and optimistically – for a future that is several degrees hotter: China. The world’s largest nation sees a planet that is inevitably getting much, much warmer. Even if the planet were to stop emitting all greenhouse gases today, those that already have been emitted into the atmosphere will still induce warming effects for years to come. Since we don’t appear to be doing much to limit our emissions, we are headed for a warmer world – one where the Arctic ice cap may be gone in summer by 2050, and possibly even sooner.
The only country that seems to be ready for that reality is China. In its Arctic Policy, released in January 2018, China calls the trans-Arctic passage the “Central Passage.” It is not referenced in any dramatic way. In that matter-of-fact, this-is-how-the-world-is tone characteristic of Chinese policy documents, the policy notes, “The Arctic shipping routes comprise the Northeast Passage, Northwest Passage, and the Central Passage.” The strategy also mentions the Polar Silk Road, which is often viewed as synonymous with the Northern Sea Route. But keep in mind that the strategy notes that by cooperating with other stakeholders, China aims to “build a ‘Polar Silk Road’ through developing the Arctic shipping routes” – plural likely intentional.
Mered, the ILERI professor, described:
“When we talk about the ‘Polar Silk Road,’ we’re talking about a two-step idea. At first, shipping through the Northeast Passage, with all the limits we know. And then, when market and ice conditions show the model is viable, shipping through the Central Arctic Passage with the shuttle system.”
Meanwhile, other countries’ policies fail to mention any variants of the “Central Passage.” Norway’s Arctic Strategy, updated in 2017, doesn’t include the trans-Arctic passage in the full-length Norwegian version or in the shorter English summary. The former merely indicates (in Norwegian), “As ice conditions change, both the Northeast Passage and the Northwest Passage will be relevant for transport between markets in the Atlantic and the Pacific.”
Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy only references the Northwest Passage. South Korea – an Asian trading nation with Arctic shipping interests – also describes only the Northern Sea Route in its Arctic Policy.
Iceland’s Arctic Policy, dating back to 2011, also fails to mention the Transpolar Passage. The country, however, which might have served as a sort of shipping hub for Viking voyages around the North Atlantic a thousand years ago [3], may be one place where the route has some resonance. In April, a contract was signed Icelandic stakeholders and German port operator Bremenports to begin construction on a deepwater transshipment port Finnafjörður, a harbor in northeast Iceland, that would service vessels “crossing the North Pole capturing the Asia-Europe route,” as this promotional material (PDF) states. The German company is not Iceland’s only investor, for farsighted China also appreciates the North Atlantic island’s geostrategic potential, as Malte Humpert and Andreas Raspotnik noted in their 2012 article on the Transpolar Sea Route. China and Iceland signed a free trade agreement in 2013, and last year, the China-Iceland Arctic Science Observatory opened outside Akureyri.
Finally, in the so-called “reluctant Arctic state” where less than a fifth of people surveyed know that the country has people and territory in the Arctic, the U.S., a new Arctic defense strategy is still in the works. In the meantime, a March 2019 Congressional Research Service report entitled “Changes in the Arctic: Background and Issues for Congress,” may give some insight into how the region’s shipping potential is perceived in Washington, D.C. The document acknowledges only two routes in its section on commercial sea transportation: the Northern Sea Route and the Northwest Passage. It opens with the typical statement about how Western explorers have sought a shortcut from the Atlantic to Asia for five centuries. Little do they seem to realize, however, that Eastern explorers are now seeking that same shortcut, but right across the North Pole rather than around any continent.
Underscoring the outdated thinking, the report recognizes that since some experts predict that the Arctic will be ice-free in late summer by the 2030s, “this opens opportunities for transport through the Northwest Passage and the Northern Sea Route.” Rather inexplicably, the map included is from 2008 – a year when there were 2.34 million more square kilometers of sea ice in October than there were in 2018 [4]. Not only is the figure over a decade old: it represents a time when there were only two conceivable Arctic Ocean routes rather than three.
The nearly 11-year old figure of Arctic shipping inexplicably included in the March 2019 Congressional Research Service report entitled “Changes in the Arctic: Background and Issues for Congress.”
How exactly would that figure look if it were updated? With Community Earth System Models (CESM) data kindly processed and provided by Scott Stephenson, a geographer at the University of Connecticut and Arctic shipping expert, I was able to mock up a few visualizations of how this would look. Scott has done fantastic work showing that new trans-Arctic shipping routes would be navigable by the middle of this century.
Sea ice concentration in these figures is based on the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5, as that is the situation for which we are most likely headed based on current emission levels. This would result in a world that is close to an average 4.9 degrees Celsius hotter by the century’s end – not the 2 degrees that the Paris Agreement is aiming for. For the purposes of the visualization, I noted that the Transpolar Passage was “open” when there was a clear route across the North Pole – yet sailing even outside these years may be possible, to, provided the ice is thin enough.
The inevitability of a Transpolar Passage
One might argue that China’s efforts to drum up the Transpolar Passage is a form of geopolitical posturing. Unlike the Northeast and Northwest Passages, the Transpolar Passage would run mostly through the high seas, where all countries have freedom of navigation, rather than through any waters that could be claimed as internal. China would not be beholden to any government’s regulations when sailing there.
More than just an act of geopolitical bravado, however, China may also be trying to establish first-mover advantage in the Transpolar Passage because the climate science makes clear that a seasonally ice-free Arctic is nearly inevitable.
If there is to be a whole new blue ocean within our lifetimes, the real mystery is why other countries aren’t also preparing for an Arctic waterworld. Doing so would mean that rather than only focusing on building icebreakers for the near-term (which China is also doing), serious thought is also given to issues like safety at sea when ships are sailing past the remote North Pole and how to maintain the food security of communities in places like the Bering Strait.
While some might be excited about the possibility of sailing across a new watery passage, merchant marines of the late 21st and 22nd centuries will not be able to write, as James Cook poetically did in 1778, of being “close to the edge of the ice, which was as compact as a wall, and seemed to be ten or twelve feet high at least.” They may describe blue waves and white caps, but ice will be a distant memory, save for perhaps a few holdouts on Greenland’s rugged north shore. Sailing in an ice-free summer also won’t even deliver the joys of watching the aurora due to the 24-hour daylight. Sailor logbooks that recount the color of the aurora over the open ocean at the North Pole will have to wait until voyages during ice-free winters are possible. But those, too, will one day arrive.
A vanishing sight: Perilous Position of HMS ‘Terror’, Captain Back, in the Arctic Regions in the Summer of 1837, by William Smyth R.N. HMS Terror and her sister ship, HMS Erebus, later infamously became entrapped in ice in the Northwest Passage with their entire crews perishing.

The Arctic is warming at a rate of almost twice the global average.
Without urgent action to cut greenhouse gas emissions, the world will continue to feel the effects of a warming Arctic: rising sea levels, changes in climate and precipitation patterns, increasing severe weather events, and loss of fish stocks, birds and marine mammals.
Why it matters
The average temperature of the Arctic has increased 2.3°C since the 1970s.
By 2100, polar bears could face starvation and reproductive failure even in far northern Canada.
Around 35,000 walruses came ashore on the Alaska coast in September 2014. It’s the largest ‘haul out’ ever recorded. US government agencies estimated that 60 young walruses were crushed in the crowd.
Warmer winter temperatures have also increased the layers of ice in snow, making food more difficult to dig up in winter.
Fish stocks in the Barents Sea are moving north at up to 160 kilometres per decade as a result of climate change.
The fish are sensitive to changes in water temperature. This poses a risk for commercial and subsistence fisheries that may see fish resources move away from where they can harvest them. The moving fish also change the ecosystems into which they move.
On the tundra, rising temperatures have brought a new competitor - the Arctic fox’s much larger cousin, the red fox. Not only does the newcomer colonise their dens, it can also kill the smaller Arctic foxes.
In the ocean, both scientists and Inuit say killer whales appear to be increasing in numbers, and in the length of time they stay in the Arctic. Killer whales prey on narwhals and bowhead whales.
With increased shipping comes spill risk (both fuel and cargo), “black carbon” emissions that help to speed the rate of Arctic melting, ship noise that may also affect whales, and icebreaking that can disrupt ice crossing routes for people and animals.
In 2013, a large bulk carrier transited the Northwest Passage for the first time. In 2018, the first cargo ship transited the Arctic north of Russia.
Reduced ice cover is making offshore oil production in the Arctic more commercially viable. In 2014, the first commercial development of offshore oil (Prirazlomnoye) was pumped from Russian Arctic waters.
Our solutions
How we work
Communicating a warming Arctic
WWF brings the effects of climate change in the Arctic to a global audience, and makes the connections between Arctic warming and global impacts.
Helping highly endangered seals
As Finland's climate warms, the country is seeing less snow cover. WWF is helping the extremely endangered Saimaa ringed sealsfind suitable places to nest by creating man-made snow banks.
Planning a future for the Last Ice Area
WWF is looking at the future management of the ""Last Ice Area"", the place where summer sea ice is projected to persist longest.
Promoting renewable energy
WWF is advocating for renewable energy, and piloting renewable solutions with some Arctic communities.
Protecting the Last Ice Area in Greenland
The Last Ice Area will be essential as an enduring home for ice-dependent life. WWF-Denmark has made a proposal to include the Greenland section of the Last Ice Area on the tentative list for UNESCO world heritage.
Recommending action for walruses
The first circumpolar report on walrus conservation recommends research into the effects of industrial activities on the Arctic animals.
Surveying polar bears in Western Hudson Bay
WWF supports polar bear surveys using an innovative mark-recapture technique that does not require tranquilising the bears.

The Arctic environment
Antarctica (Section 16.3) is a continent in a hemisphere that is mostly water. The Arctic (Fig 1) is mostly ocean, surrounded by mostly land. Therefore the two polar areas are very different. Greenland is covered by an icecap up to 2,700 m thick. Its northern tip is less than 800 km from the North Pole. West of Greenland is the Canadian Arctic Archipelago (1, 3), extending from Resolution Island at 61� N to Ellesmere Island at 83� N, about 2,400 km away. It is almost entirely within the Arctic Circle (at 67� N). The Arctic Islands are numerous, the region is about two million km2, 65% of which is land. There are rugged mountains exceeding 2000 m towards Greenland, mainly Baffin Island, but the average elevation of the islands in the west is below 300 m. The vegetation in summer is tundra, wherever there is neither bare ground, snowfields or glaciers. There are a few other large islands in the eastern (Eurasian) hemisphere, in particular Svalbard and Novaya Zemlya.

The RMS Titanic, a great ocean liner believed to be unsinkable, made its maiden voyage from England to New York in 1912. On 14 April, just before midnight, she collided at 22 knots with an iceberg estimated to be 70-150 m long and 20-40 m high above the water surface. The Titanic sank with the loss of 1513 lives in the icy waters. The collision happened at a latitude of merely 42� N. It is notable that huge icebergs last to such a low latitude (the same as that of Rome), after drifting from Baffin Bay within the Arctic Circle (Fig 2). Such drifts are relatively rare. It is estimated that of the 15,000 to 30,000 icebergs produced annually by the glaciers of Greenland only one percent (150 to 300) ever make it to the Atlantic Ocean.
Icebergs of course extend much deeper in the water than they are high. The ratio of the submerged mass to the total mass equals the ratio of the density of ice to that of water, i.e. about 7/8. While almost all icebergs in the Southern Ocean are tabular (flat top), most are not in the Arctic, as in Fig 2.
The Arctic Ocean, and sea ice
Most of the Arctic Ocean is over 1000 m deep and is continuously covered with ice whose thickness varies between 1-10 m. About one third of the Arctic Ocean is shallow, i.e. continental shelf. Over these shelf areas, ice is absent at least part of the year, but ice is found year-round over the deep ocean. Therefore the seasonal variation of the area of sea ice is smaller in the Arctic than around Antarctica. In the Arctic, the sea-ice area ranges between 9 and 12 x 106 km2 (as opposed to 4 and 19 x 106 km2 around Antarctica). As a comparison, the contiguous USA is about 9 x 106 km2 in size. Much of the Arctic seasonal variation in ice cover can be found in the Bering Sea (mainly adjacent to the continents, and south to the Aleutian Islands), and in the Sea of Okhotsk, as far south as 42�N, near Hokkaido, Japan. Yet even in winter the area between Norway and Svalbard is ice-free, notwithstanding its high latitude (about 77�N), on account of the Gulf Stream.
There is some evidence that the Arctic sea-ice cover has decreased about 6% during the last two decades, and that the mean ice thickness has decreased as well. The sea-ice cover must have been thicker during the last Ice Age (esp. between 26 - 13 kaBP), because there is no sediment of atmospheric dirt of that age on the seabed (4). The amount of sea ice is rather sensitive to climate change: meltwater ponding, for instance, dramatically increases the albedo of sea ice, leading to enhanced ice melt.
Unlike tropical oceans, which are temperature-stratified (i.e. there is a thermocline), the Arctic Ocean is salinity-stratified, although at high latitudes the ocean is much less stable. The temperature profile is nearly uniform at 0 to 1� C in the Arctic Ocean, but the salinity increases slightly with depth, especially at 10-100 m below the surface. The presence of this halocline is important in the formation of ice. Because of its salt, ocean water freezes only at -1.8�C. And salt water is most dense at its freezing point, unlike fresh water, which is most dense at 4�C. So if there were no halocline in the Arctic Ocean, the entire ocean column would have to cool to -1.8� C before its surface could freeze (Note 11.5).
The Arctic Basin receives a large amount of fresh water from the large rivers on the surrounding continents (mainly the MacKenzie in Canada and the Ob, the Yenisey and the Lena in Siberia), and during the short summer these freshwater sources spread out over large areas. Because of its low salinity, this water remains close to surface and is first to freeze up in autumn. First year ice can be readily distinguished from older ice in that it is smoother and less thick. Even in winter there are usually long leads of open water, mainly downwind of continental areas. These leads, or polynias, are an important source of heat and moisture to the Arctic. Therefore even in winter stratus clouds are common.
The Arctic Basin is virtually closed near Alaska, because the Bering Strait is narrow and shallow (~50m deep). There is some inflow of low-salinity water from the Bering Sea into the Arctic. More significant circulation occurs on the Atlantic side, with inflow north of Norway and outflow near Greenland. As a result of these currents, the sea ice drifts, generally cyclonically around the Pole. Because of the southward transport off East Greenland, ice is found there year-round, as far south as Greenland's southern tip (60�N). In the winter and early spring icebergs are found as far south as 45�N near Newfoundland, due to the Labrador current. This puts some icebergs in the main transatlantic shipping lane, a fact which proved fatal to the Titanic.
The Labrador Current is anomalously fresh, especially in summer, because of the melting of ice. It proceeds from the southern tip of Greenland southwards along the coast of Newfoundland, where it deflects east the poleward warm and salty North Atlantic current, at about 52�N. The mixture of cold water from the Labrador current with saltier water may make the top layer unstable. Therefore deep-water formation often occurs near the edge of the Labrador current (5).
Arctic climate
Because of the high latitude, there is a strong seasonal cycle and a weak diurnal cycle. Annual mean incoming solar radiation north of the Arctic circle is 100 W/m2, most of it between the spring and autumn equinoxes. Midlatitude places receive about 150-200 W/m2 on average.
As a result, daily mean temperatures are below freezing for several months: 3 months in Toronto (44� N), 8 months at Iqaluit (64� N), and 10 months at Alert (83� N) at the north end of Ellesmere Island. The lowest January mean near-sea-level temperature measured in the northern hemisphere (ie - 35� C) was measured at Alert. Record low temperatures have occurred in inland valleys, e.g. - 55.8� C at Lake Hazen. The daily temprature range is small because of the level Sun, i.e. less than 3 K, except in April and May when they may approach 6 K.
Precipitation from the cold air is modest, mostly under 250 mm/a. For instance Resolute (75� N) receives about 137 mm/a on average, mostly snow. All precipitation data in cold climates are only approximate, because snow is driven by wind and it is hard to discriminate between falling and blowing snow. The more mountainous regions, such as Baffin Island, Greenland (esp the southern coast) and northern Scandinavia receive more precipitation, for instance 663 mm/a falls at 390 m at Cape Dyer (Baffin Island, 64� N).
Precipitation amounts increase with elevation. For instance, on Resolution Island just south of Baffin Island, 313 mm/a falls at 40 m elevation and 404 mm/a at 370 m. This is a 9 % increase per 100 m. Four stations on the White Glacier on Axel Heiberg Island at 79�N yield an increase of about 7%/100 m. These figures are comparable to the about 11 %/100 m for other latitudes (6).
Cloudiness is rather high over the Arctic, and shallow stratus clouds prevail. There is a small but significant contribution to the cloudiness in Arctic regions due to an organic dimethyl sulphide compound called DMSP, formed in the ocean. The cells of phytoplankton (i.e. microscopic algae) burst when they die, releasing DMSP into the water. This degrades into molecules of insoluble sulphide, which are released into the air on the evaporation of spray, for instance. These aerosol molecules help nucleate cloud droplets (4).
It is not as windy in the Arctic as near the Antarctic coast, in part because the pressure gradients are weaker, and because katabatic winds do not exist over most of the Arctic. Yet the katabatic winds which blow off West Greenland are sufficient to drive ice floes away from the shore, and to induce a northwards ocean current along the coast.

ABSTRACT
The Diavik mine, located in the Archean-age Slave geologic province in northern Canada, is one of the world’s preeminent sources of gem diamonds. Since mining operations began in 2003, it has produced over 100 million carats of diamonds. This article will review the discovery, development, and operation of the mine, which is situated in a remote subarctic setting in the Northwest Territories. Four kimberlite pipes occur in close proximity—three are being exploited, while the fourth will be brought into production in 2018. Diavik is now expected to operate through 2024; upon closure, the equipment, buildings, and infrastructure will be removed and the land returned as closely as possible to its original condition.
INTRODUCTION
Canada is the world’s fourth-largest diamond producer, with most of that output coming from one area near Lac de Gras in the Northwest Territories. The discovery of kimberlite pipes there in the early 1990s led to the development of several major mines. Diamond-bearing kimberlite deposits that can be mined economically are noteworthy, since only about 50 such occurrences have been found worldwide since the 1870s, mainly in Australia, Angola, Canada, Russia, and South Africa (Janse, 2007). As of mid-2016, Canada has three active mines: Ekati and Diavik (figure 1), located about 30 km from each other in the Northwest Territories (figure 2), and the Victor mine in northern Ontario. Snap Lake, recently placed in a care and maintenance status, lies within 80 km of Ekati and Diavik. Two other Canadian mines are under development: Gahcho Kué in the Northwest Territories and Renard in Quebec. Figures from the Kimberley Process (www.kimberleyprocess.com/en/canada) show that Canada produced 11.6 million carats of rough diamonds in 2015, valued at US$1.675 billion.
This article will discuss the discovery, development, and operation of Diavik, one of the richest diamond mines in the world. Over several days in late June 2015, the authors visited the site to capture photographs and gather information on the mining operations. The visit involved tours of the open pit and underground workings, the processing and recovery plant, and the facility in Yellowknife where diamonds are cleaned and sorted for distribution (figure 3). In this article, we focus on the unique engineering challenges in developing the Diavik mine and recovering diamonds from beneath a lake in a harsh sub-arctic environment, all while doing so in a way that protects the environment, ensures worker safety, and respects the cultural traditions of the local indigenous peoples.
DIAMOND EXPLORATION IN CANADA
Canada is the world’s second-largest country in terms of land area, but until the 1990s it was not considered an important source of gemstones. During the preceding century, alluvial diamonds were occasionally found in scattered locations across southern Canada and the northeastern United States (Hausel, 1995). Their association with glacial sediments in the Great Lakes region led Hobbs (1899) to propose that the diamonds had been transported by the southward movements of glaciers (which covered large portions of Canada during the Pleistocene epoch, from 2.5 million until about 12,000 years ago) from unknown source rocks in the area near Hudson Bay (see also Bell, 1906).
Kjarsgaard and Levinson (2002) presented a comprehensive review of the discovery and development of Canada’s diamond mines through the 1990s. Although the north-central areas of the country were known to be underlain by ancient rocks of Archean age—the rocks that also host diamondiferous kimberlites in southern Africa and elsewhere—there was little effort on the part of large mining companies to search for diamonds in the Slave craton (Pell, 1995; Carlson et al., 1999). Along with the vast expanse of territory, the very small target area presented by kimberlite pipes, and the cost of search efforts over a period of years, those authors suggested two additional reasons for the lack of diamond exploration programs in northern Canada. The first was logistical: the remoteness of the area, much of it covered by water, and the harsh climate that limited the field season for exploration. The second reason was the glacial dispersal of the contents of exposed kimberlite pipes by the movement of ice sheets away from the original pipe locations. New geological exploration techniques, similar to those being used in Siberia, were needed to search for diamondiferous kimberlites in this type of terrain, which is much different from that of southern Africa (McClenaghan and Kjarsgaard, 2001).
According to Kjarsgaard and Levinson (2002), the modern era of diamond exploration in Canada began in the early 1960s with the traditional search for the diamond “indicator minerals” (such as red Cr-rich pyrope garnet, green Cr-diopside, green olivine, black ilmenite and black Cr-spinel). These minerals, which weather out of kimberlites but are retained as colorful grains in alluvial sediments in far greater abundance than the similarly resistant but much rarer diamonds (Gurney, 1984; McClenaghan, 2005; Shirey and Shigley, 2013). The discovery of these minerals signaled the presence of kimberlites in a particular area, and chemical analysis of them could distinguish those pipes that might contain diamonds. In Canada, the search for these minerals would ultimately involve years of lonely work in a nearly uninhabited and inhospitable region (Krajick, 2001).
The topography of northern Canada has been significantly influenced by periods of glaciation in the geologic past. The land is relatively flat to slightly undulating, marked by low barren hills and shallow bodies of water. In this setting, diamond prospectors had come to believe that sampling glacial eskers (narrow, sinuous ridges composed of sand and gravel sediments deposited by streams from melting glaciers) for indicator minerals might prove successful in locating kimberlites. This had been the case with searching for similar minerals in stream sediments in nonglaciated terrains (McClenaghan et al., 2000; McClenaghan and Kjarsgaard, 2001). Initial target areas included northern Ontario and portions of Quebec, followed by a shift in exploration toward the north and west of the country.
Diamond prospectors who previously found indicator minerals along the Mackenzie River Valley in the Northwest Territories realized that the westward movement of glaciers had transported these minerals from source rocks near the center of the continent. In the early 1980s, improved airborne geophysical survey methods for locating small-target kimberlite pipes over a wide area, combined with a better understanding of how to check sediments from both glacial moraines and eskers, led to preliminary diamond discoveries in various parts of the country. After these initial finds, however, the idea of a more extensive search for diamonds in northern Canada was met with skepticism. Initial exploration efforts involved several major mining companies, but the search was primarily undertaken by smaller companies and even groups of individual prospectors.
In April 1990, after a decade of exploration across an east-west distance of 1,200 km in the Northwest Territories, came Chuck Fipke’s discovery of a bright green Cr-diopside crystal on a ridge at Point Lake, a small, circular crater-like lake just north of Lac de Gras. As this mineral does not survive travel far from its source rock, he concluded that it had come from a kimberlite pipe in the immediate vicinity. This led Fipke and his partner in Dia Met Minerals, fellow geologist Dr. Stewart Blusson, to stake a claim. Years later this area would become part of the Ekati mine (Fipke et al., 1995). Additional heavy mineral samples collected north of Point Lake confirmed the presence of a kimberlite pipe. Partnering with BHP Minerals, a large international mining company based in Australia, they obtained drill core samples from the pipe to better evaluate its mineral content and structure.
In November 1991, BHP announced that 59 kg of kimberlite core samples from the site contained 81 small gem-quality diamonds, and that the company would spend up to $500 million to develop a mine. Over the next 12 months, this stunning development triggered the biggest land rush in Canadian history, as mining companies and individual prospectors staked claims over some 22,000 square kilometers in the north-central part of the country (Krajick, 1994, 2001; Boyd, 2006).
Over the past 25 years, exploration efforts have identified more than 500 kimberlite pipes throughout Canada, with more than 50% containing traces of diamonds. Most of these occurrences are located in the Lac de Gras region near the center of the Slave craton (Carlson et al., 1999). Few of these pipes are directly exposed at the surface; most are buried beneath bodies of water, and they have been revealed by geophysical and field sampling techniques. Because kimberlites weather and decompose faster than much older surrounding rocks, the pipes often occur in topographic depressions beneath lakes. By the end of 1994, a total of 39 kimberlites had been identified in the Lac de Gras area, including what would become the country’s first diamond mine: Ekati, which opened in the fall of 1998. Because these kimberlite pipes were located in an ecologically sensitive portion of northern Canada, the mining ventures had to undergo an extensive environmental, economic, and social review involving several government agencies and local indigenous communities before proceeding with development.
DISCOVERY AND HISTORY OF DIAVIK
By early 1992, Aber Diamond Corporation had staked a claim to 3,250 square kilometers in the Diavik area. The company began a helicopter-borne magnetic survey (in partnership with Kennecott Canada, the exploration arm of Rio Tinto) to identify target locations as prospective kimberlite pipes (Carlson et al., 1999; Graham et al., 1999). A Yellowknife-based exploration company (Covello, Bryan & Associates) was hired for the prospecting activities. Ground, gravity, and other geophysical measurements were also made to confirm that the targets were kimberlites, and to better delineate the size of potential pipes. Samples collected from glacial till, streams, and beaches around these locations were analyzed for indicator minerals. When potential targets were detected, they were ranked in order of priority for additional study based on their geophysical characteristics and proximity to the indicator minerals. Core drilling of the most promising sites was then carried out to determine the lateral extent of the pipe and its micro-diamond content.
Indicator minerals were first discovered on the Diavik property in 1994, near what was then designated as the A21 anomaly, but the decision was made to first core-drill the nearby anomaly that later became the A154 (South) pipe. This drilling produced a section of kimberlite core that broke open to reveal a 2.5 ct diamond crystal (Graham et al., 1999; Tupper and Neamtz, 2002). Considering the rarity of diamonds in kimberlite pipes, to encounter such a large crystal in a random core section was remarkable. In 1995, the adjacent A418 pipe was evaluated for its diamond potential. Drilling revealed that the geomagnetic anomalies were small, steeply inclined, semicircular volcanic pipes that became narrower with depth.
By 1995, four diamond-bearing kimberlite pipes had been located—all beneath the waters of Lac de Gras. The pipes are adjacent to the lake shoreline and lie within 4 km of one another. Additional core drilling was carried out to carefully delineate the sizes and shapes of the pipes, and their potential diamond grade was estimated from analyzing the drill cores. Between 1996 and 1997, the initial pipes—A154 (which was later found to be two adjacent pipes) and A418—were accessed by several large-diameter (approximately 15 cm) holes, core drilling to depths of about 250 meters, and then by underground tunnels excavated 150 meters beneath Lac de Gras. From these activities, 5,937 tonnes of kimberlite ore were recovered from the A154 South and A418 pipes. Evaluation of this bulk sample was critical to determining whether the pipes contained enough high-quality diamonds for mining to be economical. Some of the recovered ore was analyzed at the company’s pilot processing plant in Yellowknife, and the rest was split into two portions for separate evaluation at both the Yellowknife plant and the nearby Ekati mine. In 1998, analysis of 21,013 carats of diamonds (one-third of which were gem quality) recovered from the bulk ore sample provided the first evidence of the mine’s economic potential.
Earlier in 1995, hydrological and geotechnical studies were begun to assist in the conceptual design and development of both the open-pit and planned underground mining operations. These studies have continued to the present day.
Despite the environmental and engineering challenges for large-scale mining in this remote region, Rio Tinto and Dominion Diamond Corp. (formerly Aber) established a formal joint venture in 1999 to develop the property. Rio Tinto managed and operated the mine through a wholly owned subsidiary, Yellowknife-based Diavik Diamond Mines Inc. Diamond production would be divided between the two organizations, with each independently marketing its own share.
In addition to examining the economic feasibility of operating a diamond mine under arctic conditions, the developers conducted environmental risk analysis between 1997 and 2000. A scientific assessment of all aspects of the regional environment provided a baseline to measure the impact of the subsequent construction and operation of the mine. Agreements also needed to be signed with the five First Nations—the Lutsel K’e Dene First Nation, the Yellowknives Dene First Nation, the Tlicho Government, the Kitikmeot Inuit Association, and the North Slave Metis Alliance—which had inhabited the area for centuries. These groups sought the protection of land and lakes and a share of the economic benefits from mining. In 2000, formal permission was granted to the joint venture to begin mine construction. This included an environmental agreement with the Canadian government, and a socioeconomic monitoring agreement with the government of the Northwest Territories.
Between 2000 and 2003, approximately CAD$1.3 billion was spent building the mine infrastructure, one of the largest capital investments undertaken in the history of Canadian mining. This included a plant to process the kimberlite ore and recover the diamonds, office and accommodation buildings for several hundred staff, utilities (electric power and heat generation, water supply, and wastewater treatment), bulk fuel and explosive storage, a maintenance shop, a containment area for storing the processed kimberlite, and an airstrip capable of handling cargo and passenger aircraft. Development of the site occurred in a relatively uninhabited arctic tundra setting—the closest indigenous community was 190 km to the southwest. Everything needed to construct and maintain the site had to be flown in from Yellowknife or trucked over an ice road during wintertime. Transition from a construction project to active diamond production commenced in January 2003, with an expected mine lifetime of about 16–22 years. Sales of the first rough diamonds began in the summer of that year.
In 2006 and 2007, another group of bulk kimberlite samples was collected underground at each of the three pipes (A154, A418, and A21) to determine underground mining conditions, to compare the impact of drill and blast mining versus machine mining on diamond value, and to provide about 15,000 carats from each pipe for additional estimations of rough diamond values. With the exception of the data on diamonds from A21, these 2006–2007 estimates have been superseded by more recent information obtained from actual production parcels from A154 (117,000 and 118,000 carats in May 2013) and A418 (186,000 carats in May 2012). Since 2003, the mine has yielded 100 million carats of rough diamonds, with the largest crystal found to date weighing 187.7 ct (figure 4). Named the “Diavik Foxfire,” it was produced between May 31 and June 6, 2015 (see the Lab Notes section of this issue, pp. 188–189). Previously, the largest gem-quality diamond recovered weighed 151 ct.
GEOLOGICAL SETTING
This kimberlite province, discovered in 1991 and measuring about 400 × 750 km, is a portion of the Slave craton, a region of the continental lithospheric plate (also known as the Canadian Precambrian Shield) that has remained geologically stable since Archean times 2.5 to 4 billion years ago (Pell, 1997; Bleeker, 2002; Davis et al., 2003; Canil, 2008; see boxes A and B and figure 5). In this region, the rocks that compose the ancient crust are exposed at the surface by glaciation. The craton consists of granites and gneisses, with younger volcanic and metasedimentary rocks deposited on them. It sits above a mantle “keel” (a downward-protruding thickened portion of the lithosphere) where relatively low heat-flow and reducing conditions have remained suitable for diamond formation and preservation for an extended period of geologic time (Shirey and Shigley, 2013). Explosive kimberlite magma eruptions rising through this keel zone brought diamonds to the crust. This is a typical setting for kimberlite pipes in Archean cratonic rocks worldwide.
Subsequent to kimberlite pipe emplacement, this portion of Canada was covered by a glacial ice sheet that culminated about 20,000 years ago. As stated above, this glaciation removed much of the topography of the area, including the upper portions of the kimberlite pipes. On East Island, where the Diavik mine is located, the kimberlite pipes are hosted in approximately 2.5-billion-year-old Archean granitic host rocks as well as some younger metasediments. Several Proterozoic diabase dikes cut through zones of structural weakness in these granitic rocks—these same zones may have been where exploding kimberlite magmas broke through to the surface.
Kimberlite pipes are the near-surface conduits of kimberlite volcanoes. As no such eruption has ever been observed, the geological understanding of these events is based almost entirely on observations of the pipes’ complex vertical structure obtained from drill core sections or exposed during underground mining, and from petrographic analysis of rocks found within the pipes (Moss et al., 2008). As in many other kimberlites worldwide, a complete understanding of the magma eruption process is often hindered by subsequent erosion, which removes important upper sections of a pipe.
More than 400 kimberlite pipes are now known in the Lac de Gras area (W. Boyd, pers. comm., 2016). They are distributed along a northwest-trending axis extending more than 120 km. Only a few are economic to mine for diamonds. The Diavik mine lies near the center of the Slave craton. The geology of the four kimberlite pipes on the mine property is now well understood based on field studies conducted over the past two decades (Graham et al., 1999; Bryan and Bonner, 2003). Kimberlites at the mine are interpreted as representing coherent pyroclastic and volcaniclastic types of igneous rocks, and the pipe emplacement has been dated at 55 ± 5 million years ago, during the Eocene epoch (Graham et al., 1999). The pipes are up to 20,000 square meters at the surface, and they extend down to depths of at least 600 meters. Each has a different mixture of kimberlite types and country rock. Field studies of the A154 pipe by Moss et al. (2008) revealed a poorly sorted massive volcaniclastic kimberlite overlain by a better-sorted stratified volcaniclastic kimberlite containing variable proportions of consolidated mud and, at the top of the sequence, a graded pyroclastic kimberlite. The pipes are capped by several meters of glacial till, a thin layer of lacustrine sediments, and 15–20 meters of lake water. Moss et al. (2008) proposed a six-stage explosive eruption model for the A154 pipe:
- Initial kimberlite eruption and excavation of the pipe to form a vertical pipe beneath a surface crater
- Collapse of the pyroclastic gas cloud from above, and partial infilling of the upper portion of the pipe with massive kimberlite from below
- Flows of debris from the surrounding crater walls and further infilling of the pipe, leading to the formation of the stratified kimberlite
- Alteration of rocks within the crater by hot circulating fluids originating from groundwater interacting with the underlying kimberlite magma
- Deposition of sediments in the upper portions of the crater, which now lie beneath a lake
- Deposition of pyroclastic kimberlite in the crater by material ejected from adjacent kimberlite eruptions
At Lac de Gras, glaciation removed the top portions of the pipes. When exposed at the surface, kimberlites weather and decompose, becoming softer than the surrounding country rocks. With the retreat of the glaciers, the pipe locations often became depressions in the land surface, which filled with water to become lakes. The lakes at pipe locations are generally deeper than those formed by just glacial action.
Careful documentation of the different types of kimberlite (and other rocks) within a pipe is important because these factors can exert some control over the size and abundance of the diamonds, and on the processing of the material as kimberlite ore. This typically involves analyzing hundreds of ore samples.
|Box A: The Slave Craton: An Ancient Remnant of Earth’s Early Crust|
|Seismically stable geological areas on Earth are known as cratons. These vestiges of ancient rock are the rarest, smallest, and oldest remnants of continental crust and immediately underlying 150–200 km of mantle (together known as the continental lithosphere). The Diavik mine lies in the middle of the Slave craton, which derives its name from the Great Slave Lake at its southern border. An exciting feature of the Diavik kimberlites, besides their abundance of diamonds, is that the kimberlite punctures and carries deeply derived pieces of the mantle from Earth’s ancient past. The geological history preserved in the Slave craton offers a fascinating record, one that can be read from the complicated surface geology and especially from the deep mantle-derived rock samples brought up within the kimberlite.|
Like other cratons (e.g., the Superior in Canada, the Kaapvaal in South Africa, or the Pilbara in Australia), the Slave craton is a complicated collage of different continental terranes created at different times and forced together over more than two billion years. The surface geology reveals the different ages of these units, and how they fit together like puzzle pieces. The vertical sampling of diamonds and mantle and crustal rocks by kimberlite that is then erupted to the surface becomes an invaluable tool to peer through the younger crustal rocks, which have a different surface geology from those at 30 to 150 km depths. With enough kimberlites and enough diamonds made available for study from mining operations, a vertical cross section of the craton can even be constructed (figure B-1).
At the surface of the Slave craton, the oldest rocks, some ranging in age up to 4.2 billion years, are exposed in the Acasta Gneiss Complex (AGC) on the far west side of the craton and in a north-south belt of gneisses known as the Central Slave Basement Complex (CSBC) in the center. Within these ancient complexes themselves, almost 1.4 billion years of geological evolution can be measured by radiometric dating methods. To the east of the CSBC, the surface rocks are all much younger, more granitic, and clearly related to the modern process of plate tectonic subduction that operated from the craton’s eastern side about 2.5 billion years ago (Bleeker, 2002). Surprisingly, the diamondiferous kimberlites in the Slave craton have erupted through the craton east of the CSBC—coming clearly through parts of the craton that are dominated by younger rocks (most typically 2.5 billion years). Because the diamonds in the Diavik and other kimberlites are much older (up to 3.5 billion years) and similarly old mantle xenoliths occur in the kimberlites, the deep mantle keel must reside some 100 km below younger crust. The surface geology of the Slave craton, therefore, is an asymmetrical geological construct whose depths are known because of diamondiferous kimberlite eruptions.
LOCATION AND ACCESS
The Diavik mine is located at 64°29ʹ46” N and 110°16’24” W, on a small island in Lac de Gras about 300 km northeast of Yellowknife (the capital of the Northwest Territories), and 220 km south of the Arctic Circle. The mine is situated in a continuous permafrost zone 100 km north of the tree line (the latitude above which trees cannot survive the cold temperatures). The permafrost layer extends from two meters below the surface down to a depth of about 250 meters. The bedrock consists of glacially eroded granite that is covered in many places by glacial till. The till is composed of sand, gravel, cobbles, and boulders in varying proportions in a rock flour matrix. Near the lake shorelines, the finer material has been washed out, leaving mainly boulders. Beneath the lakes, the till is overlain by several meters of fine sediment.
Summers at the site are short and cool, while the winters are long and extremely cold. In winter it is not unusual to have weeks with temperatures between –35°C and –40°C, with frequent strong winds making these temperatures feel even colder. Snow may fall in any month of the year, but it normally occurs between October and April. The region receives only about 300 mm of precipitation per year, mainly in the form of snow, so it can be considered an arctic semidesert. Daylight ranges from about four hours per day in winter to as much as 20 hours per day in summer. Throughout most of the year, the mine can only be reached by air. For a brief time in the winter, an ice road provides vehicle access for thousands of tons of equipment, supplies, and fuel (box C). There is no regular road network in this part of Canada.
MINE DESIGN
The fact that the four kimberlite pipes were located beneath Lac de Gras (figure 6) posed an engineering challenge if the pipes were to be exploited. The option of accessing and mining the pipes underground from an onshore portal tunnel was ultimately rejected because it would require leaving too much valuable kimberlite ore in place for structural support directly beneath the lake bed. Therefore, a traditional open-pit approach was chosen to remove the kimberlite from the upper portions of the pipes. However, this would require the construction of specially designed dikes surrounding the pipes to allow the open-pit mining of ore bodies that would otherwise be underwater. This required dredging of the lake, placing several million tons of crushed rock into the lake to create the dikes themselves, anchoring the dikes to the bedrock, transferring fish from the enclosed areas back into the lake, and removing several million cubic meters of water from the enclosed areas. Particular challenges included building the dikes without direct access to the bedrock beneath the lake, working during winter months of intense cold and extended darkness when the lake surface would be frozen, preventing debris from contaminating the lake, the use of local material for dike construction (blasted and crushed granite taken in stages from the open-pit locations), and a heavy reliance on an indigenous community workforce with no experience in heavy civil construction (Olive et al., 2004).
The retention dikes around the kimberlite pipes prevent water from flowing from Lac de Gras back into the open pits and the underground workings. Figure 7 shows that the dike is constructed with a flexible concrete water barrier that is anchored to the pressure-grouted bedrock. This wall is supported on both sides by a large volume of crushed granite waste rock. Several hundred sensors continually monitor temperature, pressure, and ground movement to ensure the structural integrity of the dikes. The ground that acted as the dike foundation was permanently frozen beneath the land surface but not beneath the lake, so special equipment was needed to maintain the permafrost in those locations. Where the dike crosses an island, special refrigeration systems known as “thermosyphons” were installed to remove heat and allow the permafrost below the lake to remain frozen.
The two initial crushed-rock dikes (surrounding the A154 and A418 pipes) total more than five kilometers in length. They stand as high as 32 meters above the lake bed and are wide enough to allow two large vehicles to pass one another. The dikes were constructed using 4.5 million tonnes of granite waste rock.
Because it is so remote, the mine must operate as a self-contained community. The site covers 10.5 square kilometers and contains a dormitory complex, a dining area, recreational and education facilities, an office and maintenance building, a warehouse, and an enclosed maintenance facility where even the largest hauling trucks used at the mine can be worked on year-round. Emergency response and medical services are also available. A 1,600-meter airstrip on the site can accommodate large transport aircraft throughout the year. All principal mine buildings are heated by a boiler plant and connected by elevated, well-lit enclosed corridors so that workers can pass from building to building without being exposed to the harsh winter climate.
Minimal amounts of water are taken from Lac de Gras. A system has been constructed around the island to collect water for reuse or for cleaning in a treatment plant before it is returned to the lake. A separate plant treats all domestic sewage.
A diesel power plant generates electricity for the entire site. A year’s supply of diesel fuel is stored on-site for the power plant as well as the mining vehicles. Excess heat from the power plant is used to warm some of the buildings and to heat water used in processing the kimberlite ore. In September 2012, a wind farm (figure 8) was added to provide a renewable source of electrical energy via a wind-diesel hybrid power plant. The wind farm, the first of its kind in the Canadian subarctic, lowered carbon emissions from the mining operations and reduced the need for diesel fuel to be hauled in.
A separate plant produces crushed granitic rock for dike construction, maintenance of the airport runway and road surfaces, and for use underground to backfill the open tunnels and other workings once the kimberlite ore is removed. Explosives used in mining operations are stored in a secure facility on-site.
MINING AND PRODUCTION
Operations. Open-pit operations on the two ore bodies of the A154 pipe began in January 2003, and mining of the A418 pipe followed in 2007 (figure 9). This type of mining was economically viable because the tops of the kimberlite pipes were within 20 meters of the surface, minimizing the amount of waste rock that had to be stripped away to expose them (figures 10 and 11). Kimberlite ore and granite rock overburden from the pits are hauled away by vehicles, without a system of ore buckets or conveyor belts. As surface mining is more economical than underground operations, the intent was to remove as much kimberlite ore as possible from the open pits over time. But as the pipe became narrower with depth, a point would be reached where ore could no longer be removed by vehicle haulage, and surface mining would then cease. In 2012, after three years and a cost of CAD$800 million, Diavik completed the transition to underground operations for the three pipes being exploited.
In the fall of 2014, Rio Tinto announced plans to develop the fourth kimberlite pipe on the property. Construction of the dike surrounding the A21 pipe will take four years; it will extend 2.2 km and require 3 million tonnes of crushed granite (figure 12). Production from the A21 pit is scheduled to begin in late 2018. Output from this pipe will not appreciably extend the life of the mine. Rather, it will offset the approaching decline in production from the underground operations and allow a continuation of existing kimberlite ore levels through the processing plant for several years.
Diavik’s original plan called for the eventual development of underground mining operations, primarily by ore trucks driving down a tunnel from the surface (figure 13). Prior to tunneling, an extensive geotechnical survey of the hydrogeology of the ore bodies and surrounding host rocks was carried out. The design of the open pits and the choice of surface mining methods took into account that the pits would be directly above the underground workings. To date, some 20 km of interconnected underground tunnels have been constructed. These heated and ventilated tunnels include rescue bays where miners can retreat for safety in emergencies, vehicle repair shops, ore passes, ventilation systems, water pumping stations, and storage areas (figures 14 and 15). The underground tunnels were designed to prevent rock in the overlying open pits from subsiding. Although surface mining of A154 and A418 has finished, the pits are the secondary access to the current underground workings via two entrance portals. Continuous monitoring of the now-unused open pits ensures the structural integrity of the pit walls, preventing breaching of the dikes from the surrounding lake and flooding of the underground workings.
Two types of underground mining were selected based on safety, cost, and other considerations. A technique known as blast-hole stoping (BHS) was chosen for A154N because of the stronger, more competent kimberlite rock in this pipe. It is a bottom-up bulk-mining method in which several days of ore production can be created with a single explosion. Holes are drilled vertically from a higher stope (mining cavity) and filled with explosives. When blasted, the broken ore falls to a lower stope, where it can be removed by a scoop loader and ore hauler. Once all the broken ore is removed, the open lower stope is completely backfilled with cemented waste rock, and the process is repeated at the higher stope.
A top-down bulk-mining method known as sub-level retreat (SLR) is used in the A418 and A154S pipes, where the kimberlite ore is weaker but contained within a more competent granite host rock. In this method, a series of horizontal tunnels on a single level is excavated into the pipe, and sections of ore above the tunnels are broken up using explosives. The broken ore falls into the tunnel and is removed. Once all the ore on the level is removed, a new set of tunnels is created farther down in the pipe, and the excavation process is repeated. The process creates a large open space within the pipe.
All three pipes are being excavated concurrently, and a mixture of both “hard” and “soft” kimberlite ore is sent through the processing and recovery plants. Although the mine was originally designed to handle 1.5 million tonnes of ore, this capacity was expanded to 2 million tonnes through operational improvements without the need for additional capital investment (Diavik diamond mine: 2014 sustainable development report, 2015). Kimberlite ore and waste rock are brought from the underground workings to the surface by haulage trucks using three portal entrances, and the material is dumped in a designated location on-site. Larger trucks haul the ore to the processing plant, and any waste rock goes to a separate dump location (figures 16 and 17). The decision to use trucks to haul ore and waste rock from underground, as opposed to a conveyor belt or ore bucket system, was based in part on the fact that the loaders and trucks from the open-pit mining operations were already available.
The kimberlite ore is processed in a large building on-site (figure 18) that is estimated to be 11 stories high and approximately 150 meters long and 40 meters wide. The ore first passes through a series of powerful magnets, which remove the unwanted pieces of steel mesh that are used to stabilize the tunnel walls. The ore is then crushed to progressively smaller pieces, removing the finer material. Diamonds are separated from the crushed ore by non-chemical, density-based methods to create a diamond-rich heavy-mineral concentrate (figure 19). Next, X-ray sorting uses fluorescence to recover diamonds from the concentrate. The processed ore material is then stored in a designated area on-site.
Although the diamond grade in the Diavik kimberlite pipes is very high compared to other primary mines, diamonds are still in very low concentrations overall, so a large amount of kimberlite ore must be extracted and processed to recover them. As at other major mines, it is always surprising to hear that most workers have “never seen a diamond in the mine.” Processing of the mixed kimberlite ore brought up from the workings of the A154 and A418 pipes involves a complex series of steps to create progressively smaller sizes to liberate the diamonds from the host rock (figures 20 and 21).
Grease tables are used to retrieve diamonds that cannot be efficiently recovered by X-ray fluorescence technology. Recovery of all diamonds takes place in a restricted area of the plant. Under stringent security, all diamonds are weighed, sorted, and documented before being packaged and flown to Yellowknife. At the product splitting facility, the rough diamonds are cleaned, sorted, and valued for government royalty purposes. The diamonds are separated by size for distribution to the two joint-venture partners, according to the production agreement. Once separated, the diamonds follow different paths for manufacturing and marketing.
Personnel. At the end of 2015, Diavik had approximately 1,000 employees, of whom 55% were from the Northwest Territories and 25% from the indigenous communities. Most employees work on a rotation, with two weeks of 12-hour shifts at the mine, followed by two weeks at home. Managerial staff work four days at the mine followed by three days off-site. Employee transportation to and from Yellowknife is provided by company or chartered aircraft. The mine operates around the clock every day of the year.
Safety. An extensive safety management system governs all aspects of mine operations. The system begins with training of all employees, safety standards for every area of activity, and regular reviews to continually monitor and improve safety practices. Before beginning any work activity, employees conduct a quick safety check to identify and discuss potential hazards associated with the activity, as well as preventive measures that can be taken. The entire mine site is inspected regularly by outside agencies to ensure that all operations are conducted in a manner that protects and enhances worker safety and the environment.
Mine safety is particularly critical when operating in a harsh environment (figure 22). In winter, mining activities can be disrupted by whiteout conditions, where the lack of visibility causes spatial disorientation and can be life-threatening. These conditions occur about four times per year and typically last 8 to 12 hours. Weather monitoring is conducted to warn mine staff of whiteout conditions, as well as the onset of very low temperatures.
Production. With the exception of 2009, when demand was low due to the global financial crisis, annual production of rough diamonds at Diavik has consistently surpassed six million carats. As shown in table 1, Diavik’s total mineral reserves at the end of 2015 were 18.7 million tonnes of unmined kimberlite ore containing an average of 2.8 carats of diamonds per tonne, for a total of 52.8 million carats of diamonds as proven or probable reserves. Table 2 presents annual production data from 2003 to 2014.

While the Diavik mine is not known for large diamonds, its kimberlite pipes contain exceptionally high grades (3–5 carats/tonne) of moderate- to high-value diamonds (compared to 0.5 to 1 carats/tonne in other locations). Production from the two operating pipes is valued well above the Kimberley Process average of US$116 per carat—$135 per carat for A154S and $175 per carat for A154N. The average value for A418 is $95 per carat (Dominion Diamonds, 2015).
Diamond crystals from the mine exhibit common forms such as octahedra, dodecahedra, macles, cubes, and aggregate shapes. Colorless crystals predominate, though brown and rarely yellow diamonds also occur; some others have a gray surface coating (Carlson et al., 1999).
CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
Relationship with Indigenous Communities. The 1991 diamond rush transformed the economy and society of the Northwest Territories. The subsequent development of several major diamond mines in this remote region transpired against the backdrop of a new relationship between the mine owners, the national government, and local communities. Over the past four decades, legislation, land claims, and legal challenges have strengthened the rights of Canada’s indigenous communities over the land and water resources within their traditional territory. An important component of this power-sharing and cross-cultural governance over important land-use, environment, and wildlife decisions has been the increasing reliance on management boards with representation from the federal government, the mining companies, and local communities.
The company maintains a socioeconomic monitoring agreement with the territorial government, as well as environmental protection agreements with the indigenous communities and the federal and territorial governments. Councils involving the indigenous peoples have been consulted on a regular basis about mining operations since the discovery of the diamond occurrence in 1993. Discussions with these local groups have prompted revisions to the mine operation and closure plans, and this is expected to continue as long as the mine is in operation.
A representative body called the Traditional Knowledge Panel advises the company based on centuries of local habitation. For example, traditional understanding of wildlife habitats is being incorporated into the reclamation plan for revegetating the area. There was some discussion in this panel of how far to go in the revegetation process. While some people from the community believed that nature would “heal itself,” most panel members understood that environmental disruptions from mine operations were more extensive than naturally occurring events, and that a more aggressive reclamation process was necessary (Diavik diamond mine reclamation review, 2007; Diavik diamond mine: 2014 sustainable development report, 2015).
As the mine was being developed, agreements were put into place to ensure that benefits would be made available to local indigenous communities. These included job training, employment at the mine, and opportunities for local businesses to provide needed services.
Environmental Monitoring and Protection. At Diavik, all mine activities are designed to protect the environment, anticipate potential problems, and meet regulatory requirements. A surveillance network is in place to monitor the water quality in and around the mine. In addition, the effects of mining operations on local wildlife (including caribou, wolverine, bear, and fish) and habitats (e.g., changes in vegetation) are checked on a regular basis. Efforts are made to minimize the production of dust from roadways and the airstrip.
Mine Closure and Reclamation. From the beginning of mine construction, plans were initiated to return the site to its nearly original condition once mining operations cease in 2024. Progressive reclamation of the site has been ongoing and is expected to cost US$131 million by 2030, once all the works have been removed from the site. A group of indigenous community representatives was organized to provide recommendations for the closure plan. They offered suggestions for revegetation and the creation of corridors for local wildlife such as caribou to pass through the mine site after closure. An important subject has been reclamation of the open pits to restore the original shoreline of Lac de Gras. The processed waste kimberlite ore will be sealed in a special containment area. All buildings and other facilities will be dismantled and removed, with the exception of the wind farm, which may be donated to provide electrical power to the community.
The final steps of the closure plan will be very complex. The waste piles must be shaped to match the natural landscape, which is relatively flat with occasional low hills and granite outcrops. The slopes of the piles must be stabilized to prevent them from giving way and endangering people or wildlife. Finally, the results of the reclamation project must have a neutral effect on the balance of nature in the environment. For example, the restored terrain should make it neither easier nor more difficult for migrating caribou to escape while being hunted by the indigenous peoples. Revegetation must not unduly attract caribou to the area or deter them from migrating through it (Diavik diamond mine reclamation review & cost estimate, 2007).
Even though Diavik was the second diamond mine to open near Lac de Gras, the joint venture faced considerable pressure from the local and federal governments, as well as environmentalists, to ensure the mine closure plan would return the land as closely as possible to its original state. This requirement came in response to the estimated 10,000 mining operations in the Canadian north that had closed with little or no reclamation plan, often posing physical or environmental hazards. For example, the Giant mine, a gold recovery operation near Yellowknife, closed in 1999, leaving 237,000 tonnes of toxic arsenic trioxide stored in the abandoned underground workings. Negotiations are still ongoing to decide on an appropriate clean-up plan and who should pay the cleanup costs (“Giant headache,” 2014).
MARKETING OF DIAVIK DIAMONDS
The rough diamond sorting process is highly automated. After recovery, the diamonds are conveyed into a secured section of the plant where they enter sorting units—large metal canisters containing progressively smaller sieves down to 3 mm. At each sieve level, the diamonds are transferred into separate containers and packaged for shipment.
The Diavik mine is jointly owned by Diavik Diamond Mines Inc. (a wholly owned subsidiary of Rio Tinto plc) and Dominion Diamond Diavik Limited Partnership (a wholly owned subsidiary of Dominion Diamond Corporation). From the mine, the sorted diamonds are flown to a product splitting facility near the Yellowknife airport, where they are divided between the two owners—60% to Rio Tinto and 40% to Dominion Diamonds.
Rio Tinto. This Anglo-Australian mining conglomerate owns a 60% stake in the Diavik mine, which produced 6.7 million carats in fiscal year 2015. It also owns a 100% stake in Australia’s Argyle diamond mine and sells that production in lots separate from Diavik. Rio Tinto markets all of its rough diamonds (figure 23) from a sales office in Antwerp, where it sold 70% of its four million carats from Diavik in 2015 at set prices to 17 “Select Diamantaires” who specialize in manufacturing and distributing Canadian rough and polished diamonds. These clients receive Diavik product via two-year supply contracts (Krawitz, 2015). Like De Beers, Rio Tinto schedules 10 sales, called “core sales,” each year.
Five times per year, Rio Tinto also auctions key assortments from its production to engage with customers outside of its Select Diamantaire base. The company sells fancy-color diamonds and rough diamonds larger than 10.8 ct through two “Specials” tenders each year.
Rio Tinto, under its “Diamonds with a Story” platform, promotes Diavik’s pure and clean Canadian origin and unique provenance. Downstream of the mine, Rio Tinto works in partnership with its Select Diamantaires to provide a tracking system, from the mine to the consumer, for Diavik diamonds (R. Ellison, pers. comm., 2016).
Dominion Diamond Corporation. Dominion Diamonds was originally the Canadian diamond exploration company Aber Resources, which discovered the Diavik site. Dominion owns 40% of the mine; the remainder is held by Rio Tinto, which developed the facility. Aber changed its name to Harry Winston Diamond Company in 2006 after acquiring the venerable jewelry retailer. In 2013, Harry Winston sold its retail division to Swatch, the Swiss-based luxury group, and became Dominion Diamond Company. The same year, the company acquired a majority share in the Ekati mine for $553 million. Dominion markets all of its Ekati and Diavik production separately.
In fiscal year 2015, Dominion sold 3.014 million carats of Diavik’s production for US$351.6 million, averaging about $117 per carat. By the end of 2015, according to Dominion’s annual report, the average per-carat price slipped to $105.
Dominion markets most of its Diavik and Ekati production through its sales offices in Antwerp. About 10% of its production is sold to clients in India ($30.4 million, against total sales of $351.6 million for fiscal year 2015). Initially, the mining companies in northern Canada set aside 10% of their production for local polishing operations (Krawitz, 2014). In 2008 there were six diamond polishing plants in Yellowknife, employing 150 workers (“Diamond cutting and polishing,” 2008). By the following year, however, they all had closed, unable to compete with operations in India and China; this resulted in the loss of CAD$22 million in territorial government investments (Danylchuk, 2011). Attempts to revive a large cutting industry in Yellowknife have not succeeded, and currently there is only one cutting and polishing plant operating (Danylchuk, 2015).
Despite the demise of the local cutting industry, Dominion invested CAD$600,000 in 2015 in branding Diavik and Ekati diamonds by reviving the CanadaMark, a marketing program that was suspended after the local diamond operations closed. The CanadaMark brand is a mine-to-market custody chain designed to give diamond buyers the assurance that their purchases have been ethically sourced in Canada and processed by approved manufacturers. The diamond manufacturers selected to produce the CanadaMark come from the company’s existing customer base in India and Israel, and they are continually audited to ensure sourcing and quality standards. Participating manufacturers offer the CanadaMark diamonds to retail clients who have signed up for the program.
Dominion targets the younger generation through various social media platforms and traditional advertising in print magazines. This age group is very concerned about ethical sourcing, so the chain-of-custody audit is necessary to provide this as well as the assurance that the diamond is truly Canadian.
Dominion hopes CanadaMark diamonds will eventually carry a premium over unbranded diamonds. The company’s focus group research indicates that Canadian consumers will pay as much as 10% more, while buyers in the U.S. and Europe are willing to pay an additional 4% to 5%. Chinese buyers, however, noted they were unwilling to pay any premium based on country of origin (B. Bell and J. Pounds, pers. comms., 2015).
STUDIES OF THE DIAMONDS
Donnelly et al. (2007) presented results from a study of 100 inclusion-bearing Diavik diamonds that had been selected from more than 10,000 carats of “run of mine” production. They found that 83% of the diamonds were derived from peridotitic mantle source rocks, with Mg-chromite and olivine by far the most common mineral inclusions. Van Rythoven and Schulze (2009) examined inclusions and crystal morphology in a group of 110 Diavik diamonds. They also concluded that the majority were peridotitic, and that multiple growth and resorption events had affected diamonds from the A154 South pipe.
To further characterize the production from Diavik, in 2015 GIA acquired over 777 carats from Dominion Diamond. Of these, nearly 500 carats (326 samples) were gem-quality single-crystal diamonds, with the remainder consisting of bort, which was not part of this study. The 326 gem-quality rough diamonds ranged from 1.20 to 1.80 ct, and mainly included D-to-Z range (236), brown (70), yellow (3), gray (16), and pinkish (1) colors (figure 24). Several of the diamonds contained dark-colored inclusions that were assumed to be sulfides and other minerals (figure 25). Since both studies mentioned above were concerned with the inclusions in Diavik diamonds, we decided to focus our characterization on different aspects of the diamonds. Each of the 326 gem-quality diamonds was evaluated for crystal morphology, DiamondView fluorescence, and absorption spectra (FTIR and UV-Vis-NIR).
The Diavik rough diamonds examined were dominated by octahedral forms with varying amounts of resorption (figure 26). Of the 326 samples examined, 63% (206 diamonds) showed well-developed octahedral forms with little or no resorption toward the dodecahedral form. Twenty stones were very strongly resorbed to dodecahedral forms. Two showed cube forms, and 14 others appeared to be resorbed cubes that resulted in “hopper” forms. The shapes of 22 diamonds were dominated by twinning, with 17 of those being macles. Irregular forms were observed in 43 diamonds, and an additional 19 samples showed octahedral forms but had a complete or partial coating of light or dark fibrous diamond around a gem-quality interior (figure 27). Many of the rough octahedral diamonds without a coating showed strongly etched crystal surfaces, similar to those seen beneath the fibrous layer on the coated diamonds (where the coating was broken off), suggesting that a much larger proportion of Diavik rough diamonds was coated at one time.
DiamondView imaging revealed uniform blue fluorescence in about 98% of the samples, varying in intensity from very weak to strong (figure 28). Only seven diamonds showed predominantly green fluorescence, all of which had resorbed cube-form “hopper” shapes. Three samples showed isolated patches of green fluorescence from the H3 optical defect oriented along crisscrossing linear planes within the dominant blue. The coated samples showed blue fluorescence in both the gemmy interior and the fibrous coating.
Infrared absorption spectra, collected using a Thermo Nicolet 6700 spectrometer with a diffuse reflectance accessory, revealed that all of the diamonds in this study contained nitrogen impurities and were type Ia. Total nitrogen content ranged from approximately 6 ppm to more than 1000 ppm, with only eight samples containing less than 100 ppm. Nearly 98% of the samples were either pure type IaA (dominated by A-aggregate nitrogen pairs) or mixed IaAB types with various proportions of A- and B-aggregates. Only eight (less than 3%) were pure type IaB (dominated by B-aggregate nitrogen groups), suggesting that the Diavik diamonds had not spent a long enough residence time at elevated temperatures within the earth for advanced nitrogen aggregation to occur (Allen and Evans, 1981).
UV-visible absorption spectra were collected at liquid nitrogen temperature using an Ocean Optics CCD spectrometer, integrating sphere, and halogen light source to evaluate the cause of color in the Diavik diamonds. Four UV-Vis spectral features were recorded: “cape” bands at 415 and 478 nm (causing pale yellow color), “vacancy cluster” general absorption increasing to shorter wavelengths (causing brown color), “550 nm” broad band absorption associated with plastic deformation (causes brown or pink color), and broad hydrogen-related bands at approximately 720 and 840 nm (causes brownish or greenish color) (figure 29). Based on the spectra, ~58% of the rough diamonds have yellowish D-to-Z range or brighter yellow colors produced by “cape” bands with or without hydrogen features. With the exception of one pink diamond colored by a 550 nm band and 16 gray stones colored by coatings, the remaining samples were various shades of brown caused by a combination of vacancy cluster and 550 nm band absorptions. The presence of these latter absorption bands in ~37% of the samples suggests that a significant portion of the Diavik diamonds underwent plastic deformation, likely during kimberlite emplacement and eruption.
SUMMARY
Diavik is one of the world’s most modern diamond mining operations. It is the largest diamond mine in Canada, producing approximately seven million carats per year, divided between the two owners. In June 2016, Diavik surpassed 100 million carats of production (“Diavik diamond mine: 2015 sustainable development report,” 2016). Construction and operation of the mine presented considerable challenges because of Diavik’s setting in an extremely remote arctic area that can only be supplied for eight weeks a year via a temporary ice road. The kimberlite pipes are also located under lakes, requiring an elaborate system of dikes and drainage to maintain safe mining operations. While the mine is costly to run safely and sustainably, the high quality of the diamonds it produces (figure 30) will enable it to operate at a profit until its scheduled closing in 2024.

Primarily supported by ARP for the US section, IABP also receives support from other private and public agencies in other Arctic nations. These buoys are an important component of Arctic research and will continue to be crucial for real-time meteorological predictions and sea ice research in a changing Arctic environment.
IABP has sea-ice data from 1979- present, available online. IABP buoys measure surface air pressure, temperature, sea level pressure, and ice movement. These buoys sit on sea-ice or sit in the open ocean. They have several sensors such as a barometers that measure atmospheric pressure; thermistor that measures temperature; anemometers that measure wind speed; and data loggers that transmit the data to researchers via satellite in real time. Because many different agencies contribute to the program, other agencies often add other instruments for data collection to the buoys, in addition to standard pressure and temperature data collection. Much of this data is updated daily on the IABP website and is publicly available
Buoys of the U.S. section of IABP are often deployed by extension of Naval and Coast Guard Aircraft, or by a Coast Guard Icebreaker. Researchers decide where to deploy buoys based on the geographic location of ocean processes, and where the status of sea-ice may be changing. For the most part, buoys are deployed in the same general geographic area, although the program is working on expanding to the more remote areas in the Bering Sea. Currently, IABP maintains 105 reporting buoys in the Arctic Ocean. Most of the buoys are placed on sea ice, but some are placed in open water as well. These buoys have an average life-span of 18 months.
The data collected is used for real time operations and long term research. Real time operations include collecting oceanic data for meteorological predictions. IABP buoys have helped to predict the trajectory of storms off the coast of Alaska that otherwise would have been difficult to predict. Data collected by IABP buoys is also important for forecasting sea-ice conditions, which are crucial for coastal Alaskans, subsistence fishing and those who work in the coastal commercial industry. Every summer, when Arctic sea ice retreats, shipping traffic in the Arctic region increases dramatically. Knowing the status of sea-ice is critical for navigating the Arctic ocean. Although overall summer sea ice conditions have declined , hazards still exist. A combination of sea level pressure, surface air temperature, and sea ice motion help forecasters better predict the movement of Arctic ocean sea ice.
IABP buoys can also be used to validate satellite forecasting and complement their data findings. Having real data from the ground can greatly enhance predictability and forecast estimates for weather in the Arctic. The National Weather Service (NWS) and the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) also use buoy data for weather predictions and ice charting in the Arctic Ocean. Data from IABP is also used for atmospheric reanalysis studies. Data collected from IABP is a keystone part of Arctic data collection. Much of the data collected supports efforts for the World Climate Research Programme and the World Weather Watch Programme. To date more than 600 papers have been written using data from IABP.
IABP is an extensive and collaborative project. Contributors to the U.S. section of IABP include U.S. Coast Guard, DOE, NASA, Navy, NSF, and researchers from academic institutions such as the Woods Hole Institution and the University of Washington’s Polar Science center. Researchers from private and public organizations from the U.S. as well as France, Norway, China, Canada, Japan, South Korea, India, and Russia contribute to this program.
Many organizations contributing to IABP own their own icebreakers and deploy buoys. Most recently, the US participants of IABP have been working with the Russian Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute (AARI) to deploy buoys from Russian Icebreakers. Participants of IABP meet every year to ensure that collaborative resources are being used efficiently. With so many communities contributing to the program, IABP is able to cover much of the Arctic oceans and collect an immense amount data, helping to create a large picture of Arctic ecosystem.
In the future, IABP hopes to increase the life of its buoys. The program hopes to extend the average lifespan of buoys from 18 months to 3-4 years. Additionally, the program plans on deploying more buoys to the Bering Sea and other remote areas in order to collect data.",,Author: Anonym,,,2017-07-26,Arctic Program

It sits at the top of world, covered in sea ice—a seemingly unwelcome place for life. Yet the Arctic is actually teeming with wildlife, from large mammals like walruses and polar bears to birds, fish, small plants, and even tiny ocean organisms called plankton.
The Arctic region covers much of Earth's northern pole. The outer edge of the Arctic—which includes areas of Alaska, Canada, Greenland, and Russia—is made up of glaciers and tundra (treeless plains with frozen ground called permafrost). The central part of the Arctic (around the North Pole) is surrounded with large areas of sea ice.
Because of its polar location and the tilt of the Earth, the Arctic does not have the normal seasons that we are used to in the continental United States. An Arctic winter has days without sunlight, and the summer has days where the sun never sets (which is why it's called the ""land of the midnight sun"").
Throughout the year, temperatures can span a wide range. Average lows reach -40 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter and average highs reach 50 degrees Fahrenheit in the summer. A short growing season, permafrost, and long, dark winters of extreme cold and strong winds mean the Arctic is nearly treeless and only small plants can grow.
Although the Arctic is gaining popularity worldwide as a tourism and wildlife-watching destination, the region has always been vital to the identity, culture, and survival of its indigenous people. Tribes, such as the Gwich'in people of northeast Alaska and Canada's northern Yukon and Northwest Territories, depend on the migratory caribou herds and the Arctic fisheries for food. The Yu'pik, Iñupiat, and Athabascan are also native groups to Alaska's Arctic region. To adapt to the harsh climate, they developed warm dwellings and protective clothing. Many Arctic people now live with modern homes and appliances, however, there's still a desire to pass on traditional knowledge and skills—such as hunting, fishing, herding, and native languages—to younger generations.
The Arctic is a unique ecosystem with a complex food web made up of organisms adapted to its extreme conditions. It is one of the most biologically productive ecosystems in the world, supporting many large fisheries and huge populations of migratory birds that come to the Arctic in the summer to breed.
Arctic wildlife have special adaptations that enable them to survive in their icy and changeable environment. Arctic foxes, polar bears, and caribou have hollow hair that traps air, providing them with insulation. Polar bears also have black skin to soak up as much of the sun's rays as possible. Their fur is almost transparent, but appears white due to the reflection of sunlight. Other animals change color with the seasons to blend in with the changing tundra ground cover, like arctic foxes and ptarmigans that go from brown in summer to white in winter. Some fish that live in or under the ice have antifreeze compounds in their blood, while seals, whales, and walruses have a thick layer of fat, called blubber, that helps insulate them from the cold. Migratory birds use the Arctic to feed, nest, and raise their young. Many of these birds migrate to and from all 50 states and across six continents.
A large portion of the Arctic region includes the Arctic Ocean, which is home to an amazing array of wildlife, including endangered bowhead whales, endangered polar bears, beluga whales, endangered ringed seals, and Pacific walruses.
America's Arctic includes the 19.6-million-acre Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Located in the northeast corner of Alaska, this protected area is home to more than 200 bird species, which migrate to the refuge to breed in the summer. As many as 300,000 snow geese visit the coastal plain each fall to feed on the tundra. Other wildlife travelers on the Arctic Refuge include the 130,000-member porcupine caribou herd. Each spring, the herd migrates more than 1,400 miles (2,200 kilometers) across Canada and Alaska to calve in the refuge's coastal plain. It's estimated that an individual caribou may travel more than 3,000 miles (4,800 kilometers) over the course of a single year.
Most of northwestern Alaska consists of the 23-million-acre National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska (NPRA), the largest single tract of public land in the country. The Indiana-sized reserve provides critical habitat for an incredible array of migratory waterfowl that use the four major U.S. flyways to reach all 50 states in addition to many other countries. Canada geese, tundra swans, white-fronted geese, pintail ducks, and brant are among the hundreds of species of migratory birds that nest, feed, and molt in the NPRA each year. The reserve is also home to spectacular terrestrial and marine mammals, including grizzly bears, polar bears, caribou, wolves, and wolverines, as well as beluga whales, bowhead whales, walruses, and several species of seals. The 490,000-animal Western Arctic caribou herd is the state's largest, and the Teshekpuk Lake caribou herd, numbering about 67,000 animals, is a primary source of subsistence for thousands of Alaska Native residents.
Oil and Gas Development
The Arctic contains abundant oil and gas reserves underneath its icy exterior. While exploring and extracting these natural resources is both challenging and expensive, further development is likely to continue due to improvements in technology and shifting energy policies in Arctic countries. Alaska is home to several reserves of oil and gas, some of which are already being developed, while others remain untapped.
The National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska (NPRA) is managed by the Bureau of Land Management for both the protection of high fish and wildlife values and development of oil and gas. The National Wildlife Federation is working to protect the key habitats that support the remarkable fish and wildlife that flourish in the reserve. Thanks to this work, the Bureau of Land Management finalized a management plan that takes a balanced approach to identify the most important wildlife habitat while providing for oil and gas development where it can be done responsibly.
However, government pressures to open more of the Arctic to oil and gas development threatens the wildlife and people who live there. Oil and gas companies consistently pressure politicians to open the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to drilling—which would put the wildlife who live in this largest refuge in the United States at risk. The coastal plain provides critical habitat for the polar bear. Furthermore, the indigenous Gwich'in people rely on the resources of the coastal plain, especially the porcupine caribou. Protecting the coastal plain is necessary to preserving the culture and lifestyle of the Gwich'in Nation.
The stated mission of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is to ""preserve unique wildlife, wilderness and recreational values; to conserve caribou herds, polar bears, grizzly bears, muskox, Dall sheep, wolves, wolverines, snow geese, peregrine falcons, other migratory birds, Dolly Varden, and grayling; to provide opportunities for subsistence uses; and to ensure necessary water quantity and quality."" Only Congress can designate an area as wilderness, so it is up to our elected officials in the Senate and House of Representatives to pass a bill to permanently protect this sensitive landscape for future generations.
Climate Change and the Loss of Sea Ice
Average temperatures in the Arctic are rising almost twice as fast as the rest of the world and are changing the Arctic ecosystem in profound ways—especially the rapid melting of sea ice.
The majority of the Arctic near the North Pole is covered in sea ice. The ice pack is in constant motion, drifting with ocean currents and prevailing winds. Ice is present year-round in the Arctic, expanding during the winter and retreating during the summer. Sea ice is a special feature of the Arctic, and most wildlife there depend on it in some way. Polar bears use the ice as platforms when feeding on seals. Walruses use the ice as a place to rest. There's even algae that live in the ice.
Arctic sea ice is melting much faster than previously predicted. The region is on track to become an essentially ice-free environment in summer, with a much-reduced ice freeze-up occurring in winter. Already much of the ""fast ice,"" or ice shelves attached to land, have broken up, including the 300-mile (480-kilometer) Ellesmere Ice Shelf along Ellesmere Island in northern Canada.
There is concern that melting Arctic glaciers and sea ice may raise sea levels around the globe, and that, if enough freshwater is introduced to the North Atlantic, there could be a shift in ocean currents.
Arctic permafrost is also melting, changing tundra to wetlands and shrublands. All of these changes have profound effects on wildlife and the human communities that depend on wildlife for their survival. More oil drilling will only exacerbate the challenges brought on by climate change in this region.
The National Wildlife Federation is working to stop Arctic drilling and combat climate change to stop the loss of tundra and sea ice in the Arctic.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration released its annual Arctic Report Card Tuesday, and the findings show a region in the midst of a rapid transformation. Wildlife populations are decreasing, sea ice is melting, and the Arctic is warming the fuck up. Even more ominously, the frozen soil that rings the region is now unleashing more carbon than it takes up speeding up climate change.
This year, however, the report card highlights some new points, including the impact of shifting wind patterns and how indigenous people in the Arctic are particularly vulnerable.
The clearest sign of Arctic change are rising temperatures. The average temperature over the past 12 months ranked as the second-highest value since 1900 coming in at 1.9 degrees Celsius (3.4 degrees Fahrenheit) above normal. That’s helping melt Arctic sea ice cover, which has seen rapid declines in thickness and extent. The fragile state of ice leaves it vulnerable to random weather happenings, such as when the jetstream sends warm southerly winds north. That’s exactly what happened this past year, particularly in Alaska when unusual southwestern warm winds in fall 2018 kept sea ice from freezing in along the coastal Bering Sea. This happened again in winter 2019 and continued into the spring.
“In the past when that happened, it hasn’t had a big impact because the ice is already there and very thick,” James Overland, an oceanographer at NOAA who worked on this report, told Earther. “This year, you started with thin ice, so when winds shifted around to coming from the south and bringing more warm temperatures, the ice could never form, and that was a huge change that we never expected would happen this soon .”
As a result of all this warm air—which was related to the wild ass heatwaves Europe saw this year—the Greenland ice sheet a massive meltdown over the summer. The only year worse was 2012. This presents a long-term concern for sea level rise worldwide, but the loss of sea ice throughout the Arctic threatens the culture and livelihoods of the people who live there. And, for the first time ever, the Arctic Report Card pays special attention to the impacts indigenous people face. It even includes a whole section featuring voices from the frontlines. Overland said that was intentional.
“Most of us are looking at the Arctic from satellite pictures from way above and the big picture,” he said. “Particularly with emphasis on the Bering Sea, loss of ice and these changes in the ecosystem are erratically impacting these coastal communities from the timing from when they hunt for whales and seals and so forth. ”
Sea ice loss really damages the way of life for these communities because they depend on the ice’s stability to travel and reach the waters they depend on to hunt. But the shifts in the Arctic aren’t just a concern for the people who live there. They could have a profound impact on the climate.
This year’s report also contains a major warning siren about permafrost, icy soil that stores roughly 10 times more carbon than the Amazon. Rising temperatures are causing it to thaw. That means many indigenous families are also losing access to their traditional means of storing food in ice cellars.
But for the rest of us, the impacts are also extremely worrisome. This year’s report card shows that melting permafrost is releasing carbon back into the atmosphere at a faster rate than the region’s plants are taking up. Estimates for how much carbon the Arctic is emitting range from 300 up to 600 million tons. Those emissions mean the Arctic isn’t just being impacted by the climate crisis. It’s now contributing to it.","DISCUSSION

The region surrounding the North Pole consists of a large ocean surrounded by land. This ocean, called the Arctic Ocean, is like no other ocean on Earth; and because of its special location and climate, the lands that surround it are unique.
Most commonly, scientists define the Arctic as the region above the Arctic Circle, an imaginary line that circles the globe at approximately 66° 34' N (dashed blue circle in the map at right). The Arctic Circle marks the latitude above which the sun does not set on the summer solstice, and does not rise on the winter solstice. At the North Pole, the sun rises once each year and sets once each year: there are six months of continuous daylight and six months of continuous night. At lower latitudes, but north of the Arctic Circle, the duration of continuous day and night are shorter.
But other people use different definitions when talking about the Arctic. Some scientists define the Arctic as the area north of the arctic tree line (green line in map at right), where the landscape is frozen and dotted with shrubs and lichens. Other researchers define Arctic based on temperature. Using this definition, the Arctic includes any locations in high latitudes where the average daily summer temperature does not rise above 10 degrees Celsius (50 degrees Fahrenheit).",,,,,,National Snow and Ice Data Center

Why it Matters
The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) consists of more than 19 million acres of wilderness in northeastern Alaska. The refuge includes some of the most pristine, untouched lands and waters within the United States. It has no roads, marked trails, or campgrounds, though it is open to recreational use, such as hunting and fishing. the Arctic Refuge is managed by the US Fish and Wildlife Service in the Department of Interior.
the Arctic Refuge is home to diverse wildlife, including over 40 mammals and over 200 bird species. It is a critical area for the Porcupine caribou, as thousands of them migrate through the Arctic Refuge to reach appropriate calving locations each year. Female polar bears build their dens and give birth on the Arctic Refuge’s Coastal Plain, the 1.5 million acres of land along the Beaufort Sea. The polar bears that come to the Coastal Plain are part of the Southern Beaufort Sea population of polar bears, which historically built their dens on sea ice. As sea ice continues to thin, the maternal polar bears have increasingly built their dens on land. According to the most recent research, around 900 Southern Beaufort Sea polar bears still exist in the world, which represents a significant decline in their population numbers over the past two decades.
While nearly 80% of the Arctic Refuge is protected from oil and gas development under a 1980 law passed by Congress, the 1.5 million acres of the Coastal Plain is not. The 1980 law authorized a survey of the Coastal Plain for potential oil and gas development. The initial assessment was finalized in 1987. For the succeeding 30 years, Congress did not authorize any subsequent oil and gas exploration, and the Coastal Plain maintained its natural wilderness, undisturbed by the harmful activity and pollution that oil leasing could bring. In 1998, the United States Geological Survey estimated that there were 4.3 to 11.8 billion barrels of technically recoverable oil in the Coastal Plain. Because no oil and gas exploration has occurred since the 1980s, there is significant uncertainty about the size of oil reserves in the Arctic Refuge.
However, in 2017, Congress and the Trump administration reversed course and established an oil and gas leasing program on the Coastal Plain. Without stringent environmental safeguards and oversight, this leasing program could be detrimental to the Coastal Plain and the species that depend on the fragile wilderness for survival.
The Department of Interior (DOI) is also considering expanding oil and gas development in the National Petroleum Reserve, 22.1 million acres of land in northwest Alaska managed by the DOI’s Bureau of Land Management (BLM). For more information on the administration’s actions there, visit our post on the National Petroleum Reserve.
Current Status
As part of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, Congress authorized oil and gas exploration, leasing, development, and production on the Arctic Refuge’s Coastal Plain, and ordered the Secretary of the Interior to conduct at least two lease sales within 10 years. Over the next three years, the Trump administration steadfastly pursued opening the Coastal Plain to oil and gas leasing, a process that States, Alaska Native tribes, environmental groups, and members of Congress contested every step of the way. On Jan. 6, 2021, DOI held the first lease sale for 22 sections on the Coastal Plain, half of which received bids. On the last day of the Trump administration, BLM’s Alaska branch conveyed nine of the 11 leases, totaling 437,804 acres. On Jan. 20, 2021, President Biden issued an Executive Order placing a temporary moratorium on all activities relating to BLM’s Coastal Plain Oil and Gas Leasing Program, “in light of the alleged deficiencies underlying the program, including the inadequacy of environmental review.”
History
Dec. 6, 1960 The Department of the Interior (DOI) designates 9.8 million acres of wilderness in northeastern Alaska as the Arctic National Wildlife Range. Pursuant to the order, DOI is tasked with managing the land “for the purpose of preserving unique wildlife, wilderness, and recreational values.”
Dec. 2, 1980 Congress enacts the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA). The primary purpose of ANILCA is to preserve the wilderness of over 100 million acres of Alaskan land. As part of the legislation, Congress renames the range the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and added over 9 million acres of land to the Arctic Refuge. However, Section 1002 of ANILCA authorizes oil and gas exploratory activity in the 1.5 million-acre area of the Arctic Refuge known as the Coastal Plain. Section 1002 also orders the Secretary of DOI to conduct a study of the Coastal Plain as well as the potential impact of oil and gas development and production in the area. Meanwhile, Section 1003 of ANILCA establishes a prohibition on the leasing, development, and production of oil and gas from the Arctic Refuge, unless authorized by an Act of Congress.
Winters of 1984 and 1985 As part of the exploration activity authorized under ANILCA, seismic testing is conducted throughout the refuge, leaving around 2,500 miles of trail destruction in the tundra. Though 90% of the affected tundra recovered within 10 years, around 5% of the exploration trails were still unrecovered in 2009.
April 1987 DOI completes and publishes the Coastal Plain Resource Assessment for the Arctic Refuge. The report analyzes the likely environmental impacts of five management options for the coastal plain. The Secretary of DOI recommends that Congress open the entire Coastal Plain to oil and gas exploration, assuming that only a small portion of the area will ever be leased and/or developed. The report also includes an Environmental Impact Statement. Congress continues to study the area but does not open the Coastal Plain to leasing for over three decades.
Jan. 27, 2015 U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announces the publication of a Revised Comprehensive Conservation Plan and Final Environmental Impact Statement for ANWR. The plan considers five management alternatives and recommends that Congress designate around 12 million acres in ANWR as Wilderness Study Areas, including the Coastal Plain. This would allow the Bureau of Land Management to implement policies to protect those areas’ natural conditions until Congress decides to designate them as wilderness areas. Alaska Native communities are split in their reaction to the Comprehensive Conservation Plan. The Gwich’in community supports the plan for its ability to protect wildlife and sacred lands within the Arctic Refuge, whereas the Iñupiat people do not want to restrict economic opportunities that could significantly benefit their community.
April 3, 2015 The Regional Director for DOI in Alaska signs the Record of Decision to adopt the Comprehensive Conservation Plan’s recommendations. However, without an authorizing statute from Congress, DOI cannot unilaterally begin managing the targeted areas as Wilderness Study Areas. Instead, DOI continues to manage the Coastal Plan under Minimal Management standards. These standards are intended to maintain the existing conditions of the area but are not as permanent of a protection as the Wilderness Study Area standards.
April 3, 2015 President Obama sends a letter to Congressional leaders urging Congress to act, but Congress does not pass the legislation needed to more permanently protect the 12 million acres.
Trump Era
Dec. 22, 2017 President Trump signs the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Section 20001 of the Act authorizes oil and gas exploration, leasing, development, and production on ANWR’s Coastal Plain. The Act orders the Secretary of the Interior to establish an oil and gas plan for the Coastal Plain and required that two lease sales occur within 10 years of the passage of the Act. One lease sale, for an area of at least 400,000 acres, must occur within four years of the passage of the act, or before Dec. 21, 2021. The second lease sale must occur within seven years, or before Dec. 21, 2024.
April 20, 2018 The Bureau of Land Management (BLM), a division of DOI, publishes a Notice of Intent to Prepare an Environmental Impact Statement for the Coastal Plain Oil and Gas Leasing Program. The Environmental Impact Statement is an initial step that the agency must take. The notice begins the “scoping process,” which includes a request for public comment on the scope of issues, impacts, and potential alternatives that BLM should consider when developing the Environmental Impact Statement. In evaluating the environmental consequences of the proposed leasing program, BLM must assess alternative plans for implementation of the program. For instance, the Environmental Impact Statement may include certain areas that would result in less damage from oil production or terms and conditions for leases that will minimize the damage of oil and gas development and production. However, BLM is not required to choose the least harmful alternative upon completion of the Environmental Impact Statement. BLM holds public hearings across Alaska as part of the process. Comments are due by June 19, 2018.
July 18, 2018 BLM releases a seven-page document describing a plan by SAExploration, Inc. (SAE) for seismic testing across the entire Coastal Plain (2,600 square miles). The plan mentions but does not elaborate on environmental or cultural risks implicated by the seismic testing. According to the plan, SAE applied for an “incidental take authorization” for the work that will occur near polar bear habitats. Under the Marine Mammals Protection Act, an “incidental take authorization” allows the authorized party to unintentionally “take” – meaning “harass, hunt, capture, or kill” – a small number of the protected species. In general, these licenses are used to authorize activities that may alter the polar bears’ habits.
Aug. 6, 2018 BLM makes publicly available SAE’s application for permits to conduct a winter seismic survey. This application was submitted earlier in the summer and outlines the corporation’s plan to conduct seismic testing in the Coastal Plain. SAE intends to use 3-D seismic testing. This method, which uses large vibrations to send seismic waves into the ground, will allow the company to identify potential oil and gas reserves beneath the Coastal Plain’s tundra. SAE’s estimated start date is Dec. 10, 2018. According to the application, the seismic testing will continue throughout the winter and could continue again next winter if it cannot be completed during the 2018/2019 season. However, BLM will likely need to conduct an environmental review of the plan for seismic testing which could delay the process.
Nov. 8, 2018 Defenders of Wildlife files a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against the Department of Interior, Fish & Wildlife Service, and the Bureau of Land Management seeking responses to requests submitted pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act. Since February of 2018, Defenders of Wildlife has submitted six requests to the agencies for records related to oil and gas exploration, leasing, and development in the Arctic Refuge. All three agencies have yet to provide any records, such as agency correspondence or unpublished documents, in response to the requests. Defenders of Wildlife v. Dept. of Interior, et. al., No. 18-2572 (Dist. of D.C.).
Dec. 20, 2018 BLM releases a draft environmental impact statement (EIS) for leasing in the Coastal Plains area of the Arctic Refuge, describing four alternatives. The comment period is extended through March 13, 2019.
Jan. 9, 2019 BLM postpones its scheduled public meetings on the Coastal Plain drilling plan, setting no new dates. BLM continues to work on the Arctic Refugedevelopment plans despite the current partial government shutdown.
Jan. 30, 2019 BLM reschedules public meetings on the draft EIS for the Coastal Plains drilling plan. Dates in Alaska and Washington D.C. range from Feb. 4 through Feb. 13.
Feb. 5. 2019 DOI announces at a public meeting that no seismic exploration will begin during this winter’s ice road construction season. Interior indicated that the permit application will be amended to reflect a December 2019 start date.
March 13, 2019 Sixteen state attorneys general submit joint comments alleging that the draft environmental impact statement is inadequate and does not comply with the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act – the statute that governs environmental impact statements.
July 31, 2019 Alaska Natives and environmental groups file suit against the DOI alleging failure to produce documents required under FOIA that would provide a look at how oil and gas leasing decisions in the Arctic Refuge were made. The FOIA requests—submitted in 2018 and 2019—encompass documents used to produce the draft EIS for leasing, communications and records relating to lease sale activities during the 2018–2019 government shutdown, and the Porcupine Caribou Treaty between the United States and Canada. According to the filing, DOI has not produced any documents in response to the FOIA requests and dozens of follow-up communications.
Sept. 12, 2019 BLM releases the final environmental impact statement, which allows oil and gas leasing on 1.56 million acres of the Arctic Refuge’s Coastal Plain. BLM’s chosen plan permits the agency to lease the maximum number of acres available and is the least environmentally protective of the alternatives BLM considered.
Feb. 18, 2020 The Fish and Wildlife Service seeks public comment on a federal, peer-reviewed study of the impact of seismic surveys on polar bears in the Arctic Refuge’s coastal Plain. While seismic activity threatens denning polar bears and their cubs, the study concludes that “careful planning on the timing and distribution of proposed activities” could significantly reduce potential impacts. Comments will be accepted via email until April 20, 2020.
Aug. 17, 2020 Secretary Bernhardt signs the Record of Decision, authorizing oil and gas leasing on 1.56 million acres of the Coastal Plain. Pursuant to Congress’ directive, BLM must hold the first lease sale of at least 400,000 acres by December 22, 2021.
Aug. 24, 2020 The Gwich’in Steering Committee along with conservation groups and a separate coalition of environmental organizations file two lawsuits challenging BLM’s oil and gas leasing program in the Arctic Refuge. They allege the plan violates multiple statutes, including the Endangered Species Act and NEPA. Gwich’in Steering Committee v. Bernhardt, No. 3:20-cv-00204 (D. Alaska); National Audubon Society v. Bernhardt, No. 3:20-cv-00205 (D. Alaska).
Sept. 9, 2020 Fifteen states led by Washington file a lawsuit challenging BLM’s oil and gas leasing program in the Arctic Refuge. Washington v. Bernhardt, No. 3:20-cv-00224 (D. Alaska).
Sept. 9, 2020 Three Gwich’in tribes file a lawsuit challenging BLM’s oil and gas leasing program in the Arctic Refuge. Native Village of Venetie Tribal Government v. Bernhardt, No. 3:20-cv-00223 (D. Alaska).
Oct. 1, 2020 A U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) study finds proposed oil and gas drilling in the Arctic Refuge’s Coastal Plain could impact 34 percent of maternal polar bear dens in the U.S. Arctic. USGS Director James Reilly delayed the study’s release for three months to investigate the study’s underlying science, despite the approval of top agency scientists. The Fish and Wildlife Service must cite the report in deciding whether to approve the ConocoPhillips’ Willow Project on Alaska’s North Slope in the National Petroleum Reserve.
Oct. 23, 2020 BLM releases a proposal for seismic testing in the 1002 Area of the Arctic Refuge, based on a proposal from the Kaktovik Iñupiat Corporation. Department of Interior rejected a similar application in Feb. 2019.
Oct. 26, 2020 The Kaktovik Iñupiat Corp. submits a plan of operations for seismic survey operations in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge that will provide data on oil and natural gas mineral deposits below the refuge. BLM will hold a two-week public comment period, closing Nov. 6, 2020.
Nov. 9, 2020 The Interior Board of Land Appeals confirms that the Staines River distributary of the Canning River marks the northwestern boundary of the Arctic Refuge, thus including 20,000 acres in the Refuge. The State of Alaska newly disputed the boundary in 2014.
Nov. 16, 2020 The Alaska Oil & Gas Association and American Petroleum Institute file to intervene in Native Village of Venetie Tribal Government v. Bernhardt, No. 3:20-cv-00223 (D. Alaska).
Nov. 17, 2020 BLM issues a “call for nominations” inviting representatives from the oil and gas sector to nominate tracts of land for auction. The Trump administration hopes to complete the first-ever auction and lease of the Arctic Refuge land for drilling before the inauguration of President-elect Biden.
Dec. 7, 2020 BLM sets a lease sale for the Coastal Plain for January 6, 2021. BLM is scheduling the lease sale before the end of the call for nominations period in which companies tell the agencies which areas they would like the agency to include in the lease sale.
Dec. 8, 2020 The Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) releases a report finding that pre-drilling seismic surveys in the Arctic Refuge will harass, but not injure or kill, polar bears. The report is a precursor to the agency issuing an incidental take permit under the Marine Mammal Protection Act to the Kaktovik Iñupiat Corp. for seismic surveys to assess the fossil fuel potential in the coastal plain.
Dec. 15, 2020 Plaintiffs in Gwich’in Steering Committee v. Bernhardt file a motion to prevent BLM from issuing oil and gas leases and authorizing seismic testing in the Coastal Plain of the Arctic Refuge while the case is underway. No. 3:20-cv-00204 (D. Alaska).
Dec. 16, 2020 BLM releases an Environmental Assessment (EA) and draft Finding of No New Significant Impact (FONNSI) for the proposed seismic exploration in the Coastal Plain of the ANWR. The comment period closes Dec. 30, 2020.
Dec. 16, 2020 More than 100 lawmakers, led by Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) and Rep. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.), write to Secretary Bernhardt opposing BLM’s plans to conduct a lease sale in the Arctic Refuge and seismic exploration on the Coastal Plain. In their letter, House representatives argue that the administration “cut corners” violating a host of laws including ANILCA, NEPA, and the ESA. Read the Senate letter here and the House letter here.
Dec. 21, 2020 BLM reduces the area of the Arctic Refuge available for lease by about 30%, but will proceed with the lease sale for oil exploration on Jan. 6.
Jan. 5, 2021 Judge Gleason of the District Court of the District of Alaska denies plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction that would have prevented the federal government from going forward with the Coastal Plain lease sale planned for Jan. 6. Gwich’in Steering Committee v. Bernhardt, No. 3:20-cv-00204 (D. Alaska).
Jan. 6, 2021 The Department of the Interior holds a lease sale for 22 sections of the Arctic Refuge’s Coastal Plain. Only half of the sections offered for sale receive bids, and in all but two cases, the Alaska Industrial Development and Export Authority is the sole bidder.
Jan 19, 2021 BLM’s Alaska branch conveys nine of the 11 leases sold in the Jan. 6 sale, totaling 437,804 acres.
Early Biden Actions
Jan. 20, 2021 President Biden issues an Executive Order placing a temporary moratorium on all activities relating to BLM’s Coastal Plain Oil and Gas Leasing Program. The order also explicitly grants the Attorney General authority to stay or otherwise delay related litigation.
Feb. 20, 2021 The Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) voids a permit request from the Kaktovik Iñupiat Corp. to conduct seismic testing on Alaska’s North Slope, stating that the Alaska Native corporation failed to conduct flyovers to search for polar bear dens in the area. Five days later, the Native corporation releases a statement saying that FWS never approved the corporation’s request to conduct aerial den surveys, and that “it was the agency that ran the time out, not KIC.”

The 160,000 Inuit who live in northern Canada, Greenland, Alaska and Chukotka in Russia have witnessed the changing of the natural environment as a result of global warming for almost 20 years.
It is important that you know what climate change does and means to us, for what we are experiencing now will happen to the further South in a few short years. I live in Inuvik, well above the Arctic circle, on the Mackenzie River delta in Canada's northwest territories. About 4,000 people live in Inuvik -- the northern headquarters of oil and gas development in the Beaufort Sea region. The circumpolar Arctic is not isolated anymore; globalization has reached it. The South is hungry for our oil, gas and minerals, with exploration proceeding quickly in many parts of the Arctic. The United States Geological Survey believes that 25 per cent of the world's remaining oil and gas is located here. Northern Canada is the world's third largest producer of gem diamonds; great reserves of base and precious metals and coal have been found in the North. In the last 40 to 50 years, Inuit have adjusted to social, economic and cultural changes. But even as we adapt to globalization, we realize that climate moderation is likely to be the key driver of socio-economic and cultural changes in years ahead.
In 1999, the Winnipeg-based International Institute for Sustainable Development and the community of Sachs Harbour (with about 125 people), on Banks Island in the Beaufort Sea region, documented local and regional environmental changes. In a video shown at the 2000 Conference of the Parties (COP) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), hunters and elders spoke with quiet authority about: commonplace and cumulative changes; melting permafrost, resulting in beach slumping and lake erosions; increased snowfalls; longer sea ice-free seasons; emerging or invasive new species of birds, fish and insects (barn owls, mallard, pin-tailed ducks and salmon) near the community; a decline in the lemming population (a basic food for Arctic fox and a staple species); and a general warming trend.
These changes are not unique to my region. They are also reported by Inuit in Greenland and Alaska, Saami in northern Norway, Aleut in the Aleutian Islands, Athabaskans and Gwich'in in North America, Nenets, Chukchi and many other indigenous peoples in northern Russia. Our world is increasingly changing. The traditional knowledge of how the world works, passed down from generation to generation, is less accurate than it was. Climate change is not a theoretical faraway problem for future generations to solve. It is already happening in the Arctic, which is struggling to adjust and adapt to its impacts. Communities are contending with vanishing historical sites, gravesite erosions, and community disruption and relocation. Inuit are as adaptable as others, but only to a certain degree.
Our observations helped to persuade the eight Arctic States to launch the Arctic Climate Impact Assessment (ACIA) in 2000, involving more than 300 scientists from 15 countries, and assisted by Arctic indigenous peoples. The Assessment, published in 2005, was the centrepiece of the 2005 COP in Montreal. It significantly influenced the three summaries for policymakers, issued by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in 2007, on the physical science of climate change mitigation and impacts effects and vulnerabilities, which singled out the Arctic.
Ten years ago, hardly anyone talked about climate change in my part of the world; today, climate change stories worldwide feature polar bears, seals and Inuit. Scientists and politicians are beginning to read the Arctic barometer's message: stormy weather ahead. A key conclusion of the almost 1,000-page Assessment is the projected thawing and disappearance of multi-year sea ice in the summer by mid to end of the century. The Arctic Ocean will then share similarities with North America's Great Lakes -- freezing in winter (to some degree) and thawing in summer. Since ACIA was completed, science suggests that this may become the situation by 2040 or even earlier.
Let me focus on two of the many implications suggested by ACIA about a summer sea ice-free Arctic. First, marine mammals, including polar bears, walrus and seals, as well as species of marine birds that rely on sea ice as habitat, face potential ""extinction"". The Inuit culture and relationship are uniquely related to the Arctic ecosystem, and what happens to the species directly affects our fortitude. The UNFCCC aims to prevent ""dangerous"" climate change in order to ""ensure that food production is not threatened"". Well, the threat is already here in the Arctic. The Arctic Council is presently working on ice conditions scenarios in 2020 and 2050.
Second, far easier access, particularly by sea, will be available to the Arctic's minerals and hydrocarbons, many of which are located offshore. A significant increase in general cargo transits is projected through the northwest or northeast passages, or even the Arctic Ocean. In short, climate change will promote and accelerate industrial development in a unique, fragile and vulnerable region. It is not far-fetched to foresee shipping in the Arctic, linking Europe and Asia to the western and eastern seaboards of North America, cutting off thousands of kilometres of global sea routes, which will further impact our sensitive region.
The circumpolar Arctic may well become a region of considerable geopolitical and strategic importance. Some authors have predicted mass population movements as a result of climate change. This may be plausible in tropical and temperate regions, but it remains highly unlikely in the Arctic. Nevertheless, how will the region's indigenous populations fare in a future moulded by global climate change? Firm answers are not possible, but adaptation on a huge scale will be needed despite the risks involved. The culture of Inuit and other Arctic indigenous peoples is based on their relationship with the land, environment and animals. Wholesale adaptation to an industrial future may be tantamount to assimilation that indigenous peoples worldwide seek to avoid.
The methods in which adaptation is carried out will likely reflect the relationship between the Arctic indigenous peoples and their national governments. But whatever the future holds, Inuit and all Arctic indigenous peoples will press the global community to reduce emission of greenhouse gases that are the main cause of the impact of climate change we are experiencing throughout the circumpolar Arctic and foreseen areas.
Climate Change In The Arctic: An Inuit Reality
The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) characterizes the circumpolar Arctic as the world's climate change ""barometer"". The 160,000 Inuit who live in northern Canada, Greenland, Alaska and Chukotka in Russia have witnessed the changing of the natural environment as a result of global warming for almost 20 years.
While there are many aspects of international law on which jurists of all stripes can be expected to agree, we must acknowledge that there is no single, homogenized answer to many legal questions that arise in international disputes.
The Sustainable Development Goals, having evolved from the fundamental principle of “leave no one behind”, should follow the same principle in developing initiatives at the grass-roots level.

The extreme Arctic climate makes the region a forbidding place to travel and a challenging place to live. Even so, people have found ways to explore and live in the Arctic. Indigenous peoples have lived in the Arctic for thousands of years. Explorers, adventurers, and researchers have also ventured into the Arctic to explore its unique environment and geography.
In the winter, cold Arctic temperatures and extreme wind chills make it dangerous to venture outdoors without proper clothing and gear. Strong storms can make travel difficult. And heating a home can be challenging and expensive without trees to cut for firewood. However, people have found ways to adapt, survive, and thrive in the Arctic.
Indigenous People

Residents of the Arctic include a number of indigenous groups as well as more recent arrivals from more southern latitudes. In total, only about 4 million people live in the Arctic worldwide, and in most countries indigenous people make up a minority of the Arctic population.
Archaeologists and anthropologists now believe that people have lived in the Arctic for as much as twenty thousand years. The Inuit in Canada and Greenland, and the Yu'pik, Iñupiat, and Athabascan in Alaska, are just a few of the groups that are native to the Arctic. Traditionally, Arctic native peoples lived primarily from hunting, fishing, herding, and gathering wild plants for food, although some people also practice farming, particularly in Greenland. Northern people found many different ways to adapt to the harsh Arctic climate, developing warm dwellings and clothing to protect them from frigid weather. They also learned how to predict the weather and navigate in boats and on sea ice. Many Arctic people now live much like their neighbors to the south, with modern homes and appliances. Nonetheless, there is an active movement among indigenous people in the Arctic to pass on traditional knowledge and skills, such as hunting, fishing, herding, and native languages, to the younger generation.
Arctic Exploration
Dogs provided companionship and entertainment for people exploring the Arctic. They also alerted the camp when polar bears were present. Here, dogs are approaching a polar bear as it emerges from a lead (crack) in the ice. Dogs chase the polar bear, ensuring that it does not approach the camp.

Compared to indigenous people who have lived in the Arctic for thousands of years, European explorers are relative newcomers. Europeans started venturing north into Arctic regions of Scandinavia and Russia only around a thousand years ago, with much exploration taking place in the 18th and 19th centuries.
Vikings from Scandinavia traveled to Greenland around A.D. 930, during an unusually mild period throughout most of the Northern Hemisphere. They settled for a time along the south and southwest coasts, the only habitable part of Greenland. For nearly five centuries the Norse settlements persevered, depending on their cattle, sheep and goats, as well as on seal and caribou hunts.
Contacts between the Norse settlements and the outside world ceased in the late 1400s. We now know that as the weather got steadily colder and the pasture and farming lands shrank under the advancing ice and snow, the inhabitants suffered a painful annihilation. The rapid cooling that signaled the beginning of the Little Ice Age in the early 1300s caused sea ice to expand over the North Atlantic, which made it impossible to navigate between Greenland and Iceland, trapping people in their settlements and halting trade.
Russians began exploring the northern regions of their country in the 11th and 12th centuries, and by the 17th century they had explored many Arctic islands. During the 1800's, many explorers searched for a Northwest Passage. Irish explorer, Sir Robert McClure, is credited with finding it in 1851. The first reported person to reach the North Pole is American explorer, Robert Edwin Peary. He accomplished this in 1909, however there are some doubts as to whether he actually made it or not.
People in the Modern Arctic
Many people in the Arctic today live in modern towns and cities, much like their neighbors to the south. People also work in the Arctic, extracting oil and gas from rich deposits beneath the permafrost, working in tourism, or conducting research. Other people in the arctic still live in small villages much the way their ancestors did.
Arctic people today face many changes to their homes and environment. Climate change is causing sea ice to melt and permafrost to thaw, threatening coastal villages with bigger storms and erosion. And the declining sea ice means that the Arctic Ocean could open up for commercial shipping or tourist cruises.

Arctic ice is increasingly melting during the summer months, causing new challenges for the U.S. in terms of Arctic security. For example, the decreasing presence of ice will mean new shipping lanes opening, increased tourism, and further natural resource exploration.
This means that more actors than ever before will be operating in the region, and this will present both challenges and opportunities for the U.S. Consequently, the U.S. should organize its Arctic security capabilities appropriately. The decisions and investments made now will greatly impact how the U.S. handles future Arctic security challenges.
1. National Sovereignty as the Highest Priority
National sovereignty should be the cornerstone of U.S. Arctic policy. In the Arctic, sovereignty equals security and stability. Respecting the national sovereignty of others in the Arctic while maintaining the ability to enforce one’s own sovereignty will ensure that the chances of armed conflict in the region remain low.
The question of sovereignty is also important in terms of defining actors in the Arctic. Only national or sub-national bodies (indigenous people, for example) or purely intergovernmental organizations (such as the Arctic Council or NATO) should have a role in Arctic matters. Nevertheless, due to the possibility of shipping lanes opening, some non-Arctic countries may also have a stake, however small, in the region. For example, the Chinese have applied for Permanent Observer status in the Arctic Council. However, supranational bodies such as the European Commission should be excluded from having a formal role in Arctic matters.
2. A Focus on Situational Awareness
In many ways, the U.S. is blind in the Arctic. Anyone who has visited or operated in the Arctic will agree that situational awareness of what is happening in the region is extremely important for maintaining security there. Since the distances are vast, the terrain is harsh, and the weather is extreme, achieving situational awareness in the Arctic region is a challenge in itself.
The Arctic environment affects many capabilities that are required for good situational awareness. For example, high-frequency radio signals are degraded in latitudes above 70 degrees north due to magnetic and solar phenomena. The Global Positioning System (GPS), which is heavily relied on by both civilian and military authorities, is degraded due to poor satellite geometry. Navigation charts of some of Alaska’s shipping lanes have not been properly surveyed since Captain James Cook sailed through in 1778.
The U.S.’s ability to locate, track, and identity surface vessels is limited and depends largely on collaboration with partner nations in the Arctic. Underfunding the civilian and military capabilities required to achieve good situational awareness simply makes an already bad situation worse.
3. A Comprehensive Approach to Arctic Security
In order to establish and maintain sovereignty, robust security capabilities—both military and civilian—are needed. There is a very low threat of armed conflict in the Arctic, and it is in everyone’s interest to keep it that way. Currently, the biggest security challenges arise from increased shipping, for both cargo and tourists, and increased natural resource exploration resulting from new possibilities created by melting ice.
The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) has the primary responsibility for the Arctic waters of the U.S. Although the security challenges currently faced in the Arctic are not military in nature, there is still a requirement for military capability in the region that can support civilian authorities. For example, civilian search-and-rescue and natural disaster response can be augmented by the military.
Air and maritime surveillance and reconnaissance platforms operated by the military could contribute significantly to Arctic security. It is important that there is close coordination between civilian and military authorities, as both bring unique capabilities that are needed to ensure Arctic security.
4. Proper Investment
Currently, the USCG is not properly funded to carry out the tasks that are required to keep America’s Arctic region secure and to enforce U.S. sovereignty in the region. The USCG has plans to extend its reach in the Arctic with icebreakers, the establishment of forward-operating locations, aviation assets, and vessels hardened to withstand the harsh conditions of the region. But it is unclear whether this ambition will be met with financial resources.
For example, the funding for its new National Security Cutter has been reduced in the fiscal year 2013 presidential budget request without any explanation from the White House. From managing increased maritime traffic to providing search-and-rescue capability to increasing America’s situational awareness, this platform is vital to ensuring America’s sovereignty in the region.
The USCG also needs a new strategy for icebreaking capability. Considering the costs associated with building icebreakers and projected funding levels, the USCG will struggle to procure the six icebreakers that it deems necessary to adequately patrol Arctic waters. The USCG should explore options such as buying or even leasing commercial icebreakers with similar capabilities.
5. A Role for NATO
America’s security interests in the Arctic extend beyond Alaska. Since four of the five Arctic littoral countries—in addition to Iceland—are also members of NATO, the alliance cannot afford to ignore the Arctic. Although NATO’s 2010 Strategic Concept was praised for acknowledging new security challenges for the alliance such as cyber and energy security, Arctic security was not included. In fact, the word Arctic cannot be found in either the 2010 Strategic Concept or the 2012 Chicago NATO summit declaration.
As an Arctic power, the U.S. should be promoting Arctic awareness in the alliance and could start by calling for the next NATO summit in 2014 to be held above the Arctic Circle. This would bring immediate awareness of Arctic issues to the alliance.
The U.S. also needs to work closely with Canada, which has legitimate concerns regarding NATO’s role in the Arctic. The U.S. should explain to its close partner why NATO could have a positive role in the region. Since NATO is an intergovernmental alliance of sovereign nation-states built on the consensus of all of its members, it has a role to play in Arctic security if it so chooses.
The U.S. Should Lead
America’s security interests in the Arctic region will only increase in the years to come. As other nations devote resources and assets in the region to secure their national interests, America cannot afford to fall behind. Since the U.S. is the only littoral Arctic country not to have an Arctic strategy, the White House should lead on the development of a cross-government strategy. However, a strategy is meaningless without the resources to back it up.

Article by: Hobart M. King, PhD, RPG
An Enormous Undiscovered Resource
The area above the Arctic Circle is underlain by sedimentary basins and continental shelves that hold enormous oil and natural gas resources. Most of this area is poorly explored for oil and natural gas; however, the United States Geological Survey estimates that the Arctic contains approximately 13 percent of the world's undiscovered conventional oil resources and about 30 percent of its undiscovered conventional natural gas resources.
This makes the Arctic an incredibly rich area. It is about the same geographic size as the African continent - about 6% of Earth's surface area - yet it holds an estimated 22 percent of Earth's oil and natural gas resource. [3]
Most of the exploration in the Arctic to-date has taken place on land. This work has resulted in the Prudhoe Bay Oil Field in Alaska, the Tazovskoye Field in Russia and hundreds of smaller fields, many of which are on Alaska's North Slope. Land accounts for about 1/3 of the Arctic's area and is thought to hold about 16% of the Arctic's remaining undiscovered oil and gas resource. [4]
About 1/3 of the Arctic area is continental shelves which have been very lightly explored. The Arctic continental shelves are the largest geographic area on Earth with enormous probable resources that remains virtually unexplored. The remaining 1/3 of the Arctic is deep ocean waters over 500 meters deep, and this area is unexplored. [4]

Arctic Oil and Natural Gas Resource Basins
The United States Geological Survey has estimated the undiscovered technically recoverable conventional oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids resources north of the Arctic Circle to be approximately 412 billion barrels oil equivalent. Their estimates place over 87% of the resource (360 billion barrels oil equivalent) into seven Arctic basin provinces: Amerasian Basin, Arctic Alaska Basin, East Barents Basin, East Greenland Rift Basin, West Greenland-East Canada Basin, West Siberian Basin, and the Yenisey-Khatanga Basin.
These seven Arctic basin provinces are shown on the map at the top of this page, and their resource distributions are presented in Table 1. [4] It is clear from this data that most of the Arctic area resource is natural gas and that the Asian side of the Arctic area has the highest proportion of natural gas and natural gas liquids.
Jurisdiction of the Arctic
Portions of eight countries are situated above the Arctic Circle: Canada, Denmark (via Greenland), Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden, and the United States. Six of them border the Arctic Ocean and thus have a jurisdictional claim to portions of the Arctic seafloor: Canada, Denmark (via Greenland), Iceland, Norway, Russia, and the United States.
Their claims to oil and gas beneath the Arctic Ocean seafloor have historically been determined by unilateral decrees; however, the Law of the Sea Convention provides each country an exclusive economic zone extending 200 miles out from its shoreline. Under certain conditions the exclusive economic zone can be extended out to 350 miles, if a nation can demonstrate that its continental margin extends more than 200 miles beyond its shore. Russia, Canada, and the United States are currently working to define the extent of their continental margin.
This provision has led to some overlapping territorial disputes and disagreements over how the edge of the continental margin is defined and mapped. For example, Russia claims that their continental margin follows the Lomonosov Ridge all the way to the North Pole. In another, both the United States and Canada claim a portion of the Beaufort Sea in an area that is thought to contain significant oil and natural gas resources.
Challenges of Oil & Gas Exploration in the Arctic
The Arctic is a cold, remote, dark, dangerous and expensive place to explore for oil and natural gas. The Arctic's vast oil resource and the high price of oil are what currently attract attention to the Arctic area.
Where ice-free water is available, oil can be produced from a well, placed on a ship and transported to refineries. It can also be transported by pipeline; however, construction of pipelines in the Arctic are projects of enormous difficulty and scale.
Natural gas is much more difficult to transport to market. It has a much lower energy density and must be supercooled to a liquid for movement by sea. This requires a large, complex and expensive facility that takes several years to design, permit and build. Pipeline construction for natural gas encounters the same expenses and problems as those required to transport oil.
Offshore exploration in the Arctic currently targets oil instead of natural gas. The relative ease of transport is what causes companies to favor oil.
Because of these difficulties and expenses, bringing wells into production in the Arctic requires a very large oil or gas field. The large field is necessary to support the infrastructure required to drill the wells and transport products to market. However, once an initial infrastructure is in place, smaller fields can be developed if the existing infrastructure has the capacity to support them.

Why Arctic Exploration is so Expensive
A short list of reasons why oil and gas exploration in the Arctic is so expensive... [3]
- Harsh winter weather requires that the equipment be specially designed to withstand the frigid temperatures.
- On Arctic lands, poor soil conditions can require additional site preparation to prevent equipment and structures from sinking.
- The marshy Arctic tundra can also preclude exploration activities during the warm months of the year.
- In Arctic seas, the icepack can damage offshore facilities, while also hindering the shipment of personnel, materials, equipment, and oil for long time periods.
- Long supply lines from the world's manufacturing centers require equipment redundancy and a larger inventory of spare parts to ensure reliability.
- Limited transportation access and long supply lines reduce the transportation options and increase transportation costs.
- Higher wages and salaries are required to induce personnel to work in the isolated and inhospitable Arctic.
These difficulties make the cost of oil exploration and production in the Arctic to be nearly double the cost of other areas. However, the enormous resource has attracted a lot of oil and gas activity. This will continue into the future. Interest in the Arctic will only increase as oil and natural gas fields in other areas are depleted and the cost of oil and gas rises.

Besides laying out the country’s interests and intents in the region, the white paper made official a vocabulary that sought to emphasize Beijing’s growing role as a major stakeholder in the Arctic by announcing China to be a “near-Arctic state” — argued mainly on the grounds of (relative) geographical proximity and the adverse effects that a warming Arctic would have on China’s coastal areas and various industrial and agricultural sectors. The document also sought to fold the “Polar Silk Road” — a predominantly China-Russian partnership established a year prior — into the greater Belt and Road Initiative.
Fast forward 10 months and a blue book edited by the Ocean University of China seeks to assess the country’s level of participation in the governance of the Arctic, concluding that China now has become an “indispensable force in Arctic affairs.” The months between these two documents — and the year 2018 more generally — have greatly reflected this notion, with Chinese actors seemingly more confident in their ways of engaging in Arctic affairs. Consequently, last year was a year of several firsts that demonstrate China’s regional commitment across a range of different sectors.
On the bureaucratic front, the state restructuring that took place in March streamlined, among other things, China’s polar agency as the State Oceanic Administration was effectively dissolved (save for diplomatic purposes). This led to the Chinese Arctic and Antarctic Administration (CAA) being placed directly under the new Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR). The MNR, in turn, is responsible for taking inventory of China’s natural resource assets, on- as well as offshore. As for the polar regions, the ministry will carry out the “drafting of laws and regulations” and “formulate and organize maritime, deep sea, and polar strategies.” Two internal departments, the Department of Maritime Economy and Strategic Planning and the Department of International Cooperation, have been set up to effectuate implementation. The latter department, which carries the alternative name of the Department of Maritime Rights, is assigned to guide work on matters concerning the polar regions, the high seas, and the seabed.
This latter point was reflected in 2018’s Arctic expedition, China’s ninth. The voyage was the first polar voyage to be embarked on under the auspices of the MNR and, accordingly, largely coordinated by the MNR’s First Institute of Oceanography (FIO). The expedition marked an evolution in how scientific research in the far North will be carried out in the future: one of the major objectives of last year’s expedition was the installation and servicing of an expanding network of monitoring devices across the Arctic. Described as the “routinization” of China’s science endeavors in the Arctic, this new project will make possible long-term atmospheric and oceanographic monitoring. Furthermore, FIO has been tasked with producing annual reports “indexing the natural resources” and “assessing the safety of operations in the polar regions,” further accentuating the move toward routinization. Although the reports use the label “polar,” a statement on the institute’s website refers specifically to the Arctic.
In addition, the MNR announced in December the launch of the “Arctic Environment Satellite and Numerical Weather Forecasting” project. A spokesperson for the project stated that it would “deepen China’s participation in the governance of the Arctic, and help build the Polar Silk Road.” The project, which will unfold in collaboration with various Arctic states, seeks to fill in some of the gaps existent in environmental monitoring in the region. Environmental data and forecasts will, for example, be provided to vessels operating in the Arctic. However, one such example of cooperation, the Kiruna satellite receiving station in the north of Sweden, has already run into public relations issues as fears have been expressed over the station’s potential for relaying military intelligence.
A public relations win, on the other hand, was the splash made by the Chinese delegation at the Arctic Circle Forum in Reykjavík, Iceland. And as an encore, the Polar Research Institute of China (PRIC), together with their Icelandic counterparts, opened the China-Iceland Arctic Science Observatory in northern Iceland. While originally built as an aurora observatory, toward its completion it was decided to expand the facility’s research purview to include glaciology, oceanography and other fields. The research station stands as a continuation of an already long-standing science collaboration between the two countries. It also stands as the first jointly-operated polar research station with involvement from China’s polar research institute.
Shipping and shipbuilding, as the nexus of China’s interests in the Arctic, also enjoyed a set of first appearances. Most publicized was the launch of the country’s first domestically built polar icebreaker, the research vessel Xue Long 2. The state-of-the-art ship, which is set to enter service this year, will significantly impact the country’s polar science capabilities, and act as a shiny new platform for scientific cooperation.
A second icebreaker has entered the pipeline as well. As The Diplomat noted at the time, a tender for the construction of a nuclear-powered icebreaker was issued last summer. The demonstration project, when it materializes, would make it China’s first nuclear-powered surface vessel and, in turn, make China the second country following Russia to operate its own nuclear icebreakers.
Private Chinese marine research and technology companies are also gradually seeking opportunities in the Arctic. One such company left an order for the building of a polar research icebreaker with a Dutch shipyard — the vessel is to be delivered in 2021.
As for commercial shipping, the Guangzhou Shipyard launched Boris Sokolov, the world’s first ice-strengthened condensate tanker and the first Arc7 vessel to have been built in China. The tanker, which was handed over to its Greek owner, will service the Russian Yamal LNG project. The Yamal LNG project remains the centerpiece of China’s nascent Polar Silk Road, where both China National Petroleum Corporation and the Silk Road Fund are shareholders.
The Russian Arc7 ice-notation has come to denote the fleet of 15 polar-capable LNG carriers that are chartered to serve the project at capacity. So far, six of these vessels have been delivered, all of them by South Korean shipyards. For example, it was two South Korean-built carriers that crossed the Northern Sea Route and made the inaugural LNG delivery to a Chinese port last summer.
As for Chinese vessels, China Ocean Shipping Company (COSCO) ran eight transits over the Arctic during 2018, all originating or terminating at ports in Europe. Several of these were completed with the shipping giant’s new trio of ice-capable cargo vessels, the Tian Hui, Tian You and Tian En. These multipurpose freighters, delivered by Shanghai Shipyard between 2017 and 2018, mark the first Chinese merchant vessels purpose-built for Arctic shipping. To further facilitate the development of Arctic shipping, the country’s polar science and shipping institutions officially joined hands last year by initiating a collaboration toward the development of polar navigation and hardware. China’s Maritime Safety Agency also hosted a conference under the title “Practice and Prospects on the Polar Silk Road.” The conference sought to take inventory of, and to facilitate, the development of the country’s polar shipping capabilities.
China also became party to a pre-emptive moratorium on fishing in the Arctic high seas. The head of the former State Oceanic Administration met with Norway’s foreign minister in Beijing during a Norwegian state visit in October where the two parties reaffirmed their commitment to Arctic cooperation. Additionally, the Chinese side wished for Norway to safeguard the Svalbard Treaty which, among other things, allows signatories to conduct commercial activities on the islands and in their surrounding waters. Similarly, Finnish delegates met with representatives from the Ministry of Transportation, CAA, and COSCO as part of the cooperative partnership signed between the two countries during President Xi Jinping’s visit to the Arctic state in 2017.
The blue book published at the end of last year observed that, as an Arctic stakeholder, China’s position has evolved from being a “passive rule-follower” to becoming a regional “rule-maker.” Moving forward, the authors prescribed that China should seek to more actively develop and promote “Chinese solutions” to tackle regional challenges. Looking back at 2018, it becomes apparent that the country’s participation in Arctic affairs region has grown more confident — observable, for example, in the increasingly frequent use of the “Polar Silk Road” label. While Beijing’s part in the Arctic will always be capped by its geographical remoteness, it seems intent on leveraging its metrological and infrastructural assets to boost its voice regionally.

ROVANIEMI, Finland — The Arctic is thawing, and China is seizing the chance to expand its influence in the north.
For China, the retreating ice potentially offers two big prizes: new sources of energy and a faster shipping route across the top of the world. To that end, the country is cultivating deeper ties with Russia.
More than 3,000 miles from home, Chinese crews have been drilling for gas beneath the frigid waters of the Kara Sea off Russia’s northern coast. Every summer for the last five years, Chinese cargo ships have maneuvered through the ice packs off Russia’s shores — a new passage that officials in Beijing like to call the Polar Silk Road. And in Shanghai, Chinese shipbuilders recently launched the country’s second icebreaker, the Snow Dragon 2.
China’s ambitions in the Far North, said Aleksi Harkonen, Finland’s ambassador for Arctic affairs, mirror its ambitions everywhere else. “It’s after global influence,” he said, “including in the Arctic.”
The China-Russia partnership advances both countries’ agendas in the region, at least for now. It also comes against a background of rising hostilities between China and the United States over issues like trade, territorial claims and allegations of espionage.
That tension is spilling over into the Arctic.
In April, the Pentagon, in its annual report to Congress on China’s military power, included for the first time a section about the Arctic and warned of the risks of a growing Chinese presence in the region, including the possible deployment of nuclear submarines in the future.
And this month, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo used a meeting of foreign ministers here in Rovaniemi, just a few miles south of the Arctic Circle, to assail China for what he called its “aggressive behavior” in the region and pointed to Beijing’s actions in other parts of the world.
His comments earned the diplomatic equivalent of an eye roll from many of the delegates in the room, and analysts who follow Chinese activities in the Arctic said Mr. Pompeo overstated the nature of Chinese activities in the north. China has no military presence in the Arctic, nor any territorial claims. Its activities are commercial and scientific, for now.
But Beijing has much to gain, strategically, in a warming Arctic, and it is focused on the long game. Wealthy and ambitious, it can afford to be.
China is trying to pour money into nearly every Arctic country. It has invested billions into extracting energy from beneath the permafrost on the Yamal Peninsula in northern Russia. It is drilling for gas in Russian waters alongside the Russian company Gazprom. It is prospecting for minerals in Greenland. And its telecommunications giant is eager to partner with a Finnish company that wants to lay a huge new undersea internet cable to connect Northern Europe with Asia.
The approach is not entirely new. China struck a free trade deal with Iceland six years ago, giving tiny Iceland a giant market for one of its main exports: fish. A Chinese company proposed to partner with Greenland in rebuilding airports, prompting Denmark to step in and underwrite the project instead. Another Chinese company proposed to build a port for Sweden, but backed out amid fraying diplomatic relations between the two countries.
“Arctic countries can’t say no to investments. That’s clear,” said Mr. Harkonen, the Finnish diplomat. “We want to be sure we know what China is after.”
In addition, Chinese ships are sailing the Northern Sea Route. The state-owned China Ocean Shipping Company has sent its cargo vessels across the Arctic multiple times over the last five years, and is planning more voyages this summer. A company official told a recent Arctic affairs meeting in Shanghai that the northern route cut 10 days off a trip from Asia to Europe compared with routes through the Indian Ocean and the Suez Canal.
Though the North Sea Route is still a very tricky passage to navigate, climate change is opening up that shipping lane for longer stretches of the year. The Arctic is warming twice as fast as the global average, with the average extent of Arctic sea ice reaching a new low this April, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center.
Finally, and perhaps most importantly, China is partnering with the leading expansionist power in the region: Russia, which sees the Arctic as key to its future wealth and power.
It is an increasingly vital relationship for both countries. Russia needs Chinese investment to extract the natural resources under the permafrost and monetize its long Arctic coast, especially after the United States imposed sanctions over Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea.
And so, Russia’s onetime wariness of competition in the Arctic has given way to a new openness with China.
“Though Russia and China would be natural competitors for Arctic resources and influence, they have started cooperation knowing that only together they can outcompete the West,” said Agnia Grigas, an energy expert in Washington and author of a recent book on natural gas and geopolitics. “China’s need for energy sources and Russia’s economic dependence on fossil fuel exports depends on this.”
President Vladimir Putin has met with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, more than any other foreign leader. Mr. Putin is personally cultivating investments from Chinese companies in energy and transport infrastructure across his country’s vast Arctic expanse.
In April, Mr. Putin appeared alongside Mr. Xi in Beijing to propose linking the thawing Northern Sea Route in Russian waters with China’s huge infrastructure drive, known as the Belt and Road. It could create, Mr. Putin said, “a competitive, global route” linking much of Asia to Europe.
China has provided crucial financial backing to the huge natural gas project on the Yamal Peninsula. In turn, China has secured access to what it desperately needs: energy for its hungry domestic market.
The first liquid natural gas shipment went to China last summer via the Northern Sea Route. Chinese companies have a 30 percent stake in the Yamal gas project.
There’s more cooperation in the works. China and Russia recently announced that they would set up a joint research center that would study, among other things, changes in sea ice conditions along the Northern Sea Route. And the Poly Group, a Chinese state-owned corporation, proposed in 2017 to build a new deepwater port in Arkhangelsk, on Russia’s Arctic coast.
But the relationship is complicated.
China is building a second icebreaker able to cruise polar waters. Russia, which essentially rents out its much larger fleet of icebreakers to guide foreign ships through the Northern Sea Route, is not crazy about the competition, according to a Pentagon analysis published this year as part of its annual report to Congress.
Russia has strongly opposed the idea that any foreign icebreakers could ply that route, which Russia today dominates.
Not least, the Russian military is flexing its muscle in the region, reviving Cold War-era military bases along its northern coast and modernizing its nuclear submarines.
China has said it wants to build a deepwater navy to protect its expanding interests around the world. That means, where Chinese strategic investments are made, the Chinese Navy is likely to follow.
But China, playing the long game, might have time on its side. If the retreat of sea ice continues, much larger portions of the Arctic would become navigable, making it harder for Russia to rule the waters of the Far North.
Heather A. Conley, a researcher at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington and an author of a report on China’s Arctic ambitions, said the United States had ignored the Arctic for too long. Washington, she argued, should expand its presence in the region, and it should work with international forums that bring together governments in the region.
Otherwise, she warned this month in testimony on Capitol Hill, “U.S. access to and influence in the Arctic region will diminish and our allies and partners in the region will increasingly accommodate Russia’s and China’s preferred policy outcomes.”

Record temperatures in the Arctic are benefiting natural gas exporters, who are speeding up warming by sailing more ships.
Thinning ice in the Arctic Ocean made this year’s navigation season for natural gas tankers the longest on record, the latest sign that the pace of climate change is accelerating in the Earth’s northernmost latitudes.
The Northern Sea Route, stretching more than 3,000 nautical miles between the Barents Sea west of Russia and the Bering Strait in the country’s east, traditionally opens from June through October, when higher temperatures break up ice. This year, voyages started a month early and will continue until at least the end of December. Record warmth meant slower freezing during the autumn.
“This year could potentially become a turning point for the Arctic,” said Samantha Burgess, deputy director at Europe’s Copernicus Climate Change Service. “This was a fairly exceptional year in that the warmer-than-average condition was incredibly persistent throughout the whole year.”
The length of the shipping season in the Arctic is one of the most tangible signs that the region is warming more than twice as fast as the rest of the world. In a year that’s likely to rank among the three warmest on record—if not the hottest ever—it’s the Arctic that registered the most notable increases in what is emerging as an enormous climate-related disaster.
Temperatures of more than 5 degrees Celsius above average for the first 10 months of 2020 fueled the most active wildfire season on record. High atmospheric temperatures led to an increase in water temperatures. Sea ice extent was the lowest on record for the month in July and October, and the second-lowest for most of the year. Thawing permafrost is threatening strategic oil, gas and civilian infrastructure in northern Russia, Canada and Alaska.
What’s bad for the planet is an opportunity for the $100 billion-a-year liquefied natural gas industry, the quickest growing part of the fossil fuel business. To ship the fuel across an ocean or beyond where pipelines reach, the gas is chilled to minus 260 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 160 Celsius) until it turns to a fluid.
The trade in LNG cargoes has surged in recent years, boosting the stream of tankers moving the commodity from fields in Africa, the Middle East and Australia to lucrative markets mainly in Asia. Melting ice in the Arctic reduces shipping costs for cargoes that would otherwise have to transit the Suez Canal or the southern tip of Africa.
To the west, the Barents and Kara Seas remained largely free of ice as late as November, according to Copernicus, the European Union’s climate satellite program. To the east, ice cover in the Chukchi Sea between Russia and Alaska has dropped by more than 45% since the late-1970s, according to Rick Thoman, a climate specialist at the Alaska Center for Climate Assessment and Policy.
The longer the Northern Sea Route stays open, the more LNG cargoes can head directly to Asia, where it is consumed by industry and power generators in China, Japan and South Korea. Russia and the LNG industry are working to extend that shipping season, deploying the world’s biggest icebreaker starting in October to escort tankers for more months of the year.
“Undoubtedly, such early and late navigation brings us closer to the implementation of one of the key goals of the Northern Sea Route development strategy—year-round navigation,” said the press office of Rosatom, Russia’s state-owned nuclear corporation in charge of managing the route.
The nuclear-powered Arktika is capable of breaking through ice up to 2.9 meters thick (just under 10 feet), almost a third more than the current generation of ships in the Russian fleet. That will help Novatek PJSC move LNG cargoes to market from its giant fields on the Yamal peninsula in northern Russia.
The Arktika will accompany ice-class LNG carriers to help make a path through this route and may enable a few journeys to Northeast Asia over December and through as late as April, consultants Energy Aspects Ltd. said in a note in November.
This year’s extraordinary climate conditions have already allowed for a record number of voyages to Asia through the Northern Sea Route. About 30 will be made this season, five more than initially forecast, Mark Gyetvay, chief financial officer at Novatek said in November. That compares with 17 in 2019 and four in 2018. One last ship may finish the voyage through the Arctic route to Asia this month.
For years, the gas industry and LNG exporters have promoted their fuel as a cleaner-burning alternative to coal. Novatek says its LNG plant is among the most efficient in the world, with some of the lowest carbon and methane emissions. It also uses tankers that burn LNG instead of ship oil, dramatically reducing pollution from its vessels. But while gas delivers lower carbon emissions than any other fossil fuel, policy makers worldwide are increasing their scrutiny of the business as they work toward slashing emissions that damage the atmosphere.
The LNG industry’s success in the Arctic is a concern for scientists and environmental groups, who see a “feedback loop” with more ships speeding up the pace of warming in the region. The ice's white surface reflects sunlight and helps cool the atmosphere. When it melts, it is replaced by ocean water, which is dark and absorbs solar radiation.
More shipping traffic in the Arctic also brings higher emissions of polluting gases, which can boost temperatures and soften ice packs locally, Burgess said. The presence of the tankers also increases the risk of accidents and spills in an area where biodiversity is fragile, she said.
“There’s a strong interest to take advantage of the more efficient shipping route,” Burgess said. “Equally, it’s important that there’s policy put in place to make sure that’s done legally and safely, with adequate measures put in place to protect these vulnerable ecosystems.”

_______________________
Last summer, I had the incredible opportunity to visit Arctic Alaska. It is a region that’s as vast as it is beautiful. It is also an area that’s critical for the health of our planet. Often referred to as “the world’s refrigerator,” the Arctic plays an essential role in regulating global temperatures and counteracting climate change.
But, the Arctic is in trouble.
Experiencing accelerated effects of climate crisis, it is warming at twice the rate as the rest of the globe.
And a melting Arctic should alarm everyone. These dramatic shifts are further destabilizing temperatures around the world, and threatening one of the most vital and pristine ecosystems on the planet.
Incredibly, for some, the diminishing sea ice opens new opportunity. For the first time ever, there exists the possibility of cargo traffic through Arctic sea routes that were previously unnavigable. The draw is decreased transit times compared to traditional routes. While not yet a regular service offered by ocean container carriers, transit through the Northeast Passage is a very real possibility. Test voyages completed by some ocean carriers and studies estimate the Northern Sea Route could be used for approximately 8% of total container trade between Asia and Europe by 2030, increasing to ~10% of such trade by 2050. We do not have to accept that outcome.
The science is clear. Even with regulation, substantial and irreversible risk to the environment exists in the form of oil spills, emissions, vessel strikes and invasive species, which not only impact marine life, but also the human populations that rely on a healthy Arctic ecosystem for their livelihood. Beyond that, it’s estimated that carbon emissions from shipping via the Northeastern Passage would be significantly higher due to the need for smaller, less efficient vessels and increased fuel requirements.
It shouldn’t be an option for anyone.
At Nike, we exist to serve athletes. That means protecting the future of sport by helping to protect the planet and taking climate action through Move to Zero, Nike’s journey towards a zero carbon, zero waste future. We know climate change impacts how and where our athletes train and play, and whether they get to enjoy sport at all.
If there is no planet, there is no sport.
For Nike, this means thinking about how we design and make our product all the way through to how our products are delivered all over the world – and we’ve made a clear choice – it won’t be through the Arctic.
We’ve made a commitment to not intentionally allow our products to be shipped on vessels via any Arctic sea route. And, we’re partnering with Ocean Conservancy, a leading advocate for the oceans and waterways, to encourage all companies and industries to make the same commitment through the Arctic Shipping Corporate Pledge (“Pledge”).
We’re joined in making this Pledge by Bestseller, Columbia, Gap Inc., H&M Group, Kering, Li & Fung, PVH Corp., and ocean carriers CMA CGM, Evergreen, Hapag-Lloyd and Mediterranean Shipping Company, all companies who are helping to preserve the Arctic through their commitment.
Together, we can all protect the Arctic. It’s critical to everyone’s future.

In spring, a persistent heatwave over Siberia provoked the rapid melting of sea ice in the East Siberian and Laptev Seas. By the end of summer, Arctic Ocean ice cover melted back to the second-lowest minimum extent on record. In autumn, the annual freeze-up of sea ice got off to a late and sluggish start.
But any single month, season, or even year, is just a snapshot in time. The long view is more telling, and it is troubling.
Forty years of satellite data show that 2020 was just the latest in a decades-long decline of Arctic sea ice. In a review of scientific literature, polar scientists Julienne Stroeve and Dirk Notz outlined some of these changes: In addition to shrinking ice cover, melting seasons are getting longer and sea ice is losing its longevity.
The longer melting seasons are the result of increasingly earlier starts to spring melting and ever-later starts to freeze-up in autumn. The map above shows trends in the onset of freeze-up from 1979 through 2019. Averaged across the entire Arctic Ocean, freeze-up is happening about a week later per decade. That equates to nearly one month later since the start of the satellite record in 1979.
The change is part of a cycle called the “ice-albedo feedback.” Open ocean water absorbs 90 percent of the Sun’s energy that falls on it; bright sea ice reflects 80 percent of it. With greater areas of the Arctic Ocean exposed to solar energy early in the season, more heat can be absorbed—a pattern that reinforces melting. Until that heat escapes to the atmosphere, sea ice cannot not regrow.
The chart above demonstrates another way the Arctic is changing: the average age of sea ice is becoming younger. At the start of the satellite record, much of the ice covering the Arctic Ocean was greater than four years old. Today, most of the ice covering the Arctic Ocean is “first-year ice” —ice that forms in winter and does not survive a single summer melt season. (After sea ice reaches its minimum extent each September, the remaining ice graduates to second-year status.)
Dominated by thin first-year ice, along with some older ice thinned by warm ocean water, the Arctic sea ice pack is becoming more fragile. In summer 2020, ships easily navigated the Northern Sea Route in ice-free waters, and even made it to the North Pole without much resistance.
Fortunately, summers are still not entirely ice-free. “We’ve been hovering for some time around 4 million square kilometers of Arctic sea ice each summer,” said Stroeve, a researcher at University of Manitoba. She added that she intends to examine which conditions and processes could push sea ice to the next “precipitous drop”—when the extent of summer ice cover drops to a new benchmark of 3 million square kilometers.

As other nations devote resources and assets in the region to secure their national interests, America cannot afford to fall behind. The U.S. must champion an agenda that advances its national interest and devotes the required national resources to the Arctic region. With the focus on China’s dubious and aggressive claims of sovereignty in the South China Sea, massive infrastructure investments in Central Asia and Africa, and trade war with the U.S., it is easy to overlook another aspect of Beijing’s activities in the Arctic. The Administration must continue to monitor China’s activity in the region, promote economic freedom in the Arctic, and refuse to recognize China’s self-proclaimed status as a “near Arctic-State.”
“Near Arctic State”
In the simplest terms, China sees the Arctic region as another place in which to advance its economic interests and expand its diplomatic influence. As a non-Arctic country, China is mindful that its ambitions in international Arctic institutions are naturally limited, but this has not stopped Beijing from increasing its economic presence in the region.
China’s Arctic strategy published in 2018 offers a useful glimpse into how Beijing views its role in the region.REF Running 5,500 words in its English translation, the strategy is littered with all the Arctic-related buzzwords, such as “common interests of all countries,” “law-based governance,” “climate change,” and “sustainable development.” The irony is not lost on observers of the South China Sea, where China has shunned international norms to claim sovereignty, or the fact that China is the world’s largest emitter of greenhouse gases.
Even though China’s closest point to the Arctic Circle is more than 800 nautical miles away, Beijing refers to itself as a “near Arctic State”REF—a term made up by Beijing and not found in the lexicon of Arctic discourse. In fact, extending Beijing’s logic to other countries would mean that Belarus, Estonia, Germany, Ireland, Kazakhstan, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Poland, and the United Kingdom are also “near Arctic” states. These are hardly the countries that one imagines when thinking about the Arctic. As Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has said: “There are Arctic states, and non-Arctic states. No third category exists. China claiming otherwise entitles them to exactly nothing.”REF
China’s Motivation
But even with its self-professed and exaggerated role in the Arctic, China does have legitimate interests in the region. After all, China is a global trading nation with the world’s second-largest economy. It holds a permanent seat on the U.N. Security Council. China is motivated be an Arctic actor for five primary reasons:
- New Shipping Routes. China is unique in modern times in being a continental power that is almost entirely dependent on the sea for food and energy.REF New sea-lanes in the Arctic have the potential to play an important role when it comes to diversifying China’s import dependencies.
- Economic Influence. China sees itself as a global power, and the Arctic is just another region in which to engage. China hopes to complement its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)—a vast trading network being constructed by China on the Eurasian landmass and beyond—by investing in and constructing major infrastructure projects along the emerging sea-lanes in the Arctic.
- Scientific Research. Whether it is for China’s sea-based nuclear deterrent, natural resource extraction, or commercial shipping, research on polar high-altitude atmospheric physics, glacial oceans, bioecology, and meteorological geology is important for China’s strategic interests. As a signatory of the Svalbard Treaty, China is allowed to conduct scientific research on Svalbard and has done so since 2004 at its Arctic Yellow River Station located in Ny Ålesund. China has a total of eight scientific research stations in the Arctic.REF
- Laying the Groundwork for Future Military Activity in the Region. Currently, China’s military involvement in the Arctic is limited. The People’s Liberation Army Navy has never sailed into Arctic waters. However, the director of the Norwegian Intelligence Service, Lieutenant General Morten Haga Lunde, stated recently that “[i]n the long term, we must be prepared for a clearer Chinese presence also in our neighboring areas.”REF The Pentagon recently warned “that China could use its civilian research presence in the Arctic to strengthen its military presence, including by deploying submarines to the region as a deterrent against nuclear attacks.”REF
- Access to Minerals, Fishing, and Other Natural Resources. China also sees the Arctic region as a way to satisfy its growing demands for energy and food. China is a significant investor in Russia’s Yamal liquefied natural gas (LNG) project. Beijing received the first shipment of Yamal LNG in July 2018 and will import 3 million tons of Yamal LNG every year beginning in 2019.REF The dietary needs of China’s growing population can be met partly by increased fishing in the Arctic region.REF
For now, however, China’s primary motivation in the Arctic is economic. In its Arctic strategy, China also coined the term “polar silk road.” The goal of the Polar Silk Road is to compliment China’s BRI by investing in and constructing major infrastructure projects along the emerging sea-lanes in the Arctic.REF
America’s Backyard
China is also becoming more involved in America’s backyard with an eye to investing in Greenland and Iceland, although it must be pointed out that in the case of Greenland, China’s role is often greatly exaggerated. For example, China has a license for only one mine in Greenland.
The Chinese embassy in Reykjavik can accommodate a staff of up to 500 people, underscoring the importance that China places on its presence in Iceland. The U.S. embassy in Reykjavik has about 70 people. In 2013, tiny Iceland, with a population of slightly more than 330,000 people (the population size of a small Chinese town), became the first European country to sign a free trade agreement (FTA) with China. However, Iceland has so far refused formal membership in China’s BRI.REF
Raising Awareness
The Trump Administration has used every available opportunity on the international stage to raise awareness of Chinese ambition in the Arctic. During a recent trip to Iceland, Vice President Mike Pence made Chinese economic activity in the Arctic one of the focal points of his visit.REF During the 2019 Arctic Council Ministerial meeting, Secretary Pompeo devoted a sizable amount of his speech to highlighting the threat that China poses to U.S. interests in the region, saying that “[t]he United States and Arctic nations welcome transparent Chinese investment that reflect economic interests, not national security ambitions.”REF To build on this awareness, the U.S. should:
- Continue to raise awareness of China’s questionable ambitions. China has declared itself a “near Arctic state”—a made-up term that previously did not exist in Arctic discourse. The U.S. should work with like-minded partners in the Arctic Council to raise legitimate concerns about China’s so-called Polar Silk Road ambitions.
- Check China’s desire to influence the Arctic Council. The U.S. should make sure that China does not try to exceed what it is allowed to do under its status as an observer in the Arctic Council.
- Keep an eye on China’s activities in America’s backyard. So far, China’s motivation in Greenland and Iceland seems to be more about economics and less about security, but considering the massive debt that China has left in Sri Lanka, Djibouti, and elsewhere, it is only reasonable to question China’s motivations in the Arctic.
- Promote economic freedom in the Arctic. Economic freedom spurs prosperity, respect for the rule of law, jobs, innovation, and economic sustainability in the Arctic region. Most important, economic freedom can help to keep the Arctic stable and secure. It should be the focal point of broader U.S. engagement in the region.
Preparing for Peace
The U.S. needs to champion an agenda that advances the U.S. national interest and devotes the required national resources to the region. These measures are not preparations for armed conflict. They are preparations for a peaceful future. With the Arctic becoming increasingly important for economic and geopolitical reasons, now is not the time for the U.S. to turn away from its own backyard.

The global climate is changing. The impacts of climate change are being observed earlier in the Arctic, and with more immediate and severe consequences, than in most of the rest of the world. The Arctic is warming at a rate almost twice the global average and reductions in Arctic sea-ice and permafrost and changes in weather are increasingly visible. Arctic marine mammals are uniquely adapted to life in the Arctic. Many rely on the seasonal presence of sea-ice, and all depend on the unique ecosystems and immense biological productivity of the region. Both of these factors are influenced by changing climatic conditions.
The Marine Mammal Commission seeks to increase scientific understanding of the impacts of environmental changes to marine mammals by working with and bringing together experts to discuss what the latest science shows. The Commission engages with other agencies on policy and management actions, such as assessing the conservation status of species through Endangered Species Act (ESA) listings (e.g., of polar bears, ice seals, and walruses) related to these changes. The Commission supports baseline research and environmental monitoring in U.S. waters and around the Arctic to document changes to marine ecosystems.
The effects of a warming atmosphere on physical, chemical, biological, and human components of Arctic ecosystems are myriad, far-reaching, and accelerating. The warming has caused a cascade of physical changes, from direct effects such as the melting of sea-ice and sea level rise, to secondary effects such as decreased albedo (surface reflectivity) and coastal erosion, to tertiary effects such as the accelerated warming of the ocean due to feedback loops between different climate factors.
In addition, the increase of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere has led directly to an increased concentration of CO2 in the oceans, and its chemical derivatives have caused increased acidity (decreased pH) of the water— known as ocean acidification—and “wholesale shifts in seawater carbonate chemistry” (Doney et al. 2009). At each stage in the cascade of physical and chemical changes biotic components of ecosystems are affected.
For millennia, the Arctic marine environment was dominated by the polar ice cap and its dynamics (Laidre et al. 2008, Polyaka et al. 2010, Kovacs et al. 2011). In winter, virtually the entire Arctic Ocean and its marginal seas were (and still are) ice-covered, with the ice extending into the adjacent sub-Arctic seas. In summer, the seasonal ice largely disappeared from the sub-Arctic and pulled away from some Arctic coastlines, but even at the height of summer, remained in much of the Arctic Ocean. This perennial ice was complex, varying in thickness, age, and degree of consolidation. Beyond the pervasive influence of the ice, the Arctic is also shaped by the extreme seasonal variation in day length and cold temperatures. The lack of light and cold that persist for much of the year are associated with an unproductive environment, while the constant sunlight and warmer temperatures in summer stimulate a strong pulse of productivity, without which few, if any, marine mammals would have been able to evolve and thrive there. There is still a sharp contrast between winter and summer in the Arctic but it is becoming less pronounced as Arctic warming diminishes the seasonal extent of ice cover and extends the period of productivity.
Arctic Adaptations of Marine Mammals
Arctic marine mammals have adapted to the extreme and seasonally varying Arctic environment, becoming highly specialized at using different habitats for reproduction, foraging, molting, and migration in different seasons (Kovacs and Lydersen 2008, Gilg et al. 2012, Harington 2008). Several authors have classified Arctic marine mammals with respect to their degree of specialization. Laidre et al. (2008) considered species “that occur north of the Arctic Circle for most of the year and depend on the Arctic ecosystem for all aspects of life” the most highly Arctic-adapted—these include bowhead whales, belugas, narwhals, walruses, bearded seals, ringed seals, and polar bears. Moore and Huntington (2008) split these into “ice-obligate” species (polar bears, walruses, bearded, and ringed seals) and “ice-associated” species (bowhead whales, belugas, and narwhals). For the core Arctic species, the presence of sea-ice may be both a barrier to movement and a source of protection from predators (i.e., killer whales and polar bears), storms, and extreme cold. At least until recently, competitors and disease organisms from outside the Arctic were few and human threats (e.g., from commercial fishing, shipping, and oil and gas) were largely absent (Ragen et al. 2008, Gilg et al. 2012). Environmental changes are changing all of these elements, and in the process, making at least some Arctic marine mammals more vulnerable (Lefebvre et al,. 2016, Moore 2016).
Environmental Changes and Impacts
As warming in the Arctic has progressed, sea-ice has changed in both quantity (reduction in ice extent and volume) and quality (sea-ice fragmentation, deterioration, and altered seasonality) (Stroeve et al. 2008, Wang and Overland 2009), with profound consequences for sea-ice dependent species (Kovacs and Lydersen 2008, Laidre et al. 2015). Such consequences may be in the form of both reduced fitness of individual animals and altered population parameters (Laidre et al. 2015). It is not known to what extent ice-breeding Arctic seals have the ability to switch from using sea-ice to land as a haul-out substrate or to make other behavioral adaptations to changing conditions (Kovacs and Lydersen 2008). Many Arctic marine mammals will also be affected indirectly as the food webs on which they depend undergo changes. Restructured food webs, changes in prey populations and the arrival of new marine mammal species (including new predators), competitors, and pathogens from more temperate seas will challenge the Arctic species (Burek et al. 2008, Kovacs and Lydersen 2008, Reygondeau and Beaugrand 2011, Gilg et al. 2012, Moore and Gulland 2014, Moore 2016).
The effects of climate change are expected to vary regionally across the Arctic in the degree of sea-ice loss, the persistence of intact sea-ice, and how food webs are impacted (Moore and Huntington 2008). Sea-ice loss has already been much more extensive in the Pacific sector of the Arctic leading to concern that ice-obligate species there may decline in number and/or be forced to adapt as coastal habitats disappear. In other areas such as the Canadian Archipelago, perennial ice is expected to persist longer and populations there remain relatively unaffected at present (Moore and Huntington 2008).
Although many scientists have emphasized known and expected negative impacts on Arctic marine mammals (e.g., Burek et al. 2008, Kovacs and Lydersen 2008, Huntington 2009, Evans et al. 2010, Wassmann et al. 2010, Kovacs et al. 2011, Laidre et al. 2015), some species or populations are likely to experience little change or benefit from more favorable conditions. For example, the body condition of bowhead whales has improved as the open water season has lengthened in the Beaufort Sea (Moore 2016).
Declines in the amount and thickness age of sea ice are creating more opportunities for human activity in the Arctic, with resulting impacts on marine mammals. The earlier disappearance of sea ice from coastlines coupled with the ice’s retreat farther from shore during the summer and tendency to remain offshore longer in the fall means there is now a large, growing seasonal window of open water. This creates opportunities for oil and gas exploration and development, shipping, tourism, commercial fishing, and military operations. These activities expose Arctic marine mammals to a variety of threats, including ship strikes, pollution, entanglement in fishing nets or lines, and exposure to human-caused sound and other forms of disturbance that previously either had been absent or had been present only on a much smaller scale.
If the potentially catastrophic impact of climate change on some Arctic species is to be avoided, the source of the problem on a global scale will have to be addressed. Regardless of the degree to which society and governments are able to alter the course of global warming, our challenge in the short-term is to understand the effects of climate change on the Arctic, and anticipate the impact on Arctic species and human communities to the fullest extent possible.

|· Diagram showing locations of the North Pole and sunlight for the four seasons|
The darkest time of year at the North Pole is the Winter Solstice, approximately December 21. There has been no sunlight or even twilight since early October. The darkness lasts until the beginning of dawn in early March.
Spring
The sun rises at the North Pole on the Spring Equinox, approximately March 21, and the sun rises higher in the sky with each advancing day, reaching a maximum height at the Summer Solstice, approximately June 21.
|Shadows cast in May are long, because the sun is low in the sky.||In June, near the Summer Solstice, the shadows are short, because the sun is higher in the sky.|
Summer
|In summertime, the sun is always above the horizon at the North Pole, circling the Pole once every day. It is highest in the sky at the Summer Solstice, after which it moves closer to the horizon, until it sinks below the horizon, at the Fall Equinox.|
The North Pole stays in full sunlight all day long throughout the entire summer (unless there are clouds), and this is the reason that the Arctic is called the land of the ""Midnight Sun""*. After the Summer Solstice, the sun starts to sink towards the horizon.
Autumn
At the Autumn Equinox, approximately September 21, the sun sinks below the horizon, and the North Pole is in twilight until early October, after which it is in full darkness for the Winter.
|Sun high in sky near Summer Solstice||Sun low in the sky as Fall Equinox approaches|

Alaska’s northern frontier and Arctic Ocean waters are teeming with species found in few other places, and many of them are now under threat from the oil industry and its enablers.
The Western Arctic Reserve and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge provide critical denning areas for polar bears; support vast caribou herds; and are essential nesting grounds for thousands of bird species, including threatened eiders and yellow-billed loons. The sea ice of the Arctic Ocean is hunting and denning habitat for polar bears and a foraging platform for Pacific walrus and numerous Arctic ice seal species. Under the sea ice, endangered bowhead whales and other whale species live off the biological richness of the Arctic Ocean.
Nearly all Arctic species are at risk from climate change. But that’s not the only problem: In a drastically changing environment that’s heating up at more than twice the average global warming rate, Arctic species must now contend with dirty, industrial fossil fuel development.
Save the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge
Help us stop plans to open more than 1.5 million acres of Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas drilling.
OUR CAMPAIGNS
Offshore Oil Development
Over the past decade, the Center and allies have been very successful in blocking offshore-oil development in the Beaufort and Chukchi seas through lawsuits, political organizing and media work. We successfully challenged Shell Oil’s plans to drill several exploratory wells in the Chukchi and Beaufort seas, leading to the company’s decision to abandon the effort. Obama then cancelled planned leases sales in the region and subsequently permanently protected much of the Arctic from offshore drilling.
When the Trump administration first tried to drastically expand offshore leasing in the Arctic and other U.S. oceans, including by trying to undo Obama’s Arctic protections, we sued and we won. That victory upheld presidents’ authority to permanently remove oceans from the leasing plan and caused the administration to suspend its offshore-drilling expansion plans.
We also successfully challenged Trump’s approval of the controversial Liberty project in the Beaufort Sea and have sued over the expansion of drilling in Cook Inlet, home to a critically endangered population of beluga whales. Both those projects are being pushed by Hilcorp Alaska, whose terrible record on safety and regulatory compliance we’re working to publicize.
The Center and our allies continue to battle it out in court, while at the same time pressing for a permanent halt on offshore drilling in all U.S. waters, starting in Alaska. We’ll do everything we can to make sure the Trump administration doesn’t get to finalize its latest proposal to weaken offshore-drilling safety rules specially designed for Arctic.
Oil Development on Land
In 2020 we filed two landmark lawsuits, under 24 hours apart, challenging the Trump administration's attempts to open vast areas of the precious Arctic to oil and gas. First we filed suit with allies to block a plan to open more than a million acres of the pristine Arctic National Wildlife Refuge — one of the world's most important wild places and habitat for polar bears, caribou and Arctic foxes — to oil and gas leasing. The next day we and our partners were in court again to challenge the administration's plan to lease more than 18 million acres of the Western Arctic Reserve — also called the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska — a wild Arctic landscape that deserves protection, not exploitation.
We’ve been working to save the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge since 2001, when we forced the Bush administration to release information about the impacts of Arctic Refuge oil drilling on polar bears. The oil industry continues to push for destructive drilling and sadly has convinced the Trump administration and congressional Republicans to open the area up to oil leasing, but we’re fighting to ensure it stays off limits to oil activity.
While the Arctic Refuge hasn't seen any drilling yet, the Western Arctic Reserve hasn't been so lucky. It is the largest roadless area in the United States, made up of more than 23 million mostly untouched acres — including Teshekpuk Lake, one of the country’s most important wetlands — and is home to numerous imperiled species, including spectacled and Steller's eiders, yellow-billed loons and polar bears. The Obama administration issued a plan protecting roughly half of the reserve from oil leasing, including Teshekpuk Lake.
But the Trump administration issued a new plan proposing to open up 18.7 million acres of the Arctic Reserve to oil and gas development in June 2020, including in long-protected sensitive habitat areas. Burning the recoverable oil in the region would release more than 1 billion tons of carbon pollution, the equivalent of running 300 coal-fired power plant for a year. Beyond our suit to challenge that plan, we'll continue to oppose any of the individual drilling projects it allows.
And we’ll defend the Arctic from the Trump administration’s latest proposal to weaken offshore drilling safety rules specially designed for the region’s hazardous, remote waters.",,,,,,Centerforbiodiv

The Merkel Model and Its Limits
On August 15, The Wall Street Journal reported that U.S. President Donald Trump had expressed interest in purchasing Greenland from Denmark. The subject dominated international headlines for several days. Copenhagen and Nuuk (the capital of Greenland) issued a lighthearted but clear “not for sale” message. Then the world moved on to more pressing issues, and Greenland quickly disappeared from the front pages.
For a brief moment, however, Trump’s foray into the realm of geopolitical real estate touched off a long-overdue discussion about Greenland and the Arctic more generally. The Arctic is vast, encompassing nearly all of Greenland, about one-third of Russia, and parts of several Scandinavian countries, Canada, and the U.S. state of Alaska. This makes the United States part of a small group of countries with direct economic, security, and environmental interests in the region. But since the end of the Cold War the Arctic has mostly figured as an afterthought in U.S. foreign policy. Today, that lack of attention borders on negligence. Climate change is rapidly opening up the once inaccessible region to increased human activity and economic exploitation. As the United States has stood by, rivals such as Russia and China have seized that opportunity both economically and militarily, and their intentions are not wholly benign. If Washington wants to ensure its continued access to the Arctic and safeguard its security in the region in the decades ahead, its best bet is to expand its own presence there while it still can.
Washington’s best bet is to expand its presence in the Arctic while it still can.
Climate change is affecting the Arctic at an astonishing speed. The region is currently warming at twice the average global rate. Retreating sea ice is opening new shipping routes and access to natural resources that were once beyond reach, including rare earths, fishing stocks, and—according to a 2008 U.S. Geological Survey—vast amounts of undiscovered oil and gas. For now, most of these assets lie squarely in the territorial waters and exclusive economize zones of the five Arctic coastal nations. But if current predictions are to be believed, by 2050 even the high seas around the North Pole will be ice-free several months out of the year, potentially creating disputes over access to the area that could easily create diplomatic tussles and perhaps even lead to conflict.
These changes have been some time coming. A decade ago, a White House directive noted that increased activity in the Arctic called for a stronger U.S. presence there. Successive commanders of the U.S. Coast Guard have said as much, warning that the United States lacked the necessary icebreakers, satellite coverage, and port infrastructure to protect American sovereignty in the region. But the Obama administration was preoccupied with the environmental ramifications of climate change rather than its implications for security, and the Pentagon was unenthusiastic about extending its already stretched resources to another corner of the world. Consequently, the Coast Guard’s clarion call fell on deaf ears. For the remainder of the Obama era, the United States operated under the assumption that the Arctic did not warrant a great deal of U.S. investment or attention.
Russia and China, on the other hand, recognized the region as a high priority, from the point of view of both resource extraction and security. By the mid-2000s, both countries had begun investing in the region and taking steps to protect their interests there. China, for example, established its first scientific research station on Norway’s Arctic island of Svalbard in 2004. A decade later, Beijing was investing in Greenland, with a particular focus on the mining of rare earth minerals, which are used in everything from lithium ion batteries to computer hard drives and electric-car motors. In 2016, the China-based mining company Shenghe Resources began extracting at Kvanefjeld, a mineral deposit on Greenland’s southwestern coast believed to hold the world’s second-largest deposit of rare-earth oxides and sixth-largest deposit of uranium. The Danish government made quiet inquiries as to whether the United States had any concerns about this investment, but Washington was silent.
Today China has extended its Belt and Road Initiative to the Arctic, with a project it calls the Polar Silk Road, and which includes investments in ports, railroads, undersea cables, and energy exploration in several Arctic nations. Between 2012 and 2017, China funneled some $154 million into the Icelandic economy. The Trump administration has eyed these activities with growing suspicion, worried that Beijing will use them to entangle the Arctic nations in a web of diplomatic and economic commitments. In June, U.S. officials successfully blocked a major Chinese investment in the expansion of three airports on Greenland, lobbying the Danish government to outbid the Chinese consortium.
The Arctic is currently warming at twice the average global rate.
In the near-term, however, Washington’s near-exclusive focus on China is misplaced; it must focus on Russia’s activities in the region. Russia has much to gain: it already derives 20 percent of its GDP from energy exploitation and shipping in its Arctic territories, and Russian President Vladimir Putin hopes that, as sea ice disappears, the Northern Sea Route—the Arctic shipping lane that runs from just east of Norway all the way to the Bering Strait—will come to match the Suez Canal in maritime traffic. For Asian exporters such as China, the route offers a much faster and thus cheaper passage to Western markets and allows them to avoid piracy around the Horn of Africa and congestion in the Strait of Malacca.
Russia’s ambitions would not be cause for concern if it weren’t for its view that the Northern Sea Route is within its internal waters. The United States, along with most other countries, views the passage as international waters. Russia, however, claims sovereignty over the route and requires traversing vessels to seek its approval and pay transit fees for the use of its icebreakers, navigational aids, and search-and-rescue centers. In December 2017, Moscow decided that only its own vessels could transport certain mineral and energy resources along the route. Since March 2019, military vessels traveling along the passage have had to give Moscow 45 days of advance notice—a requirement that limits freedom of navigation in the Arctic’s international waters.
Russia has amplified such worries by building up defenses along its European Arctic coastline. It has added advanced radar and coastal defense systems, opened or reopened 23 airfields, and begun conducting frequent military exercises in the region, sometimes without advance warning. Much of this activity is likely defensive in outlook. Russia naturally seeks to safeguard its waters and coastline, including its resources, as well as to monitor shipping along the Northern Sea Route. But some recent initiatives look potentially more nefarious. Russia has modernized its fleet of nuclear-armed submarines and dramatically increased their activity in the North Atlantic to levels not seen since the Cold War. The fleet’s base near Russia’s border with Finland is protected by newly added layers of air and coastal defense systems designed to thwart NATO or U.S. attacks. The Kremlin has recently experimented with a range of new weapons systems, including hypersonic cruise missiles, long-range nuclear torpedoes, and nuclear-powered cruise missiles. In the event of a conflict—in the Arctic or another region—these advancements might endanger the United States and allow Russia to block U.S. access to large parts of the North Atlantic.
While the United States has been otherwise engaged, Russia and China have begun to cooperate over Arctic security and Arctic resources. In 2014, Russia came under Western sanctions that cut off the funds and technology it needed to oil and gas from onshore and offshore reserves along its Arctic coast. China stepped into the breach, providing the money in exchange for a stake in a large liquid natural gas project and construction contracts. Putin has suggested merging China’s Maritime Silk Road with the Northern Sea Route. Moscow and Beijing have announced a joint scientific research center in the Russian Arctic, which will explore mineral and energy resources and develop technology to monitor oceanic conditions. In a region that remains hard to navigate, such scientific knowledge is power. And the two countries have stepped up their military cooperation, with Chinese forces joining Russia’s military in Russia’s Eastern Arctic for its largest exercise since the Cold War last year.
Washington has called out such behavior as needlessly aggressive. On a visit to Finland in May, for instance, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo accused Russia and China of provoking a military and economic arms race in the Arctic. But other than by issuing pointed statements, Washington seems at a loss as to how to protect its interests in the region. The United States has commissioned a single, heavy-duty icebreaker, whose operations will mostly be limited to Antarctica, and in 2018 reactivated its regional fleet in the North Atlantic, which it had dissolved in 2011. For the first time in 60 years, it is setting up a permanent diplomatic mission in Nuuk.
But with Russia and China stepping up their presence in the Arctic, the United States needs to do a great deal more. Further investments in the Coast Guard and the Navy, including in surface vessels capable of braving thick ice, would be an important first step. The United States should also fund a much bigger diplomatic and scientific presence in the Arctic and strive to become a leader in the sustainable management of maritime resources. Above all, it must understand that if it remains absent from the region, it may one day be the United States’ own Arctic real estate that is up for sale.
CORRECTION APPENDED (September 26, 2019): An earlier version of this article misstated the amount of Chinese investment in Iceland from 2012 to 2017. It was $154 million, not $1.2 billion. We regret the error.

Climate change is warming this region twice as fast as the global average, threatening wildlife and indigenous communities. Melting permafrost in Greenland and the Arctic tundra is releasing vast amounts of methane, a potent climate-altering gas.
But some see an Arctic with navigable seas in the summer and newly accessible fossil fuels as an irresistible opportunity. Cargo shipping, cruising, mining, oil drilling, fishing—all these industrial activities could expand to the Arctic, one of the last remaining wild places, and with potentially devastating consequences.
The people of Maine want in. Public and private interests in the state are working to build trading relationships with other Arctic (and Arctic-ish) nations and communities. Though there is not a tremendous appetite for Arctic mining and fossil-fuel exploration in Maine, these commercial connections could serve to establish the state as an Arctic player for decades to come.
Maine is not, strictly speaking, in the Arctic, but a few things have happened to reorient the state’s compass north. First, in 2013, the state successfully persuaded Eimskip, a major Icelandic shipping company, to move its North American headquarters to Portland from Norfolk, Virginia. Within four years, Eimskip went from biweekly journeys between Portland; Reykjavik, Iceland; and parts of Canada to making them every week, taking Maine cranberries, wood pulp, candles, and more abroad and bringing back goods like frozen fish and sparkling water. From Reykjavik, Maine goods can head to any of the ports that Eimskip services in Norway, Denmark, the Faroe Islands, Greenland, and elsewhere.",,Tatiana Schlossberg,Science,science,2019-02-12,The Atlantic

Arctic countries need to lead the cut of CO2
The hottest temperature ever measured above the Arctic circle was recorded in Verkhoyansk, Siberia this past June. In fact, the + 38.6°C reading was just one of many highs that made June 2020 in Siberia five degrees warmer than any June from 1981 to 2010. A recent Oxford University-led study shows man-made climate change due to carbon emissions made this Siberian heatwave 600 times more likely. Read more
The Arctic is warming at a rate of almost twice the global average.
Without urgent action to cut greenhouse gas emissions, the world will continue to feel the effects of a warming Arctic: rising sea levels, changes in climate and precipitation patterns, increasing severe weather events, and loss of fish stocks, birds and marine mammals.
Why it matters
The average temperature of the Arctic has increased 2.3°C since the 1970s.
By 2100, polar bears could face starvation and reproductive failure even in far northern Canada.
Around 35,000 walruses came ashore on the Alaska coast in September 2014. It’s the largest ‘haul out’ ever recorded. US government agencies estimated that 60 young walruses were crushed in the crowd.
Warmer winter temperatures have also increased the layers of ice in snow, making food more difficult to dig up in winter.
Fish stocks in the Barents Sea are moving north at up to 160 kilometres per decade as a result of climate change.
The fish are sensitive to changes in water temperature. This poses a risk for commercial and subsistence fisheries that may see fish resources move away from where they can harvest them. The moving fish also change the ecosystems into which they move.
On the tundra, rising temperatures have brought a new competitor - the Arctic fox’s much larger cousin, the red fox. Not only does the newcomer colonise their dens, it can also kill the smaller Arctic foxes.
In the ocean, both scientists and Inuit say killer whales appear to be increasing in numbers, and in the length of time they stay in the Arctic. Killer whales prey on narwhals and bowhead whales.
With increased shipping comes spill risk (both fuel and cargo), “black carbon” emissions that help to speed the rate of Arctic melting, ship noise that may also affect whales, and icebreaking that can disrupt ice crossing routes for people and animals.
In 2013, a large bulk carrier transited the Northwest Passage for the first time. In 2018, the first cargo ship transited the Arctic north of Russia.
Reduced ice cover is making offshore oil production in the Arctic more commercially viable. In 2014, the first commercial development of offshore oil (Prirazlomnoye) was pumped from Russian Arctic waters.
Our solutions
How we work
Communicating a warming Arctic
WWF brings the effects of climate change in the Arctic to a global audience, and makes the connections between Arctic warming and global impacts.
Helping highly endangered seals
As Finland's climate warms, the country is seeing less snow cover. WWF is helping the extremely endangered Saimaa ringed sealsfind suitable places to nest by creating man-made snow banks.
Planning a future for the Last Ice Area
WWF is looking at the future management of the ""Last Ice Area"", the place where summer sea ice is projected to persist longest.
Promoting renewable energy
WWF is advocating for renewable energy, and piloting renewable solutions with some Arctic communities.
Protecting the Last Ice Area in Greenland
The Last Ice Area will be essential as an enduring home for ice-dependent life. WWF-Denmark has made a proposal to include the Greenland section of the Last Ice Area on the tentative list for UNESCO world heritage.
Recommending action for walruses
The first circumpolar report on walrus conservation recommends research into the effects of industrial activities on the Arctic animals.
Surveying polar bears in Western Hudson Bay
WWF supports polar bear surveys using an innovative mark-recapture technique that does not require tranquilising the bears.
Teaching the next generation
WWF works with Students on Ice to provide high school students a first hand experience of the effects of climate change in the Arctic.

In this window of time, some of these open-water areas come to life with phytoplankton blooms so large and vivid they can be seen from space.
The summer of 2020 has been one of those summers. Phytoplankton—the floating plant-like organisms that, like plants on land, need sunlight and nutrients to thrive—have exploded in numbers, or “bloomed,” across ice-free northern latitudes. The image above, acquired on July 26 with the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on NASA’s Terra and Aqua satellites, shows a bloom of phytoplankton in the Barents Sea, north of Scandinavia and Russia.
In the Barents Sea, blooms that show up in spring and early summer are typically composed of diatoms—a microscopic form of algae with silica shells and ample chlorophyll, which makes them appear green in satellite images. By late July and into autumn, waters become warmer and more stratified. This change promotes blooms of coccolithopohres, a type of phytoplankton that turns the water milky white-green in satellite imagery due to their calcium carbonate shells. Sometimes, as is likely the case here, both types of phytoplankton show up to at once.
While blooms around the Arctic are somewhat common, new research has shown that phytoplankton biomass is continuing to increase in the Arctic Ocean. In a recent paper published in Science, researchers from Stanford University found that the rate of growth of phytoplankton biomass across the Arctic Ocean increased by 57 percent between 1998 and 2018.
The success of phytoplankton in this increasingly ice-free environment is apparent in the map above. It shows changes in the amount of chlorophyll a—the pigment used by phytoplankton to harness sunlight for making food—during the past two decades across the Arctic Ocean. The map was produced using a regional algorithm that incorporates satellite data from NASA’s SeaWiFS and MODIS instruments. Notice that most of the increase is in the Chukchi and Barents seas.
“We were certainly surprised to see that phytoplankton biomass has begun to increase in the Arctic,” said Stanford biological oceanographer Kevin Arrigo, whose doctoral student Kate Lewis led the study. “Many people have been saying that with increased melt, nutrient inventories would decline, but that is not what we saw.”
Between 1998 and 2008, the increase in phytoplankton biomass was likely the result of increasingly vast expanses of ice-free waters and a longer growing season. Since 2009, the increases have been due to phytoplankton growing in ever-higher concentrations. The implication is that nutrients might be increasing in some parts of the Arctic Ocean.
Not all areas saw increases; the waters east of Greenland stand out. Arrigo speculated that the decline there could be related to higher nutrient consumption “upstream” in waters that have become more productive. “But we would have to go there and look to know for sure,” he said.
It remains unclear how phytoplankton biomass will change in the future as Arctic sea ice cover continues to shrink. “The Arctic Ocean is changing in an alarming rate and soon may lose a lot of its uniquely polar characteristics,” Arrigo said. “There will always be winter ice, but for the rest of the year, it’s starting to look a lot like our temperate oceans.”

1.2 The Arctic region is the area around the North Pole, essentially an ocean surrounded by land. In the far north, the Arctic is mostly covered by snow and ice, whereas the southernmost part is covered by boreal forests. In between, there is a wide expanse of tundra. The Arctic is home to an array of plants, animals, and people that survive in some of the most extreme conditions on the planet and that are uniquely adapted to such conditions. Climate change, pollution, and growing resource use are factors that put an increasing pressure on fragile Arctic populations and ecosystems. More...
1.3 The Arctic region is home to almost four million people, including an increasing majority of non-indigenous settlers. The Arctic includes Greenland, Iceland, and the northern parts of Norway, Sweden, Finland, Canada, Russia, and the United States. Economically, the region depends largely on natural resources, ranging from oil, gas, and metal ores to fish, reindeer and birds. Recently, the tourism sector has also grown in many parts of the Arctic. More...
2.1 Evidence of the recent warming of the Arctic is provided by: records of increasing temperatures; melting glaciers, sea ice, and permafrost; and rising sea levels. More...
2.2 Global temperatures are expected to increase further during the 21st century. In the Arctic, this warming is expected to be substantially greater than the global average, and the following changes are expected over the current century* :
The average annual temperatures are projected to rise by 3 to 7 °C (5 to 13°F), with the greatest warming occurring in the winter months
Precipitation is projected to increase by roughly 20%.
Sea ice is expected to continue to decline significantly, reflecting less solar radiation and thereby increasing regional and global warming.
The area of Arctic land covered by snow is expected to decrease by 10 to 20%.
These projections assume a gradual warming. However, abrupt and unexpected changes cannot be ruled out. More...
3.4 By 2100, melting of Arctic glaciers alone will have contributed to a sea level rise of roughly 5 cm out of the projected 10-90cm total rise for this century.*2 Melting of the Greenland ice sheet may increase this number significantly. More...
3.5 Access to Arctic resources is likely to be affected by climate change, including: wildlife, such as whales, seals, birds, and fish sold on world markets; and oil, gas and mineral reserves.
Arctic ecosystem changes will have an impact on a global scale, notably by affecting migratory species’ summer breeding and feeding grounds. More...
4.1 The Arctic region has three main types of vegetation: polar deserts in the north, boreal forests in the south, and tundra in between. Rising temperatures are expected to favor a northward expansion of boreal forest into the tundra, and of tundra into the polar desert. More...

6. How will settlements and infrastructures be affected by Arctic warming?
Coastal communities face increasing exposure to storms
6.1 Many coastal communities and facilities face increasing exposure to storms.
Rising temperatures are modifying the Arctic coastline and are expected to change it even more in the future. Sea level rise is likely to cause flooding of marshes and coastal plains and accelerate beach erosion. Some towns and industrial facilities are already suffering severe damage as a result of erosion, and are now facing the prospect of relocation. More...
6.2 Reduced sea ice is very likely to increase marine transport and access to resources.
A further decline in the area of Arctic sea-ice will extend the navigation period and allow better accessibility by ship around the Arctic Basin and probably open new shipping routes. More...
6.3 Thawing ground will disrupt transportation, buildings, and other infrastructure
The melting of the permafrost layer poses significant engineering challenges for roads, buildings, pipelines, and industrial facilities. New construction will require deeper foundations, thicker insulation, and other preventive measures that will increase construction costs. More...
7. How will people and their environment be affected by Arctic warming?
7.1 Indigenous communities are facing major economic and cultural impacts.
The many indigenous communities whose cultures and activities are shaped by the Arctic environment are facing new challenges because of climate change, in addition to those posed by current social, economic, and political conditions. They find weather less stable and predictable, and are affected by changes in snow and sea ice. More...
7.2 Elevated ultraviolet radiation levels will affect people, plants, and animals.
The increase of ultraviolet (UV) radiation reaching the Earth’s surface as a result of the thinning of the ozone layer has negative effects on humans, animals and plants in the Arctic, particularly in the spring when living organisms are most vulnerable. More...

7.3 Multiple influences interact to cause impacts to people and ecosystems.
The ability of the Arctic populations to cope with the impacts of climate change will be greatly affected by political, legal, and socioeconomic factors such as growing populations, urbanization, or self-determination movements. More...
8. What changes are expected in specific areas of the Arctic?
In a region as large as the Arctic, there are significant sub-regional variations in climate. Recent warming has been more dramatic in some regions than in others. Moreover, local features of the natural world and societies create differences in what impacts will occur and which will be most significant locally.
The Arctic Climate Impact Assessment (ACIA) focuses on four sub-regions and considers a series of key impacts:
impacts on the environment, such as changes in habitats and in the geographic spread of plant and animal species,
impacts on the economy, such as changes in access to resources, and
impacts on people’s lives, such as effects on traditional lifestyles or damage to infrastructure.
The Arctic Climate Impact Assessment (ACIA) represents the first effort to comprehensively examine climate change and its impacts in the Arctic region, bringing together the findings of hundreds of scientists and the insights of indigenous people.
There remain important gaps in knowledge that will require improved long-term monitoring, studies of ecosystem processes, climate modeling, as well as analysis of impacts on society. The International Polar Year (in 2007-2009) will be an opportunity to improve our understanding of the impacts of climate change. More...
Climate change presents a major and growing challenge to the Arctic and the world as a whole. Implications are particularly great for future generations that will face the consequences of current action or inaction.
10.1 Resulting environmental changes will present risks as well as opportunities across the Arctic. For example, the large reduction in summer sea ice threatens the future of several ice-dependent species but will also increase marine access to resources and population centers. More...
10.2 The scenarios used in this assessment assume that changes will be gradual. However, because of the complexity of the Earth’s climatic system, major surprises are possible if climate evolves differently. Ocean currents, in the North Atlantic might undergo major changes with wide-ranging consequences for climate. More...
10.3 Impacts of changing climate in the Arctic are already being widely observed and felt. They provide an early indication for the rest of the world of the significance of climate change. The changes will also reach far beyond the Arctic, affecting global climate, sea level, biodiversity, and many aspects of social and economic systems. Climate change in the Arctic thus deserves and requires urgent attention by decision makers and the public worldwide. More...

In collaboration with the Nordic Council of Ministers, Iceland is hosting an International Symposium on Plastics in the Arctic and Sub-Arctic Region - www.arcticplastics2020.is - 2-4 March 2021, in Reykjavik, in connection with the Icelandic Chairmanship of the Arctic Council. The OSPAR Commission is one of the co-sponsors of the symposium, together with the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES), the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of UNESCO (IOC), the Marine and Freshwater Research Institute of Iceland, the Harvard Kennedy School and the International Arctic Science Committee.
OSPAR and the Arctic Council
OSPAR officially became an observer to the Arctic Council in 2017 and committed to assist the priorities as identified by the successive Chairmanships of the Arctic Council.
The OSPAR maritime area covers the North-East Atlantic including part of the Arctic area (OSPAR Region I). OSPAR believes its work may complement the work of the Arctic Council and its Working Groups. OSPAR actively engages with AMAP on ocean acidification, and transport of chemicals, providing collaboration to combat pollution from maritime disasters and chronic pollution from ships and offshore installations that can impact the Arctic from the North East Atlantic, in cooperation with EPPR. OSPAR also contributes to the work of PAME (Protection of the Arctic Marine Environment) on protecting the marine environment, as co-lead on the desk-top study on marine litter in the Arctic.
OSPAR undertakes and publishes at regular intervals joint marine assessments, the latest – Intermediate Assessment – was published in June 2017 and the next – the Quality Status Assessment – to be published in 2023, will take into account the effectiveness of the measures planned and taken. These assessments may contribute to the work of the Arctic Council Working Groups in identifying priorities for action for the protection of the marine environment. OSPAR is also co-lead on PAME’s project on “Desktop Study on Marine Litter including Microplastics in the Arctic”, contributing with its own experience in developing the Regional Action Plan for the North-East Atlantic, to minimise marine litter and microplastics originating from the OSPAR Regions and ending up in the Arctic.

Established by the Ottawa Declaration in 1996, the Arctic Council is the preeminent intergovernmental forum for addressing issues related to the Arctic Region. The members of the Arctic Council include the eight Arctic States (Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, the Russian Federation, and the United States). The Arctic Council is not a treaty-based international organization but rather an international forum that operates on the basis of consensus, echoing the peaceful and cooperative nature of the Arctic Region. The Council focuses its work on matters related to sustainable development, the environmental protection; its mandate explicitly excludes military security. Traditionally, the Council is chaired by the foreign minister of the country holding the chairmanship. Its day-to-day work is carried out by the eight Senior Arctic Officials (SAO) and six PP representatives, with input from working groups, expert groups, and task forces. To learn more about the Arctic Council, please visit their website at: www.arctic-council.org .
The United States held the rotating chairmanship of the Arctic Council from 1998-2000 and 2015-2017. More information on the 2015-2017 U.S. Chairmanship and 10th Ministerial Meeting can be found here.
Arctic Science Agreement (2017)
In May 2017, the eight Arctic States signed the Agreement on Enhancing International Arctic Scientific Cooperation during the 10th Arctic Council Ministerial in Fairbanks, Alaska. This is the third legally binding agreement negotiated under the auspices of the Arctic Council. The agreement facilitates access by scientists of the eight Arctic States to Arctic areas that each State has identified, including entry and exit of persons, equipment, and materials; access to research infrastructure and facilities; and access to research areas. The agreement also calls for the parties to promote education and training of scientists working on Arctic matters.
The geographic area, as defined by the Arctic Research and Policy Act of 1984 , covered by this agreement in the United States includes territory north of the Arctic Circle and north and west of the boundary formed by the Porcupine, Yukon, and Kuskokwim Rivers; the Aleutian chain; and adjacent marine areas in the Arctic Ocean and the Beaufort, Bering, and Chukchi Seas.
The point of contact for this agreement for the United States is the U.S. Arctic Research Commission , which can be reached at (703) 525-0113 or info@arctic.gov.
Arctic Marine Oil Pollution Preparedness and Response Agreement (2013)
In May 2013, the eight Arctic States signed the Agreement on Cooperation on Marine Oil Pollution Preparedness and Response in the Arctic during the 9th Arctic Council Ministerial in Kiruna, Sweden. This is the second legally binding agreement negotiated under the auspices of the Arctic Council. The agreement strengthens cooperation, coordination, and mutual assistance among Arctic nations on oil pollution preparedness and response in the region to protect the marine environment. The agreement is helping to forge strong partnerships in advance of an oil spill so that Arctic countries can quickly and cooperatively respond before it endangers lives and threatens fragile ecosystems.
Arctic Search and Rescue (SAR) Agreement (2011)
In May 2011, the eight Arctic States signed the Agreement on Cooperation on Aeronautical and Maritime Search and Rescue in the Arctic during the 8th Arctic Council Ministerial in Nuuk, Greenland (Denmark). This is the first legally binding agreement negotiated under the auspices of the Arctic Council. It coordinates life-saving international maritime and aeronautical SAR coverage and response among the Arctic States across an area of about 13 million square miles in the Arctic. The SAR Agreement will improve search and rescue response in the Arctic by committing all Parties to coordinate appropriate assistance to those in distress and to cooperate with each other in undertaking SAR operations. For each Party, the Agreement defines an area of the Arctic in which it will have lead responsibility in organizing responses to SAR incidents, both large and small. Parties to the Agreement commit to provide SAR assistance regardless of the nationality or status of persons who may need it.

Part One: Resource Competition in the Arctic
PUBLISHED ON OCTOBER 13
FP Analytics’ two-part Arctic Competition Power Map provides Insiders with an in-depth breakdown of how melting sea ice is enabling increased commercial activity and geopolitical competition over resources, shipping routes, and territory in the Arctic. In Part I, we visualize how climate change is physically transforming the Arctic, lay out the scale of potential resources that will be made available, and detail the positions and interests of major players in the region. We provide a thorough walk-through of why the region is gaining increasing commercial and geopolitical importance, and explicitly lay out different actors’ interests in the Arctic, from domestic economic development to securing critical supply chain. As new actors such as China establish their presence in the region, nations are forging fresh political and commercial partnerships across a rapidly changing geopolitical landscape. The impacts of these new partnerships will transform the Arctic and create major political fault lines with the potential to spark future conflict and confrontation.
Executive Summary
Rapidly receding sea ice is enabling access to a range of highly valuable resources across the Arctic. In addition to energy reserves, critical minerals, and fisheries, newly opened shipping routes across the Arctic could potentially help to re-route global trade and enable high-speed Internet connectivity between Europe and Asia. The ability to exploit newly available Arctic resources is drawing increasing interest from both commercial and national actors and is enticing nations, such as China and Japan, to pour both political and financial capital into the region.
When oil prices peaked in 2008, it appeared that a race to secure oil resources in the Arctic was inevitable. However, due to a rapid fall in global oil demand and the high cost of oil extraction in the Arctic, development failed to materialize. Instead, the dynamics of resource competition in the Arctic have shifted toward securing critical minerals, exploiting natural gas reserves, and asserting territorial control over recently opened shipping routes along the Arctic coast. Additionally, the entrance of Asian and European Nations into Arctic affairs has dramatically shifted regional geopolitical dynamics.
The admittance of Asian countries—China, Japan, South Korea, India, and Singapore—as Observer states to the Arctic Council in 2013 significantly expanded the geopolitical landscape of the Arctic. As more national interests converge there, new commercial alliances are being forged. China now looks to Russia’s Arctic energy resources as a means to diversify its energy supply, while European nations are eager to partner with Asian nations to develop high-speed Internet and shipping along the Northern Sea Route.
With new players and commercial relationships emerging in the Arctic, there has been an attendant increase in international tensions. Strengthening commercial ties between Asian and European nations, and deepening levels of Chinese investment across the region—coupled with Russia’s emerging primacy—are generating pushback from the U.S. In May of 2019, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo directly called out Chinese and Russian activities in the Arctic as threats to U.S. national interests and security. Moreover, the wider uncoupling of the U.S. and Chinese economies are making the Arctic an arena of great power competition.
Growing tensions over control of critical minerals that are essential to modern technologies, disputed shipping routes, and Chinese entrenchment across the Arctic are also putting pressure on the region’s governance framework. Consisting of an amalgamation of governance organizations and treaties, the region’s governance structures are not designed to contain or mitigate potential great power conflicts. An escalation between the U.S. and China or Russia would divide the region and significantly harm cooperative efforts toward environmental preservation and mitigation of climate change.
Part I of FP Analytics’ Arctic Competition Power Map breaks down key emerging trends across the Arctic by:
- Mapping access and control of key resource bases;
- Breaking down the public- and private-sector actors collaborating and competing for Arctic access and influence;
- Projecting the key points of geopolitical tension and the relative power positions of the actors involved; and,
- Outlining the legal landscape and governance structures in place to mitigate conflict across the region.
FP Analytics’ Arctic Competition Power Map is a powerful tool for businesses and others seeking to understand how emerging great power competition across the Arctic will help shape and influence the wider geopolitical landscape. Part II will map out Russian and NATO military activities in the Arctic and will explore materializing national security risks.

PART ONE Resource Competition In The Arctic
Introduction
Climate change has impacted the Arctic more than any other region in the world, with changes in surface temperatures increasing between two and three degrees over the last fifty years. Rising temperatures are rapidly changing the Arctic’s physical geography and allowing increased access to an immense untapped resource base of 13 percent of the world’s oil reserves, nearly 30 percent of its natural gas, a wide range of critical minerals, and fisheries accounting for 10 percent of the global catch. Melting ice is also freeing up new shipping routes among Asia, Europe, and the U.S., cutting down average shipping times between Europe and Asia from thirty-seven days to twenty-two, and shipping times from the U.S. to Asia from forty-three days to thirty-two. Resource accessibility and expansion of commercial shipping routes are increasing the Arctic’s commercial and strategic importance, as national governments and private industry move to secure greater influence in the region.
For national governments, there are both strong incentives to cooperate on trade and investment across the Arctic, as well as emerging disputes over territory and alliances that are heightening tensions—particularly among geopolitical superpowers, notably Russia, China, and the United States. Russia’s position as the largest and most economically active Arctic state, and China’s growing investment in Russian infrastructure and energy projects in the region are fueling competition and potential conflict. For Russia, the Arctic represents a critical pillar for its economic development, with billions of dollars’ worth energy and mineral resources for domestic use and export, and a means to expand its international influence through control of critical shipping routes between Asia and Europe. To date, Russia has been the nation most heavily invested in Arctic development, and many in Europe and Asia are reliant on Russian natural gas exports, which are predominantly extracted there.
Notably, China has partnered extensively with Russia, as both an importer of Russian natural gas and an investor in infrastructure development along the Northern Sea Route (NSR), which could give China access to shorter shipping routes to Europe, saving billions of dollars in shipping costs and strengthening commercial ties to Europe. The opening of the NSR would also benefit Europe, granting easier access to China—its second-largest commercial trade market—and paving the way for high-speed digital connectivity between the two continents by way of submarine Internet cables along the NSR seabed. While not commonly reported, undersea Internet cables will play a crucial role in spurring future tech-based industrial growth in the Arctic, as well as in boosting Arctic nations’ defense capabilities by enabling the monitoring of both the Arctic seabed and cyberspace communications. For the U.S., there is potential to access a range of resources, including critical minerals such as rare earths, copper, and phosphorus. Beyond the potential for resource extraction, the U.S. government views the Arctic as an arena for countering Russian and Chinese international influence and is now seeking to establish a stronger presence in the region for deterrence, as articulated in the Pentagon’s June 2019 Department of Defense Arctic Strategy report to Congress.
As these resource plays and global trends play out, competition in the Arctic is set to be a multi-dimensional and evolving power struggle with commercial and geopolitical implications. In Part I of this two-part Power Map series, we break down the current state of this competition, outline how different actors are positioning themselves, and explore the implications for companies, national governments and the environment.
The Impact of Climate Change and Rapidly Expanding Access to Arctic Resources
While there is no universally agreed-upon definition of what territory constitutes the Arctic, it is generally understood to be the northernmost part of the Earth that lies above the 66°33′ north latitude line in the region referred to as the “Arctic Circle.” This region has played a number of historically significant roles, from Britain’s early attempts to find the Northwest Passage, to Russia’s militarization of the Arctic throughout the Cold War. Today, the impacts of climate change are making this region more critical to global commerce and geopolitics than ever as sea ice melt rapidly degrades natural habitats within the Arctic and makes abundant natural resources more readily available. Russia, China, the U.S., Europe, and other nations are intensifying their focus on the Arctic. Apart from Europe, these three other global powers have each released updated Arctic strategy policy documents in the past three years and have recently deployed commercial, scientific, and/or military expeditions in the Arctic. The large stores of oil, natural gas, minerals, and fisheries held in the Arctic are becoming increasingly accessible, drawing interest from national actors and private industry, while generating pushback from conservation groups that hope to prevent further exploitation of the region and its Indigenous peoples.
Key Takeaways
The Issue
The Arctic today provides an estimated $281 billion worth of food, minerals, oil, and gas, and climate change is set to increase the economic opportunities across these industries as well as provide new commercial shipping routes. The promise of these resources is attracting national and private interests to the Arctic while threatening Indigenous communities and local ecosystems.
The Reaction
The abundant resources held in the Arctic have generated interest from myriad commercial and national actors looking to seize on and strengthen regional energy, food, and technology supply chains. These resources include roughly a quarter of the world’s untapped and accessible energy resources, fisheries that currently generate an average of $560 million annually and are set to increase up to thirty-seven times in size due to climate-driven migration, and an estimated two trillion dollars’ worth of minerals held in the Russian Arctic alone.
What’s at Stake
Commercial industry stands to gain access to billions of dollars’ worth of resources—in the forms of oil, natural gas, critical minerals, and fisheries—while increased economic activity in the Arctic will simultaneously accelerate sea ice melt, ocean acidification, and rising temperatures. The economic potential the Arctic holds is also aggravating political tensions among Arctic nations, Indigenous populations, and environmental groups. While resource extraction in the Arctic is still costly and potentially dangerous due to an inhospitable environment, the increasing global demand for critical minerals and seafood supplies provided by fisheries continues to drive investment into the region.

- GRAPHIC 2: Arctic Timeline
- GRAPHIC 3: Oil And Gas Basins In The Arctic
Changes in surface temperatures in the Arctic are more significant than anywhere else in the world, increasing by two to three degrees over the last fifty years, leading to a drastic reduction in sea ice covering the Arctic in both the winter and summer months, at an average rate of 12.9 percent per year. Record low extents of sea ice were recorded in 2012, with 2019’s sea ice extent being the second lowest recorded since 1979. At its current rate of decline, current projections put the Arctic as being ice-free in most late summers as soon as the 2030s. The rapid decline of Arctic sea ice is drawing commercial and national interests towards the Arctic, looking to exploit both its natural resources and new shipping routes that are opening through the region. In the summer of 2020, the two most important shipping routes through the Arctic—the Northern Sea Route and the Northwest Passage—were open and ice-free for weeks. The Northern Sea Route would connect China and Europe, and potentially reroute shipping trade from the Suez Canal. It is critical to Russia’s plans to develop the Arctic, as well as China’s aspirations there.
Despite the allure of vast resources and potential for increased trade and investment between continents, some Arctic resources are still exceedingly difficult to access. For example, multibillion-dollar energy investments from Cairn Energy, in 2014, and Shell, in 2017, yielded no oil—and a precipitous fall in the price of oil since 2014 has made this type of high-cost, high-risk investment increasingly unattractive. Access challenges and low market prices have changed the calculus and are deterring oil exploration in the Arctic, but geopolitics and increased global demand continue to drive investment in natural gas and mineral exploitation.
China’s voracious energy consumption continues to drive its investment in Russian Arctic energy supplies. China has been the largest contributor to global energy consumption growth every year since 2000, accounting for 24 percent of global energy consumption in 2018, and despite its economic slowdown, diversifying energy supplies from the Arctic remains a strategic imperative. Growing demand for resources is catalyzing Chinese investment in the region more broadly, and Arctic nations are eager to capitalize on these capital inflows. The competitive dynamics of the Arctic’s major natural-resource bases are broken down below.

Energy: Russia Capitalizing on Natural Gas Reserves While Oil Fails to Attract Investment
Energy companies have a long history of Arctic activity, starting with the discovery of oil in Siberia by the Soviet Union in 1962. However, climate change, new technologies, and a 2008 report by the United States Geological Survey—estimating that the Arctic contained nearly one-quarter of the earth’s undiscovered recoverable petroleum resources—ushered in a new era of oil prospecting in the region with nineteen major oil and gas companies active in the Arctic, including BP, ExxonMobil, and Shell. However, commercial oil competition has failed to materialize due to disappointing returns on investment, as none of the fourteen offshore oil wells drilled in the Arctic has yielded economically profitable quantities of oil. Global oil and gas price declines of over 50 percent since 2014 have made the cost and difficulty of extracting oil an economically unfeasible investment. Natural gas extraction still plays a critical role in Arctic development for Russia, Norway, and Canada, but global commodity prices, coupled with the U.S. shale revolution, which has increased U.S. oil and gas production 57 percent since 2010, have deterred extensive natural gas investment by most Arctic nations and outside commercial interests.
For Russia, natural gas represents the backbone of its economic and geopolitical future. It is the world’s second-largest producer of natural gas (after the U.S.) and Europe’s largest natural gas supplier, with fourteen European countries importing more than 50 percent of their natural gas from Russia. Production is concentrated in the Arctic, with roughly 85 percent coming from northern West Siberia in Russia’s Arctic. Russia’s strategic geographic position allows it to supply natural gas directly to Europe and Asia, which it is leveraging to develop two major gas pipelines—the Nord Stream 2 (connecting to Europe) and the Power of Siberia (connecting to China). The Power of Siberia gas pipeline began directly supplying China with Russian natural gas reserves in 2019 and is a key point of cooperation between the two countries in the Arctic. While other Asian countries such as Japan and South Korea have also invested in Russian natural gas, the closer economic ties between China and Russia are the focus of growing geopolitical concern, heightening energy security risks among European importers and U.S. natural gas exporters.

Arctic Timeline
1962
First Major Arctic Energy Find in Siberia
The Soviet Union discovers the first oil and gas fields in the Arctic in Western Siberia. The energy resources in this region remain largely unexploited today, but with tens of trillions of cubic meters of natural gas, it holds the largest reserves on earth. If fully developed, it could potentially supply enough energy to power all of Europe for decades beyond 2020.
March 12, 1968
Oil Discovered on Alaska’s North Slope
Arco and Humble Oil discover the Prudhoe Bay oil field on the North Slope of Alaska, about 250 miles north of the Arctic Circle. Containing thirteen billion recoverable barrels of oil, it is one of the single largest oil fields discovered in North America.
November 12, 1969
Supertanker Completes First Navigation of the Northwest Passage
A U.S. merchant ship, the SS Manhattan, completes the 4,400-mile voyage along the Northwest Passage. The ship transports a lone symbolic barrel of Alaskan oil from the Pacific Ocean through Canada’s Arctic waters and finishes its trip in New York.
December 10, 1982
The UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) Establishes Ocean Governance
The UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) codifies hundreds of years of maritime customs into an overarching governance system for the world’s oceans and its ocean resources. To date, 167 states have ratified UNCLOS. However, the U.S. remains one of the few nations to abstain.
September 19, 1996
The Arctic Council Is Established
The signing of the Ottawa Declaration by the eight Arctic states (Russia, Canada, the U.S., Norway, Iceland, Denmark (Greenland), Sweden, Finland) officially creates the Arctic Council. As the central international organization for Arctic cooperation and governance, the Arctic Council is designed to address common regional issues related to environmental protection and sustainable development. However, it does not address issues related to fishing and military security. In addition to the eight Arctic Nations, the organization includes six Indigenous peoples’ groups, named the “Permanent Participants,” and twelve non-Arctic observer states. Read more
September 16, 2007
Arctic Sea Ice Levels Reach Record Lows
Arctic sea ice retreats to its lowest level since satellite imaging began in 1979, sparking debate over climate change and environmental preservation. Melting sea ice levels also attract new economic interest in the region, bringing hope that receding ice will enable access to previously unexploitable energy resources and shipping routes.
July 23, 2008
New Research Illuminates the Extent of Untapped Arctic Resources
The U.S. Geological Survey issues a comprehensive appraisal of Arctic’s untapped energy resources. The survey estimates that the Arctic holds nearly a quarter of the earth’s undiscovered, recoverable oil and natural gas.
September 6, 2008
Arctic Maritime Routes Unlocking
For a few days in the summertime, parts of the Northwest Passage (along Canada’s Arctic coastline) and the Northern Sea Route (along Russia’s Arctic coastline) are both navigable for the first time since satellite imaging began. Easier navigation of these sea routes could potentially reshape ocean shipping trade globally.
August 30, 2011
First Supertanker Transits the Northern Sea Route
The Russian supertanker Vladimir Tikhonov becomes the first ship to navigate the entire Northern Sea Route. The state-owned vessel completes the transit in less than eight days, a record, and with little help from icebreakers. Weeks later, the Japanese-owned Sanko Odyssey becomes the largest bulk carrier ship to complete the journey.
September 16, 2012
Sea Ice Retreat Shatters Record for Previous Low
Arctic Sea ice recedes to a new low, melting to 1.32 million square miles, roughly a quarter of the surface of the Arctic Ocean. The rapid thaw vastly surpasses the two previous records.
December 5, 2012
World’s First LNG Supply Delivered Via the Northern Sea Route
A liquefied natural gas carrier, the ice-capable Ob River, successfully navigates the Northern Sea Route, sailing from Norway to Japan. By completing the journey, the ship becomes the first to successfully move LNG between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans using Arctic waters.
March 22, 2013
China and Russian Reach New Energy Deal
Russian state-owned oil company Rosneft and the China National Petroleum Corporation agree to partner in the energy exploration of three areas in the Arctic. The deal is the first of its kind between the Kremlin and an Asian company and is expected to lay the groundwork for future Chinese investment in Russian Arctic energy resources. Read more
May 10, 2013
First Asian States Join the Arctic Council as Observers
The Arctic Council adds China, India, Italy, Japan, Singapore, and South Korea as observer states (joining the UK, Netherlands, Poland, Spain, Germany, and France). The admittance of Asian nations into the Arctic Council has been a major catalyst for new commercial connections as well as debates of the future of the region’s economic development and governance.

Oil And Gas Basins In The Arctic
The major discovered and accessible oil and gas basins in the Arctic are mapped below.
Minerals: Critical Minerals Set to Drive Future Investment from the U.S., China, and Russia
Mining represents the leading and most valuable economic sector in the Arctic. Abundant and significant deposits of zinc, iron ore, silver, lead, nickel, copper, coal, gold, uranium, tungsten, diamonds, rare-earth elements, and other critical minerals remain untapped. Russia has the largest mineral extraction operations in the Arctic—and holds an estimated $1.5 to 2 trillion worth of unmined mineral reserves—with Canada and the U.S. also engaging in extensive mining operations. Interest in mineral resources is intensifying, particularly due to their essential roles in a range of advanced technologies. Since the early 2000s, strong demand for zinc, iron ore, copper, silver, lead, and diamonds, notably from developing Asian economies—has pushed up prices and drawn in prospectors. Attention is now turning to previously inaccessible rare-earth elements, key inputs for the manufacturing of modern technologies from smart phones to defense applications.
While energy investments draw Russia and China closer, the dynamics over minerals are more nuanced. Russia’s state-owned Far East Development Fund is creating a $1 billion joint mining venture fund with China National Gold Group, a government-controlled producer of the precious metals. At the same time, Russia is pushing to end its reliance on China for rare earths—Russia plans to invest $1.5 billion over the next ten years to become “self-sufficient,” a goal similarly articulated by the U.S. However, China dominates rare-earth elements’ production and global supply chains, and its position will be difficult to challenge. It is currently home to 63 percent of global production of these elements and is heavily investing in mining activities across the Arctic (and elsewhere around the globe). Despite U.S. ambitions, it lacks the processing capabilities to refine rare earths domestically and relies on China for 80 percent of its rare earth supply, with China continuing to wield the valuable resources as geostrategic weapons. In May of 2019, China threatened to cut off rare earth supplies to the U.S. due to mounting trade tensions, driving the Pentagon (once again) to seek alternatives. As these and other countries around the world seek to ramp up their rare earth and other critical minerals production, the Arctic will become an arena for that competition.
Fisheries: Warming Oceans Enabling Rampant Exploitation of Arctic Fisheries
A central industry for many Arctic nations, regional fisheries also represent a coveted resource for global food supply. Fishing represents 90 percent and 40 percent of Greenland’s and Iceland’s exports, respectively, and industrial fishing is booming as warming ocean environments globally drive northern migration of fish species toward cooler waters, and melting ice opens access to new fisheries. The vast fishing potential in unclaimed Arctic waters has attracted interest from China, which consumes seafood at twice the average global per capita rate. Fears that overfishing in the Arctic Ocean would accelerate climate change and endanger food supplies for local and Indigenous populations prompted an international agreement banning commercial fishing for sixteen years. The agreement—reached in 2017 among nine nations (Russia, Canada, the U.S., Norway, Denmark, Iceland, China, Japan, and South Korea) and the EU—covers the entire Arctic Ocean. However, lack of policing and strong financial incentives have enabled rampant illegal fishing, costing nations an estimated $15.5 billion annually. As global food insecurity intensifies, demand for, and competition over, these coveted resources is set to increase.
Arctic Governance and Positioning of Power Players
Overlapping organizational mandates, treaties, and conventions complicate Arctic governance. The patchwork nature of Arctic governance is not effectively designed to constrain great power competition, and China’s entrance into the Arctic—as well as the U.S.’s increased focus on the region—are putting pressure on this framework. In the absence of a more coherent and collaborative governance structure, national interests prevail, with outside forces leveraging bilateral relationships to achieve their aims and strengthen their footholds in the region. The current governance framework has increased cooperation among Arctic states on issues such as climate change, Indigenous rights, and scientific research. However, it is ill-equipped to resolve economic disputes between the U.S. and China, or a potential military escalation between the U.S. and Russia.
Key Takeaways
The Issue
A fragmented Arctic governance framework, the Trump administration’s strategic prioritization to counter Russian and Chinese influence in the Arctic, and increasing tensions among the U.S., China, and Russia could further disrupt commercial investments. While a patchwork governance framework of international standards, laws, and treaties has proven effective at resolving small-scale Arctic disputes to date, it is ill-equipped to mitigate a major escalation or confrontation between great powers.
The Reaction
China cemented its status as an Arctic Observer state on the Arctic Council in 2013 and has continued to expand both its political and economic influence in the region ever since. In May of 2019, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo openly condemned Chinese and Russian Arctic activities along the Northern Sea Route at an Arctic Council meeting, citing competing territorial claims. The U.S.’s increasingly hostile relationships with China and Russia are challenging Arctic governance structures and diverting focus from cooperation on climate change and research.
What’s at Stake
Future access to Arctic resources, shipping routes, and territorial claims. National governments and companies that establish their positions in the Arctic now are likely to influence the reorientation of trade and balance of power in the region. However, competing strategic interests and visions for development in the region could imperil future collaborative governance, which would risk necessary cooperation on trade and development in the region.
- GRAPHIC 4: Arctic Territorial Boundaries & Disputed Areas
- GRAPHIC 5: National Economic Interests and Geopolitical Positions
Established in 1996, the Arctic Council is the main international body for regional cooperation in the region and, to date, has served as an effective government mechanism for promoting coordination and cooperation across Arctic states and Observers. Consisting of eight permanent member states and thirteen Observer states, the Council is the primary governance body through which disputes over territorial claims, environmental standards, and relations with Indigenous communities take place. It provides a forum for dialogue and cooperation and has brought Arctic nations together to sign on to numerous international agreements, such as the Agreement on Enhancing International Arctic Scientific Cooperation, signed in 2017.
However, the Arctic Council is only one of many regional governance structures—including the Barents Euro-Arctic Council, the Nordic Council, and the Baltic Sea Council—and international treaties governing the Arctic. While the current governance structure has proved adept at navigating existing legal, economic, and scientific disputes in the Arctic, it is coming under increasing pressure as states outside of the Arctic’s geographic boundaries seek greater commercial and political influence. The growing list of Arctic Observer states eager to assert themselves in the region—such as China, India, and Japan—and exogenous events impacting great power competition are putting pressure on the existing governance structure that it may be ill-equipped to handle.
The 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) is the international legal framework governing offshore activities in the Arctic Ocean. Critical to resource control and management, UNCLOS establishes exclusive economic zones (EEZs) up to 200 miles offshore for each littoral Arctic nation and sets rules for extending continental shelf rights up to 350 miles offshore. Under the convention, each nation is granted control over all living and non-living resources within its EEZ, and the 1.1 million square miles of Arctic Ocean beyond any nations’ EEZs are considered outside of national control. Among the Arctic states, the U.S. is the only member that has not officially ratified UNCLOS, so it is excluded from submitting territorial claims of its continental shelf to the U.N. While UNCLOS establishes control over the majority of Arctic resources, disputes persist over control of key shipping routes—sovereignty over both the Northern Sea Route and the Northwest Passage is contested—and competition for resources such as fisheries and critical minerals is exceedingly difficult to regulate.
China’s presence, in particular, could upset the current governance framework and delicate balance of power. Having joined the Arctic Council as an Observer in 2013, China does not have Arctic territory or historical treaties with the other Arctic states. Nevertheless, its multibillion-dollar investments across all five of the littoral Arctic states and its admittance to the Arctic Council as an Observer state are cementing its increasingly powerful presence in the region. Expanding interests from other non-Arctic states, as well as geopolitical developments outside of the region, are reshaping Arctic relations, with the potential to further disrupt commercial cooperation there. To help explain these evolving dynamics, the key economic interests, and Arctic policies of each of the Arctic littoral nations, as well as other key nations with Arctic interests, are broken down below.

Country Profiles And Policies
Scroll below for a breakdown of key Arctic players’ economic and geopolitical interests and relative strengths in the region. (Note: China is an Observer to the Arctic Council.)
Russia
The development of the Arctic is central to Russia’s economic and geopolitical fate. Russia has the most Arctic territory and coastline, population, and natural resource reserves, and it plans to invest $231 billion in Arctic oil and gas development. Russia is heavily invested in oil and gas exploration and production and mineral extraction and is actively carving out shipping routes and laying digital infrastructure for submarine Internet connectivity. Continued Russian investment across these sectors is critical to the economic development of Russia and of the region as a whole.
Oil and gas exports have enabled strong commercial and coercive ties with Europe for over fifty years. While more recently establishing itself as key natural gas supplier to Asia in 2018, Russia is increasingly attracting investment from China, Japan, and South Korea. For these partnerships to thrive, Russia needs to further develop its existing Arctic infrastructure to access additional natural gas reserves, 95 percent of which are still untapped. Russia is also the critical actor in developing the Northern Sea Route (NSR) for trade and submarine Internet connectivity through undersea fiberoptic cables, activities that are attracting investment from both European and Asian countries. Successful development of the NSR would potentially make Russia critical to global trade and communications between Asia and Europe, strengthening Russia’s commercial ties and political leverage on both continents.
Russia’s resource exports to Europe and China and the country’s role pioneering development of the Northern Sea Route make it the most commercially connected and important Arctic nation. Given its heavy dependence on the Arctic for its own future power supply—not to mention its status as a global supplier, Russia has the most to gain or lose from Arctic economic development. The centrality of Russia’s role in the Arctic makes its contentious relationships with the U.S. and Europe a key point of Arctic tensions. Russia’s annexation Crimea in 2014 and the subsequent U.S. sanctions on Russia’s energy, financial, and defense sectors forced ExxonMobil out of Russia’s Arctic in 2018. Russia’s military buildup in the Arctic and its assertion of sovereign control of the Northern Sea Route continue to fuel U.S. backlash. However, Russia’s centrality to Arctic development for other Arctic nations notably limits U.S. leverage and is unlikely to deter continued international investment in Russia’s Arctic development projects.
United States
A deepening of U.S. engagement in the Arctic began in 2009, under the Obama administration, which focused on climate change as the primary U.S. security challenge in the Arctic. The administration’s climate-focused efforts culminated in National Security Presidential Directive 66, focused on environmental preservation, scientific research, and international collaboration. The U.S. has held considerable economic clout in the region as well, with the state of Alaska accounting for 10.8 percent of the gross regional product produced in the entirety of the Arctic—the second largest economy in the region. However, its economic power is waning, as the low price of oil and the shale revolution continue to take their tolls.
U.S. commercial and strategic interests also extend to critical minerals located in the Arctic. In September of 2020, President Trump released an executive order calling for the U.S. to end its reliance on foreign supply chains of critical minerals. To do that, the U.S. would need to rebuild its domestic processing capability to efficiently exploit and process most critical mineral reserves. Rebuilding these processing capabilities will make Arctic critical minerals deposits significantly more important to the U.S.
Under the Trump administration, however, focus has shifted to Russian and Chinese deterrence in the region, as outlined in the Pentagon’s June 2019 Department of Defense Arctic Strategy report to Congress. President Trump’s June 2020 Memorandum on Safeguarding U.S. Interests in the Arctic called for a review of Arctic icebreaking capabilities and an upgrade on the country’s currently diminished fleet of polar icebreakers by 2029. Three new icebreakers are now being commissioned; once completed, they will compliment two existing icebreakers (which are over forty years old and not suitable for most Arctic missions). These investments, however, will not generate near-term returns, as developing these ships will take years and billions of dollars, and American capabilities will still pale in comparison to Russia’s fleet of thirty-eight, leaving the U.S. far behind Russia in its ability to navigate Arctic waters for scientific, commercial, or military aims.
Due to its relative underinvestment in the region, the U.S. is unlikely to be able to compete economically with either Russia or China in the region. Relative underinvestment in economic development and environmental efforts is diminishing U.S. soft power in the region, making the U.S.’s efforts to curb Russian and Chinese development of the Arctic difficult to enforce. Nevertheless, the U.S. has had some limited success subverting Chinese investment in Greenland and has effectively raised alarms to some other European nations, such as Norway, that are also concerned with the extent of Russian and Chinese presence in the Arctic.
Canada
Canada’s Arctic is home to over 100,000 people, and territory 40 percent of the country’s landmass is located above the Arctic Circle. Arctic economic development is a key domestic policy issue in Canada, while the international focus has been on cooperation. While Canada continually emphasizes cooperation, its economic ties to China, scientific cooperation with Russia, and territorial disputes with the U.S. and Greenland are all sources of international tension. Canada has welcomed extensive Chinese investment, most notably the “Plan Nord,” an $80 billion, twenty-five-year development plan in Quebec. Chinese companies also maintain a presence in mineral extraction and shipping along the Northwest Passage. Canada claims sovereignty over this shipping route, while the U.S. maintains that it is in international waters. This dispute mirrors the territorial debate between Russia and the U.S. over the Northern Sea Route, with Canada sharing Russia’s legal perspective on the Northern Sea Route, positioning itself in opposition to the U.S. in both instances. Additionally, Canada has a scientific partnership with Russia in the Arctic and has not demonstrated similar levels of concern as the U.S. over Russian and Chinese Arctic activities.
Denmark (Greenland)
Greenland’s small population of just 56,025, reliance on Denmark for two-thirds of its budget, and lack of military power make it one of the weaker players in the Arctic. However, Greenland’s abundant mineral resources and its need for outside investment are placing it at the center of Arctic debates. Greenland has abundant mineral and energy resource reserves, but it has been unable to develop them economically. Oil exploration has yielded few results, and fisheries remain essential for Greenland’s economy, accounting for over 90 percent of exports. Greenland has turned to tourism and foreign investment in mining to drive its economy. In 2012, China’s minister of land and resources made an initial prospecting visit, and since then Greenland has welcomed Chinese investment in mining and infrastructure development, and China has maintained a strong presence in Greenland since 2016. Seeking to limit Chinese influence in the region, the U.S. and the Danish government successfully blocked Chinese development of three airports in 2019 and the purchase of an abandoned naval base in 2016. Of strategic military importance to the U.S., Greenland is the location of the U.S.’s Northern-most military base, and Chinese presence in Greenland is emerging as a major point of concern for U.S. security forces in the region. In 2019, President Donald Trump suggested that the U.S. purchase Greenland outright. Greenland’s abundant mineral resources, including rare earths, and its history as a U.S. military outpost in the Arctic make it a potential arena for continued confrontation between the U.S. and China in the Arctic.
Iceland
Iceland’s borders place it geographically outside of the Arctic Circle, denying it territorial rights in the Arctic Ocean under United Nations Convention for the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). Still, the country is heavily reliant on fishing in the Arctic Ocean, which accounts for 27 percent of GDP. As the chair of the Arctic Council since 2019, Iceland has made preserving the ocean environment and gaining territorial rights in the Arctic Ocean top international policy priorities. Iceland’s economy was one of the hardest hit during the 2008 financial crisis, and the lack of offshore oil development has slowed its recovery. To boost its economy, Iceland has turned to exporting geothermal and hydroelectric energy and developing a domestic tourism industry, which grew to account for 7 percent of GDP in 2018. Additionally, Iceland has opened economic ties to China, signing a bilateral energy accord in 2012 and a free trade agreement the following year. Since 2012, Iceland has welcomed $1.2 billion in Chinese investment, accounting for 6 percent of Iceland’s GDP from 2012 to 2017. Accompanying China’s investments, Iceland has also lent China access to scientific facilities, geothermal energy expertise, and telecommunications infrastructure. China’s growing presence, combined with recent Russian aggression toward Iceland—including two Russian bombers entering NATO airspace near Iceland twice—led to visits from both U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and U.S. Vice President Mike Pence in 2020. While Iceland is deepening economic ties with China, its diplomatic relationship with Russia is tense, having deteriorated following NATO sanctions over Russia’s annexation of Crimea.
Finland
Finland was the most recent chair of the Arctic Council (prior to Iceland), from 2017 to 2019. During its chairmanship, Finland focused on strengthening ties between the EU and the Arctic Council and pursuing cooperative climate change mitigation strategies. With well-developed infrastructure above the Arctic Circle, including airports, heavy industry in forestry, mining, renewable and bioenergy, and metal industries, Finland represents a strong actor in the region and a desirable economic and strategic partner—with Finland and Russia already closely aligned. Russia is Finland’s third largest trading partner, and its leading shipbuilding industry makes it an attractive partner to work alongside Russia in developing the Northern Sea Route. The two countries are working on developing polar icebreakers and are collaborating on developing shipping ports and submarine Internet cables along the Northern Sea Route. Finland is one of the six EU states that are not NATO members, and its close relationship with Russia and willingness to collaborate with China make it unlikely that Finland would support increasing U.S. efforts to block those countries’ increasingly assertive development in the region.
Norway
Nearly 10 percent of Norway’s population lives above the Arctic circle, the greatest proportion of any Arctic country. Norway has extensive economic interests in the Arctic, which is a key resource base for future economic development. The Arctic contains an estimated 43 percent of Norway’s remaining undiscovered oil and gas resources and provides 33 percent of the country’s mining activity, and 80 percent of total Arctic shipping volume passes through Norway. Arctic tourism has also emerged as an attractive source of revenue, seeing a 206 percent increase from 2006 through 2013. Building on its strong base, Norway is heavily invested in further developing the Arctic, allocating 40 billion NOK (4.4 billion USD) to infrastructure development and 24.5 billion NOK (2.7 billion USD) to business development since 2016.
Norway’s growth and development agenda would be undermined from increased geopolitical tensions in the region, and international cooperation is the country’s primary foreign policy priority in the Arctic. With strong commercial ties to Russia, and being a NATO member state, Norway is effectively positioned to act as a de-escalator between the U.S. and Russia. It has pursued multilateral cooperation with Russia through international and regional organizations such as the UN and the Arctic Council, and it has collaborated with the U.S. and other NATO allies to deter increased Russian military presence in the Arctic.
China
China became an Arctic Observer state on the Arctic Council in 2013 and has since dramatically increased its Arctic activities. From 2012 to 2017, China invested over $435 billion across all five of the Arctic littoral states, and it has conducted extensive scientific and commercial voyages, including multiple navigations of the Northern Sea Route by the state-owned China Ocean Shipping Company. Further cementing its presence in the Arctic, China has also forged research partnerships with Iceland, Greenland, Norway, and Russia. From 2017 to 2019, Chinese officials began development on a polar research base and a satellite ground station for climate change research in Greenland, a research station in Iceland to study space weather, a research station on Norway’s Svalbard Island, and a research center in Russia to forecast ice conditions along the Northern Sea Route. This influx of Chinese investment has provided a critical resource for Arctic economic development and furthering scientific understanding of the region. However, it has also been a major cause of tension in the region, as the U.S. has repeatedly singled out Chinese Arctic activity as a security concern.
A strategic region within China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), officials have deemed it the “Polar Silk Road,” with sweeping BRI plans aiming to connect Asia with Africa and Europe via land and maritime networks in order to re-route global trade and stimulate economic growth. China plans to invest an estimated $1 trillion to $8 trillion into the BRI initiative overall, primarily on ports, roads, railways, airports, power plants and telecommunications networks. So far, its investments in the Arctic have reflected these priorities. For example, China is collaborating with Finland to develop the Talsinki tunnel, an undersea rail tunnel between Helsinki and Tallinn meant to eventually route trade from Europe to China through the Northern Sea Route. Additionally, China has invested extensively in mining and energy, reflecting efforts to strengthen and diversify its resource supply chains. In this respect, the Arctic is likely to become increasingly important to China, as the region contains the energy resources to fuel China’s economy, the critical minerals key to its advanced technology ambitions, and abundant seafood supplies to meet domestic demand. China’s deepening commercial interests and partnerships in the Arctic, are set to further inflame tensions with the U.S. and make the regional a focal point for intensifying geopolitical competition.
Emerging Arctic Geopolitical Competition and Cooperation
Competition for Arctic resources, particularly critical minerals and natural gas, is shaping geopolitics in the region, but direct military confrontation over resources has not yet materialized. Economic tensions in the Arctic today are largely manifesting from China’s investments in the region, Russia’s commercial partnerships and militarization, and territorial disputes. China invested $450 billion in the Arctic from 2012 through 2017, across all of the Arctic nations. Chinese investment is driving development of the Northern Sea Route, for both shipping and submarine Internet connectivity. In addition to creating stronger commercial ties between China and Russia, this development would strengthen Russia’s claim of sovereign control over the NSR, which the U.S. still disputes. The Arctic’s geographic position among the U.S., Russia, and Europe makes it a de facto location for competition to play out among these powers, and Russia’s and China’s investment ambitions are making the region a focal point of competition between great powers.
Key Takeaways
The Issue
China’s extensive investments across the region are providing funding for the development of the Northern Sea Route and submarine Internet cables connecting Europe and Asia via Russia. The extent of Chinese FDI—and its critical role in Russian development of the Arctic and the Northern Sea Route—is the major point of friction driving U.S. intervention in the region today.
The Reaction
The U.S. is leading the pushback against China’s increased Arctic presence and its economic partnerships with Russia. Having openly condemned China’s and Russia’s Arctic activities, the U.S. has pressured countries into canceling Chinese-funded commercial projects and has cited Chinese activity as a key catalyst for its renewed focus on the Arctic.
What’s at Stake
Chinese investments provide billions of dollars in funding for Arctic economic development, with several nations courting investors to shore up local economies. Chinese investment is critical to developing Arctic infrastructure and access resources, and U.S. efforts to deter China’s regional presence will be highly divisive among Arctic nations.
- GRAPHIC 6: Chinese Investment In The Arctic
- GRAPHIC 7: Potential Shipping Routes
As the nation with the most Arctic territory, population, and investments, Russia represents the dominant player in the Arctic today, but its stature is being propped up by nearly $200 billion in Chinese investment—the most China has invested in any country. Development of the NSR is key to Russia’s control of the Arctic in the future and will potentially re-route trade from Europe to China through Russian waters. However, the U.S. has disputed Russian control of the Northern Sea Route for over fifty years, with that battle intensifying over Chinese involvement. Additionally, Chinese investments in the development of submarine Internet cable along the NSR (built in part by Huawei Marine), which would provide a high-speed Internet connection between Europe and China—are ratcheting up tensions given the U.S.’s prolonged and deepening fight to keep Chinese telecommunications technology, and specifically Huawei, out of Europe. The development of submarine Internet cables between Europe and China is likely to incite further pushback from the U.S., which has already worked with the Danish government to push Chinese investments in airport infrastructure out of Greenland and cancelled domestic Chinese investments in natural gas development. The scope of China’s Arctic investments and its impacts on future development of the Northern Sea Route for shipping and Internet connectivity are broken down below.
China Is Heavily Invested Across the Arctic, Driving Development and Controversy
Amid the global economic downturn and plummeting commodity prices, many Arctic nations, particularly Russia, Finland, Greenland, and Iceland, depend increasingly on foreign direct investment (FDI). To date, China is by far the largest foreign investor in the region—investing $1.4 trillion into the Arctic from 2005 through 2017 across a wide range of sectors. Chinese investments include billions of dollars in energy extraction in northern Russia, prospecting for minerals in Greenland, and a sealed strategic joint venture between Huawei Marine and the Finnish company Cinia Oy to build a submarine communication cable along the Northern Sea Route linking Europe and Asia. From 2012 through 2017, China invested in over 281 projects in Russia, with an average investment of $691.7 million per project. While other countries have made major investments in the Arctic—France and Japan are both co-investors in Russia’s LNG pipeline —China is by far the most active, with 884 projects. Recent Chinese investments, in particular, have been spurring heavy international pushback from the U.S. and Europe, given concern that Chinese investment in the Arctic is strengthening ties to Russia.
In 2019, planned Chinese investment in three Greenland airports was cancelled after the U.S. pressured the Danish government to intervene and cancel the contracts citing security concerns. Until 2017, the U.S. (primarily Alaska) was the second-largest Arctic investment market for China. Since then, that relationship is increasingly under strain due to mounting U.S.-China tensions over trade, intellectual property rights, and territorial claims. In response to the Trump Administration’s 2018 tariffs on Chinese goods, China placed retaliatory tariffs on Pacific Northwest seafood—Alaska’s largest export to China—endangering future economic relations. In July of 2019, Alaskan governor Mike Dunleavy scrapped a $43 billion natural gas pipeline deal between a private U.S. company and three state-owned Chinese companies signed in 2017. In his 2019 speech to the Arctic Council, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo specifically called increasing Chinese presence and strengthening Russian and Chinese ties as threats to U.S. and Arctic security.
Notable Private Sector and SOE Activity:
- Chinese company General Nice Group purchased a Greenland iron ore mine in 2015.
- Huawei Marine invested in building a submarine Internet cable along the Northern Sea Route in 2016.
- The China National Petroleum Corporation and China Silk Road Fund invested in the Yamal LNG project developed by Russia’s Novatek in 2016.
However, given the precarity of their economies, particularly in the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis, both Greenland and Iceland welcomed Chinese investment. From 2012 through 2017, Chinese FDI in Greenland and Iceland accounted for 11.6 percent and 5.7 percent of overall GDP, respectively. In 2012 Greenland passed the Large-Scale Projects Act, which grants foreign workers rights in Greenland and creates a pathway for more Chinese workers to immigrate to Greenland. Investment in the Arctic is also a critical source of employment for Greenland, where unemployment rates reached as high as 10.3 percent in 2014. However, weak or unenforceable labor regulations in the Arctic mean that there is no oversight to ensure that companies extracting resources from the Arctic adhere to environmental standards. The increase of Chinese and Russian companies in the region, with no mechanisms to hold foreign companies responsible for environmental disasters, has raised concerns among a number of environmental organizations. Nevertheless, Chinese investment is critical to the continued development of the region. Private investment in extractive industries has not provided the expected economic boost for most Arctic nations, and China’s willingness to provide state-backed investment capital is key for commercial development across Greenland, Iceland, Finland, and Russia.

With Help from China, the Northern Sea Route Will Potentially Re-Route Future Trade from the Suez Canal
Access to Arctic shipping routes represents one of the most contentious ongoing debates in the Arctic. Newly accessible shipping routes will pass through multiple national borders, more directly connecting Europe, Russia, and China. The two major Arctic shipping routes that are now navigable during portions of the summer months include the Northern Sea Route (NSR) and the Northwest Passage. The Northern Sea Route connects Asia and Europe, extending from Rotterdam to Shanghai. If the NSR can be successfully developed, it would re-route shipping trade currently moving through the Suez Canal. A strategic priority for China and Russa, it’s completion would save China billions of dollars in shipping costs and provide Russia with revenues through transit fees. In January of 2020, Russian president Vladimir Putin laid out an ambitious decree that aims to triple shipping through the Arctic from 31.5 million tons of cargo in 2019 to 90 million by 2030. However, achieving this goal relies on continued investment from China, which has already set aside $9.5 billion to invest in Russian Arctic development.
Notable Private Sector and SOE Activity:
- Maersk conducted an Arctic voyage along the Northern Sea Route in 2018 and is actively exploring opportunities for future shipping activities. COSCO has completed roughly thirty voyages throughout the Arctic.
- Other major shipping companies CMA CGM, Hapag-Loyd, and MSC have backed away from use of Arctic shipping routes, citing environmental concerns.
Controversy and competition swirl around the NSR due Russia’s territorial claims over the route; it exercises complete control over the NSR, and any ship passing through must obtain clearance from Russian authorities. According to the UNCLOS, the entire NSR lies within Russia’s EEZ. The U.S., which is not a signatory on the UNCLOS, claims that the NSR is in international waters, meaning freedom of navigation applies and Russia does not have legal jurisdiction over trade along the route. Despite the U.S.’s ongoing challenge to Russian control, the U.S. has not been able effectively mount a challenge or bring or nations to its side.
While currently transiting only a fraction of the amount of cargo of the Suez Canal—in 2019, only 31 million tons of good were shipped along the NSR, compared to 1.2 billion tons shipped along the Suez Canal—the potential volume enabled by climate change could transform global trade. Development of the NSR is estimated to attract $200 billion in investment over the next fifteen years, primarily for icebreaking vessels and ports. As the volume of cargo transiting through the NSR increases, it is likely to attract more investment from nations beyond China. Finland is a leading ship manufacturer and is already working with Russia to develop polar icebreakers, and India is exploring the possibility of importing Russian natural gas through the Northern Sea Route. The Northwest Passage, which connects New York to Shanghai by cutting through the Arctic along the Canadian and Alaskan coasts, is not yet as developed as the Northern Sea Route. In 2019, only twenty-seven ships passed through the Northwest Passage, down from thirty-one in 2017. However, if the Northern Sea Route can create significant economic gains as sea ice melts in the coming years, development along the Northwest Passage will also increase. As that development materializes, the Canadian sovereignty of the Northwest Passage—which the U.S. also disputes—will become a more central issue.

Potential Shipping Routes
Submarine Internet Cables Will Digitally Connect Europe and Asia While Providing Monitoring Capabilities to Russia and China
Notable Private Sector and SOE Activity:
- Cinia Oy and Huawei Marine are building submarine Internet cables along the NSR.
- Quintillion is invested in building submarine cables to connect London and Tokyo.
- MegaFon is the Russian telecom company that is working with Internet providers to deliver services from the submarine cable along the NSR.
- Datakortet is a Norwegian data storage company that is working to use the NSR submarine Internet connection to expand data center operations.
In addition to shipping routes, melting sea ice is enabling companies to lay submarine Internet cable beneath the Arctic Ocean. Submarine Internet cables increase connectivity speeds and enable real-time monitoring of Internet traffic and underwater activity using acoustic sensors. In 2018, the Russian Armed Forces began construction on a submarine Internet cable along portions of the Northern Sea Route that facilitates monitoring of the Arctic waters between China and Norway. An additional submarine Internet cable along the NSR began construction in 2016, as a joint venture between the Finnish company Cinia Oy and the Chinese company Huawei Marine. Once completed, the submarine cable between Finland and China will allow Chinese monitoring along the NSR seabed, similar to China’s existing monitoring capabilities in the South China Sea. The ability to monitor the seas using Internet cables is a key point of contention with the U.S., since Russian submarine cables create a distinct military advantage along the NSR, which the U.S. considers international waters.
The ongoing confrontation over global control of the Internet’s hard infrastructure playing out over 5G will no doubt turn to Russia’s and China’s development of undersea Internet cables in the Arctic and globally. While the U.S. is raising alarms over China’s control of global 5G networks, China is intensifying its focus on undersea cables—which make up 95 percent of all data and voice traffic between continents. China’s Huawei, under its Marine Networks division, is constructing or improving nearly 100 submarine cables around the world. Despite potential U.S. pushback, the demand for submarine Internet development along the NSR is high—with Finland eager to develop its growing data center industry, and Japan also invested in the Arctic Connect project, hoping to access increased Internet speeds. The U.S. has already demonstrated a willingness to take extreme measures to block Huawei’s development of 5G networks internationally, blocking companies around the world from using American-made machinery and software to design or produce semiconductors for Huawei, pressuring governments to ban its Huawei hardware, and banning U.S. government agencies and contractors from operating on Chinese telecoms. The same pattern will potentially play out with submarine Internet cables. If more European and Asian countries adopt submarine Internet cables linked to China, that will imperil their future commercial and diplomatic relationships with the U.S. and potentially force them to choose between commercial ties to the U.S. or China.
Planned Submarine Internet Cable Lines
- Arctic Fiber (2014): A $1.5 billion submarine cable linking Tokyo and London via Alaska and Canada. Submarine cables would pass through the Atlantic Ocean, the Canadian coast, the Alaskan coast, and the Bering Strait.
- Arctic Connect (2016): A joint venture between Finnish company Cinia Oy and Huawei Marine to build a submarine communication cable along the Northern Sea Route linking Europe and Asia. The submarine Internet cables would connect Finland, Norway, Russia, China, Japan, and South Korea.
- Russian Military Cable (2018): Russian construction of a submarine cable for military communications, which will stretch 12,700 kilometers on the seafloor across the Arctic Ocean to the border of Norway.
Looking Ahead: Commercial Competition Setting the Stage for Regional Defense Buildup
Melting sea ice is enabling increased access to the Arctic’s abundant natural resources, with tensions growing over the control of Arctic waters and major commercial implications—particularly for shipping routes and future digital connectivity. Additionally, the Arctic’s geographic position among Europe, the U.S., and Russia makes it susceptible to geopolitical confrontations among nations, sparked by events outside of the region. While the Arctic has been a region of international cooperation and peace in recent decades, increased U.S. and Chinese involvement in the region could upset this balance. The U.S. is likely to continue pushing back against China’s increased presence and against Russia’s assertion of control over the NSR and its military buildup. While European nations have been split on accepting Chinese investment, with economic and geopolitical considerations differing across countries, to date they have largely not opposed Russian economic development in the region. However, Russia’s increasing military presence has pushed Europe to begin collaborating with NATO allies to counter military activity in the Arctic. Russia’s military buildup presents one of the greater challenges facing the region, and militarization of the Arctic is likely to increase tensions in the region more quickly than competition over resources. In Part II of FP Analytics’ Arctic Competition Power Map series, we will explore Russia’s increasing militarization of the Arctic, China’s role, and the Arctic’s governance framework’s ability to manage competition among great powers.

This thawing, which could release vast amounts of greenhouse gases, is already changing the Arctic landscape by causing landslides, draining lakes, and altering vegetation.","Canadian scientist Philip Marsh and I were flying along the coast of the Beaufort Sea, where the frozen tundra had recently opened up into a crater the size of a football stadium. Located along the shoreline of an unnamed lake, the so-called thaw slump was gray, muddy, and barren, in sharp contrast to the brilliant russet and gold of the surrounding autumn tundra. These retrogressive thaw slumps, or landslides — formed as warming temperatures rapidly thaw permafrost — are increasing across the Arctic, including the kilometer-long, 100-meter-deep Batagaika Crater in the Yana River Basin of Siberia.
The tundra of the western Canadian Arctic has long been carpeted in cranberries, blueberries, cloudberries, shrubs, sedges, and lichen that have provided abundant food for grizzly bears, caribou, and other animals. Now, however, as permafrost thaws and slumping expands, parts of that landscape are being transformed into nothing but mud, silt, and peat, blowing off massive amounts of climate-warming carbon that have been stored in the permafrost for millennia. If this had happened in an urban area, it would have resulted in dozens of buildings being swallowed up. If it had happened along a pipeline right-of-way, it might have resulted in an environmental disaster.
As the Arctic warms faster than any region on Earth, public attention has largely been focused on the rapid disappearance of Arctic sea ice. But major changes are also taking place on land, and one of the most striking is the thawing of vast swaths of permafrost that have underlain these polar regions for millennia. That thaw is taking a toll in complex ways that are not clearly understood, and scientists such as Marsh are now intensifying efforts to grasp how these changes will play out this century and beyond.
Some 2.5 million square miles of permafrost — 40 percent of the world’s total — could disappear by the end of the century.
What we do know is that if the Arctic continues to warm as quickly as climatologists are predicting, an estimated 2.5 million square miles of permafrost — 40 percent of the world’s total — could disappear by the end of the century, with enormous consequences. The most alarming is expected to be the release of huge stores of greenhouse gases, including methane, carbon dioxide, and nitrous oxide that have remained locked in the permafrost for ages. Pathogens will also be released.
But less well appreciated are the sweeping landscape changes that will alter tundra ecosystems, making it increasingly difficult for subsistence indigenous people, such as the Inuit, and Arctic animals to find food. The disintegration of subterranean ice that glues together the peat, clay, rocks, sand, and other inorganic minerals is now triggering landslides and slumping at alarming rates, resulting in stream flows changing, lakes suddenly draining, seashores collapsing, and water chemistry being altered in ways that could be deleterious to both humans and wildlife.
“We’re seeing slumping along shorelines that can drain most of the water in a lake in just days and even hours,” says Marsh, a former Canadian government scientist who is now a professor of hydrology at Wilfrid Laurier University in Ontario. “It’s not surprising when you consider that as much as 80 percent of the ground here consists of frozen water. When that ice melts, the frozen ground literally falls apart.” As a result, says Marsh, indigenous communities, the resource industry, and the government need to better understand how a warming climate is impacting water resources and permafrost ecosystems.”
As the helicopter pilot circled Marsh’s research site searching for a dry spot to land, I could see the Husky Lakes in the distance. This is a unique treeline/tundra transitional zone where grizzly bears have been known to kill or mate with polar bears and where sea-going belugas swim into brackish inland lakes.
From the helicopter, the research camp below looked like a stick man. Narrow wooden boardwalks connect weather stations, snow, and rain gauges, and instruments that determine how much carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, and methane are being absorbed by tundra plants and how much of these gases is being emitted into the atmosphere. The boardwalks were laid down so that the scientists’ boots won’t disturb the thawing peat and permafrost or skew the recordings. Solar panels and a back-up generator kept everything powered, including an electrified fence designed to keep out both grizzly and polar bears.
Marsh, who has conducted field work in the Arctic for more than four decades, established this research station in Trail Valley Creek in 1991. Not only is it situated in the most rapidly warming region on Earth, but it is also the site of a new Arctic highway, hundreds of now-dormant exploratory oil and gas drilling sites, and some of the most important bird nesting territory in the Arctic. Like all permafrost scientists, he and his colleagues have worked in arduous conditions, fighting off hordes of biting flies and mosquitoes in the summer, and measuring snowpack and ground temperatures in bitter winter cold.
Marsh’s research in the Canadian Arctic has already led him to conclude that climate warming will result in hydrological changes this century that will dry up 15,000 of the 45,000 lakes in the Mackenzie River Delta, one of the largest deltas in the world. He also expects to see more of what Antoni Lewkowicz, a geographer and permafrost expert at the University of Ottawa, is seeing father north on Banks Island in the High Arctic of Canada. Lewkowicz recently reported a 60-fold increase in slumping along 288 lakes that he has monitored with satellite imagery from 1984 to 2015.
An estimated 1,400 gigatons of carbon are frozen in Arctic permafrost, making it one of the world’s largest carbon sinks.
Slumping can occur with sudden catastrophic force. In one notable case that was captured on time-lapse photography in 2015 by Steve Kokelj, a permafrost expert with the Northwest Territories Geological Survey, a rapidly thawing cliff bordering the shores of a tundra lake collapsed into the Peel River watershed in the Northwest Territories. The waterfall that was created drained approximately 800,000 gallons of water from that upland lake in just two hours. Heavy metals in the permafrost, such as mercury, were flushed downstream along with silt and peat, tainting the river system for miles downstream.
Permafrost occurs in areas where the temperature of the ground remains below the freezing mark for two years or more. About a quarter of the Northern Hemisphere’s landscape fits this definition. Most of the world’s permafrost is found in northern Russia, Canada, Alaska, Iceland, and Scandinavia. Much of it underlies peat ecosystems. But like peat, permafrost is also found in the Rocky Mountains of Canada and Alaska, the Alps, the Himalayas, the high-altitude Patagonia region of South America, and the high country of New Zealand.
The rapid thawing of permafrost has enormous implications for climate change. There are an estimated 1,400 gigatons of carbon frozen in permafrost, making the Arctic one of the largest carbon sinks in the world. That’s about four times more than humans have emitted since the Industrial Revolution, and nearly twice as much as is currently contained in the atmosphere. According to a recent report, a 3.6-degrees Fahrenheit ( 2 degrees Celsius) increase in temperature — expected by the end of the century — will result in a loss of about 40 percent of the world’s permafrost by 2100.
Greenhouse gases on the tundra are released in two ways. As permafrost thaws, once-dormant microorganisms break down organic matter, allowing methane and carbon to be released in the atmosphere. Thawing can also open pathways for methane to rise up from reservoirs deep in the earth.
The permafrost thawing that is leading to the release of greenhouse gases is intensifying across the Arctic. Much of the permafrost degradation that has occurred on Canada’s Banks Island took place after some of the warmest years on record, according to Lewkowicz. In 1984, the island had 60 active slumps. By 2013, there were 4,000. Lewkowicz expects that the island may see as many as 30,000 new active slumps in the coming years.
This thawing will have a profound impact on the flow and chemistry of lakes and streams, as well as those parts of the Arctic Ocean into which rivers drain. Lewkowicz’s satellite data, for example, shows that the color of many of the lakes on Banks Island has changed from blue to turquoise, indicating that the once-clear water has become filled with sediments.
Scientists suspect that some of the slumping may be giving new life to pathogens capable of killing muskoxen, caribou, and nesting birds as warmer temperatures nudge the pathogens out of their dormant state. Massive die-offs of muskoxen on Banks and Victoria islands in Canada, as well as reindeer in Siberia, appear to be related to once-dormant pathogens that are coming back to life.
The date when snow melts is key to determining the rate at which the permafrost thaws.
Scientists are also finding that hundreds of sumps excavated by the oil and gas industry in the 1970s and 1980s are now thawing. Toxic petroleum waste that was supposed to be permanently contained in 200 frozen pits in the Mackenzie Delta, for example, is migrating into nearby freshwater ecosystems.
At Trail Valley Creek, Carolina Voigt, a post-doctoral geography researcher, and Oliver Sonnentag, a hydrologist at the University of Montreal, are using manual and automated sensors to measure how climate change affects greenhouse gas activity on the tundra. Evan Wilcox, a geography PhD candidate at Wilfrid Laurier University, has made important discoveries about the role that the rapid expansion of shrubs in the Arctic — the result of rising temperatures — is playing in the thawing of permafrost. All across the warming Arctic, shrubs are expanding into tundra where grasses, sedges, and lichens once prevailed. Not only are the taller shrubs shading out the smaller plants below, they are also changing the hydrology of the ecosystem.
“We’re finding that the date when snow melts is the key to determining the rate at which the active-layer permafrost thaws,” says Wilcox. “The snow in tundra areas where you have shrubs such as dwarf birch tends to melt a week earlier than it does in areas where there are no shrubs. This results in more permafrost thawing. As the shrubs expand into the tundra, we’re likely to see an acceleration of thawing.”
Wilcox bores steel probes — as many as 3,000 one recent summer — into the ground to determine the depths of ground thaw. Arduous as that is, Niels Weiss, a postdoctoral fellow working with Marsh, has a much tougher time hammering into the solid ice to get the sample he needs to determine how much and what kind of organic material is contained in the permafrost. Weiss has conducted permafrost research in Siberia, Scandinavia, and Canada, and he and others have found that carbon storage and the ways gas is released from these ecosystems depend on a variety of factors such as soil composition, groundwater flow, and whether trees, shrubs, or grasses are predominant. What’s clear, he says, is that even in the coldest places in the Arctic, permafrost is thawing at accelerating rates.
Although much remains to be discovered about the impacts of thawing permafrost in the region, Marsh says one thing is becoming increasingly clear: In the coming decades, the tundra landscape will look much different than it does now.
That change was evident as we bushwhacked through 8-foot-high willows en route to retrieve a water gauge swept away during the spring flood. Thirty years ago, lichen and sedges dominated this landscape. Today, willows and shrubs are proliferating across the tundra. Abundant caribou once fed on the lichen, their numbers on the Tuktoyaktuk Peninsula hitting 3,000 in 2006. Now, only half that number remain.

With the new strategy, the Government presents its plans for navigating Denmark through a changing world order.","The Strategy does not propose a change of course, but instead comprises a series of concrete initiatives and focus areas that align with the guiding principles and aims of the Government’s previous Foreign and Security Policy Strategy.
Minister for Foreign Affairs, Anders Samuelsen, said:
”The world today is a better place to live than ever before. But at the same time the world is far more unpredictable. Global power relations are shifting, and the rules-based international cooperation that has been defining the global development is under pressure. These developments place greatdemands for Denmark's foreign and security policy. We must engage in the world, fight for our values and actively pursue our interests. Only this way can we ensure that Denmark will continue to be among the world’s most free, safe and prosperous countries in the future”.
The Strategy outlines the most important areas for Denmark’s Foreign and Security Policy: Rules-based international order; Security; Europe – a strong, streamlined, and effective EU; Refugees, migration and development; Economic Diplomacy, strategic partnerships and the new digital world order; The Arctic.
Minister of Defence, Claus Hjort Frederiksen, said:
”The threats against Denmark are very complex and are in my perspective the most unpredictable since the end of the Cold War. This is based not least on the aggressive behavior of Russia, massive cyberattacks, instability in the Middle East and North Africa and the sustained terrorist threat against Europe and Denmark. It is therefore of the utmost importance that the US commitment in Europe is maintained through NATO, which remains the cornerstone of Danish security policy. We must also strengthen the European security architecture and be at the forefront of the international cooperation on cyber security.”
Minister for Development Cooperation, Ulla Tørnæs, said:
”We have succeeded in reducing the refugee and migration pressure. This means that we can prioritize more resources for efforts in the countries of transit and origin. In the coming years, we will increase our focus on long-term efforts to fight the root causes for irregular migration and contribute to a sustainable development. This also requires that we strengthen the rights of girls and women, which are key in meeting the Sustainable Development Goals”.
The Strategy will be discussed in the Danish Parliament Thursday 22 November.

Shivering Arctic dwellers may need housing rethink,"Housing intended for warmer climates doesn't work well in the Arctic - but more energy efficient, healthier options are available, an expert says.","Arctic housing specialist Jack Hébert likes to paraphrase a saying from the Inupiaq, a Native Alaskan group living north of the Arctic Circle.
""Before the white man came, we lived in the ground and we buried our dead in the air,"" atop the tundra, Hébert said. ""After the white man came, we buried our dead in the ground, we live in the air and we've been cold ever since.""
Over the last three generations, the Inupiaq have transitioned from traditional homes dug into the earth for insulation to freestanding houses that struggle to withstand the extreme climate of far northern latitudes.
Their experience is emblematic of how designs imported from more southern regions have failed to meet Arctic housing needs, said Hébert, founder of the Cold Climate Housing Research Center in Alaska.
""No one has ever asked rural Alaskans what they were going to live in,"" Hébert told the Thomson Reuters Foundation at the Arctic Encounter Symposium in Seattle.
In the mid-20th century, national, state and provincial governments financed large-scale social and subsidised housing in Alaska, northern Canada and Arctic Russia, Hébert said, often with disastrous consequences for health risks and household energy costs.
""Elders and children in Alaska have the highest incidence of upper respiratory distress of any population in the United States and it's directly attributed to poor indoor air quality - mold, moisture, inadequate ventilation,"" Hébert said.
In 2009, his center assessed homes in Quinhagak, nearly 400 miles (700 km) southwest of Anchorage, and found 30 percent were at risk of catastrophic structural failure and suffering from severe mold due to poor construction that trapped moisture inside the walls.
""The houses themselves were so rotten you could push a Number 2 pencil right through the wall and you couldn't mount a toilet on the floor,"" he said.
Quinhagak's experience is emblematic of the Arctic region, he said.
""Canada and Russia are pitiful - the same horror stories are right across the border,"" he said.
Housing conditions are better in the Nordic countries, however, which have more robust social housing programmes and whose Arctic territories have milder climates, he said.
More cost, less warmth
Inadequate insulation is also a recurring problem, leading to excessively high heating costs and helping drive climate change.
In January 2018, the most recent month for which data is available, heating oil averaged about more than $4 per gallon in Alaska, with higher prices in off-road areas like the Arctic, according to a state fuel price survey.
Fuel in North Dakota - which has some of the coldest winters in the continental United States - cost just over $2 per gallon by comparison.
Hébert's center has designed housing prototypes that are warmer and can reduce average heating oil consumption by as much as 90 percent.
About 14,600 homes in Alaska are extremely energy inefficient, or 5.7 percent of total Alaska homes, according to the 2018 Alaska Housing Needs Assessment.
""The largest untapped source of energy savings is retrofitting homes for better insulation,"" former Alaska Lieutenant Governor Mead Treadwell told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.
""People are always reluctant to add things to a building code that add cost and can deny people housing,"" he said. Requiring insulation ""has not been a priority for state government - and it should be"", he said.
Have you read?
The Cold Climate Housing Research Center's headquarters, in the Alaskan city of Fairbanks, is the farthest north building in the world to meet top U.S. construction standards for energy efficient buildings that are also healthy to live in.
It has done that through measures such as drawing in the earth's warmth with a ground source heat pump, catching and storing the sun's energy and installing hundreds of sensors to monitor energy efficiency.
What Arctic dwellers need in terms of housing is similar to what they need from a good winter parka, he said.
""You need good insulation that's tight - you don't want a broken zipper - and (it's) the same thing for your house: you want a complete thermal envelope. That means no cold spots,"" said Hébert, 70.
He grew up in a cedar house in southeast Alaska and lived for several years in a traditional sod house north of the Arctic Circle.
""I experienced firsthand the indigenous technologies and how perfectly they were adapted to the environment,"" he said.
""People don't necessarily want to go back to living in sod houses,"" he said. ""But those principles of sustainable shelter can be incorporated with 21st century technologies to make much more comfortable homes.""",,Gregory Scruggs,Sustainable Development,World Economic Forum|WEF|Davos|Klaus Schwab|globalization|globalization4.0|globalization4|globalization four|what does globalization mean?,2019-04-30,World Economic Forum

- Development of human resources
Content
Policy Highlights:
- The importance of the Arctic for India is constantly growing, primarily due to the challenges associated with climate change and global warming.
- India regards the Arctic as the common heritage of mankind.
- The draft policy seeks to establish a roadmap for Sustainable Engagement in the Arctic Region.
- It also lists a wide range of activities that India seeks to pursue in the Arctic including economic, diplomatic and scientific activities.
- The draft policy document further reflects ambitious planning, which is one of the key highlights of India’s recent global engagements.
- One aspect of the draft Arctic Policy centers around climate change and it highlights the intricate link between conditions in the Arctic and the monsoon and Himalayan systems.
Through the draft Arctic Policy India seeks to achieve the following goals:
- To play a constructive role in the Arctic by leveraging its vast scientific pool and expertise in Himalayan and Polar research.
- to contribute in ensuring that as the Arctic becomes more accessible, the harnessing of its resources is done sustainably and in consonance with best practices formulated by bodies such as the Arctic Council.
India’s Arctic policy will rest on five pillars:
- Science and research
- Economic and human development cooperation
- Transportation and connectivity
- Governance and international cooperation
- National capacity building
India and the Arctic:
- The Arctic is commonly understood to refer to the region above the Arctic Circle, north of latitude 66° 34’ N, which includes the Arctic Ocean with the North Pole at its centre.
- Much of this Ocean falls within the jurisdiction of five Arctic littoral states—Canada, Denmark (Greenland), Norway, Russia and the USA (Alaska).
- Three other Arctic nations – Finland, Sweden and Iceland – along with the five littorals form the Arctic Council.
- The Arctic is home to almost four million inhabitants, of which approximately one-tenth are considered as indigenous people.
- India’s interests in the Arctic region are scientific, environmental, commercial as well as strategic.
- India became the observer of Arctic Council in 2013 and its membership as an observer was renewed in 2018 for another five years.
- The National Centre for Polar and Ocean Research (NCPOR), Ministry of Earth Sciences, Government of India, is the nodal agency for India’s Polar research programme, which includes Arctic studies.
- India’s Ministry of External Affairs provides the external interface to the Arctic Council.
Significance For India
- The Arctic influences atmospheric, oceanographic and biogeochemical cycles of the earth’s ecosystem.
- Moreover, the Arctic is vulnerable to climate change and global warming. The effects are manifested by the loss of sea ice, ice caps, and warming of the ocean and atmosphere.
- It will lead to lowering of salinity levels, rising temperature differential between land and oceans in the tropical regions, drying of subtropical areas and increase in precipitation at higher latitudes. India is particularly impacted due to the likely effect of these changes
Changes in the Arctic and global ecosystem induced by melting Arctic ice, can be highly disruptive for India in the following ways:
- Changes to Monsoon patterns caused by the Arctic changes adversely impact Indian agriculture, food security and wellbeing of the rural sector.
- Melting ice sheets and sea level rise can accelerate coastal erosion.
- The thawing of permafrost soil could potentially release viruses and bacteria that have lain dormant for thousands of years, thereby increasing the propensity of pandemics. The Covid-19 pandemic has shown us the scale of disruption that can be caused by pathogens.
Thus, the Arctic is important for India’s national development, economic security, water security and sustainability.
Role of science:
- India’s engagement with the Arctic began in February 1920, when it signed the Svalbard Treaty in Paris.
- In 2007, India’s first scientific expedition to the Arctic was launched with the objective of initiating a series of baseline measurements in biological sciences, ocean and atmospheric sciences and glaciology.
- In 2008, the Indian research station ‘Himadri’ was established in the international Arctic research base at Ny-Ålesund in Spitsbergen, Svalbard, Norway.
- IndArc, the country’s first multi-sensor moored observatory was deployed in Kongsfjorden in 2014.
- In 2016, India’s northernmost atmospheric laboratory was established at Gruvebadet. The laboratory is equipped with several instruments that can study clouds, precipitation, long-range pollutants, and other background atmospheric parameters.
The major objectives of the Indian Research in Arctic Region are as follows:
- To study the hypothesized tele-connections between the Arctic climate and the Indian monsoon by analyzing the sediment and ice core records from the Arctic glaciers and the Arctic Ocean.
- To characterize sea ice in the Arctic using satellite data to estimate the effect of global warming in the northern polar region.
- To conduct research on the dynamics and mass budget of Arctic glaciers focusing on the effect of glaciers on sea-level change.
- To carry out a comprehensive assessment of the flora and fauna of the Arctic and their response to anthropogenic activities. In addition, it is proposed to undertake a comparative study of the life forms from both the Polar Regions
Global governance and international cooperation
Arctic is important from a geopolitical point of view because:
- The Arctic region is very rich in minerals, and oil and gas.
- The Arctic Council does not prohibit the commercial exploitation of resources in the Arctic. It only seeks to ensure that it is done in a sustainable manner
- With some parts of the Arctic melting due to global warming, the region also opens up the possibility of new shipping routes that can reduce existing distances.
For Governance and International Cooperation, India’s draft policy aims to :
- Pursue international cooperation and partnerships with all stakeholders in the region;
- Uphold international law and in particular UNCLOS, including the rights and freedoms contained therein, and support common heritage of humankind in the deep seabed area in the Arctic;
- Actively participate in international climate change and environmental treaty frameworks relating to the Arctic;
- Enhance participation in organizations relevant to the region of which India is a member such as the International Maritime Organisation and the International Hydrographic Organisation;
- Participate in economic activities in the region in accordance with the UN Sustainable Development Goals 2030 framework.
The Arctic Council
- The Arctic Council is the leading intergovernmental forum promoting cooperation, coordination and interaction among the Arctic States, Arctic indigenous communities and other Arctic inhabitants on common Arctic issues.
- The Council has the eight circumpolar countries as member states
- It is mandated to protect the Arctic environment and promote the economies and social and cultural well-being of the indigenous people whose organizations are permanent participants in the council.
- The Arctic Economic Council (AEC) was created by the Arctic Council during the 2013-2015 Canadian chairmanship. It is an independent organization that facilitates Arctic business-to-business activities and responsible economic development through the sharing of best practices.
UNCLOS
- Being an ocean , the Arctic Ocean is also governed by the UNCLOS – the United Nations Convention on the Law Of the Sea.
- Among these are the arctic coastal states of Canada, Denmark, Norway and the Russian Federation.
- However, USA has not ratified this convention.
- This complicates the demarcation of maritime zones and the determination of extended continental shelf claims
- This has raised several conflicts over how Arctic shipping and resource management activities will be governed in the future.
Chinese Interests
- China—which has linked its interest in the Arctic area with the Maritime Silk route.
- In January 2018, China declared itself a “Near Arctic State’’ and put out a white paper.
- According to US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo China has invested nearly $90 billion in the Arctic between 2012-2017.
- In its policy, China states that the Arctic has “global implications and international impacts.”
- Thus geopolitics of the Arctic have gone beyond its original inter-Arctic States or regional nature.
Development of human resources
As new opportunities open up in the Arctic, India needs to enhance its human resource capabilities. Skilled workforce would be needed in sectors ranging from science and exploration, to seafaring and economic cooperation.
To achieve these goals the policy has made the following provisions:
- Expand capability, capacity and awareness for Arctic-related scientific research by strengthening the National Centre for Polar and Ocean Research (NCPOR), involving academic and scientific institutions in India and identifying nodal institutes;
- Promote domestic scientific research capacities by expanding earth sciences, biological sciences, geosciences, climate change and space related programmes, dove-tailed with Arctic imperatives in Indian Universities;
- Strengthen indigenous research capacity in global climate modelling with special focus on South Asia, especially impact of Arctic warming on the variability of the monsoon;
- Put in place Arctic related programmes for mineral/oil and gas exploration in petroleum research institutes;
- Encourage tourism and hospitality sectors in building specialised capacities and awareness to engage with Arctic enterprises;
- Expand student programmes on the blue-bio economy of the Arctic through a gamut of institutions working on living and non-living marine resources;
- Strengthen nautical training institutions for training seafarers in Polar/ice navigation and build region specific hydrography capacity and skills necessary to undertake Arctic transits;
- Expand India’s trained manpower in the services sector backed by English-speaking skills in maritime insurance, chartering, arbitration and brokerage;
- Build a wide-ranging institutional base on Arctic maritime, legal, environmental and governance issues.

The Arctic Circle, fraught with melting polar ice caps, is becoming a key stage for global competition and potentially for the escalation of a great power conflict in the near future.
As the Arctic's treacherous polar ice caps melt away, nations have begun to engage in a modern gold rush over the region’s unclaimed territory, natural resources, and strategic position. As a consequence of the rapidly disappearing polar ice caps, there has been an increase in unclaimed ocean and land territory, beyond any nation’s control, that countries are attempting to gain jurisdiction over for purposes, such as resource extraction and trade routes. Beyond economic motivations, nations such as the United States, Russia, and China are competing in the region to project military supremacy and seek more power. The Arctic also sits at a critical position between North America and Eurasia, making it a powerful strategic position from which to project military strength. As the liberal international order is increasingly under threat by great power conflict (a scenario in which the already-contentious relationship among the United States, Russia and China could devolve into war), the Arctic Circle faces a crossroads: will the underlying boiling tensions explode to the point of larger global conflict or can diplomatic means be the key to ensuring peace in the region?
A 2018 National Aeronautics and Space Administration report estimated that the Arctic has lost 21,000 square miles of sea ice per year in the last five decades, opening up more territory on the narrowing strip of land for controlling and cultivating. Control over Arctic territory has given nations the ability to settle it, extract resources, and establish military outposts, making legal rights and claims over such territory incredibly valuable. Most legal matters concerning the region are determined by The Arctic Council: an intergovernmental organization that encourages cooperation in the region. Its key nation members are those that border the Arctic: the United States of America, Russia, Canada, Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, and Iceland. Currently, Russia and Canada have claimed the most land in the region, which is demonstrative of the scope of their influence in the region. Beyond the eight neighboring countries, there are also thirteen observer countries affiliated with the Arctic Council, such as China, Germany, and India. The difference in roles between member nations and observer countries, in many cases, can be seen in their stated reasons for being in the region. For example, the United States and Russia have previously justified their territorial expansion due to their proximity to the region, while China is more explicit about resources motivating their involvement in the region. The combination of a finite, yet growing amount of claimable territory as well as the perception of a zero-sum game have set these nations on a collision course for potential conflict. Consequently, the Arctic Council works to resolve disputes by publishing agreements and focusing on sustainability and environmental protection of the Arctic. The melting polar ice caps and ensuing territorial debates have set the stage for the magnification of the Arctic Council’s global role.
The competition over land claims is driven in part by nations' desire for the region’s natural resources, specifically natural gas, which provides almost a quarter of all global energy usage. Most natural gas supplies around the world have already been explored and exploited, but the Arctic presents a vast untapped reserve over which nations are vying for control. A US Geological Survey estimates that the region has 1,699 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and various other fuels, equal to the entirety of Russia’s oil reserves and three times as much as those of the United States.
The United States, Russia, and China are the primary nations competing for control of the Arctic’s resources. Parties to the United Nations Convention for the Law of the Sea are entitled to resources that are within 370 kilometers of their shorelines, but most of the natural gas resources in the Arctic are beyond these legal borders. This distance creates a scramble to control these resources that goes beyond the influence of international organizations, stimulating further intra-nation conflict. As such, even nations that are far away from the Arctic are beginning to involve themselves in its affairs, such as China, whose interests lie in the resources that the Arctic holds rather than the land itself. China has few domestic energy resources with most of its energy consumption reliant on foreign imports from the Middle East, the United States, and Russia, which drives its ambition to tap Arctic natural gas to secure energy independence. China’s Arctic ambitions lay beyond merely energy however, as they have recently expanded their plans to take advantage of the nation’s resources in the state of legal confusion.
The Chinese Government has dubbed their involvement in the Arctic region as the “Polar Silk Road,” which is an allusion to the trade routes that they intend on pursuing following the acquisition of natural resources. China’s legal claim to the region differs from many other nations due to their lack of a land border to the Arctic, complicating their efforts. Chinese companies such as Shenghe Resources, China Nuclear Hua Sheng Mining, China National Petroleum Corp., and China National Offshore Oil Corporation have attempted to expand their mining projects in the region, but have found bureaucratic barriers and political opposition coming from the Danish, who control Greenland. Furthermore, China is outnumbered by its primary competitors, the United States and Russia, who have been operating in the region for far longer and have more experience in resource extraction. China’s one icebreaker, known as “The Xuelong 2” or “The Snow Dragon 2”, pales in comparison to the United States’ five icebreakers and Russia’s 51 icebreakers. The recent construction of “The Xuelong 2” has motivated the United States to ramp up production of icebreakers, including a plan to launch three more by 2029. The icebreakers are representative of the larger cat-and-mouse game that is emerging by the three nations, in which they attempt to pre-empt the other two countries and respond in kind to an opposing nation’s expansion in the region.
Outside of great power conflict, the rush for resources, especially fossil fuels such as natural gas, causes serious environmental impacts. As countries expand their drilling in the Arctic Circle, further erosion and harm to local species could occur as a result. Arctic drilling could exacerbate the damage that has already been done in the region with potential oil spills, which could devastate wildlife populations. In spite of these environmental consequences, the nations embroiled in the Arctic Circle conflict appear poised to further develop their drilling programs primarily for economic reasons. Economic benefits would resonate domestically in each country due to job creation, lower costs of energy, and energy independence, and would also extend to more favorable and profitable international trade. The conflict in the Arctic Circle mirrors many of the dynamics present in the South China Sea conflict, in which a competition over access to strategic positions and trade routes has expanded into a more overt conflict between great powers who see each other’s actions as actively hostile. Similarly, the non-binding nature of Arctic Council resolutions and the lack of enforcement powers limit the body’s ability to regulate the conflict at a time when peaceful negotiation and cooperation might be needed the most. The legal protections for the Arctic and its resources are no longer as effective in preventing competition.
The need to preserve these geopolitical and economic interests have motivated nations to bring a military presence to the region. Russia’s Red Arctic objective has propelled them to maintain its military presence through its numerous airbases and border outposts. Russia has recently flaunted its military might in the region through its August 2019 Ocean Shield Exercise, demonstrating its capability to conduct military operations in the region and to deter other nations from interfering. Russia’s military motivations in the region stem from its need to project strength, its perceived defensive needs, and its protection of economic interests in the region. Meanwhile, the United States currently has one airbase, the Thule Air Base, located in northern Greenland. In 2017, the United States invested US$40 million in improving the Thule Air Base due to Russia’s escalation of military presence in the region. The Air Base’s location is uniquely strategic given that it sits at almost the exact midway point of Washington DC and Moscow. The implications of the Thule Air Base for conflicts outside of the Arctic can not be understated as it could detect any incoming missile from Russia, North Korea, or China. The US-Russia dynamic in the Arctic Circle region is reminiscent of the Cold War, and while the two militaries have not come into direct conflict, their constant parade of military exercises and increasing military investment in the region set the collision course for a conflict that might erupt, especially as the territory is rapidly decreasing in land mass
The growing military competition over the Arctic has the potential to draw in even more nations. A 2019 US Department of Defense report speculated that China might be exploring the logistical possibilities of establishing a military presence in the region. The addition of a third global power’s military in the region could be the catalyst to a direct confrontation between the competing nations, but this potential larger battle could provide an opportunity for the Arctic Council to step up as a peacemaker in the region. The lack of international legal protections in the region creates a need for cooperation and diplomacy that could prevent escalating tensions. Resources and land are inherently finite, which makes the regional expansion a zero-sum game. The presence of armies heightens the already contentious dynamic in the region by allowing for the possibility of miscalculation. Although the risk of intentional military escalation might be apparent, the possibility of accidental conflict escalation in the region also remains a looming threat. Even though the tantalizing opportunity of acquiring more land and resources might not be enough incentive to lure global leaders into a devastating conflict that would cost many human lives, but simply having the military in the region might be enough to start a conflict that ends up spilling over into other regions such as the aforementioned South China Sea and the Middle East. This potential military conflict makes the Arctic Council’s role as a mediator crucial for preventing military conflict and for attempting to bring peace to the region.
As polar ice caps continue to melt, more unclaimed territory will become available for drilling and trade routes and, as a result, the potential to acquire more resources would increase as well. The real possibility that nations will become economically and militarily invested in the region means that media members and the general public ought to pay more attention to its geopolitics. Even as the conflicts between the United States and Russia and the United States and China gain more attention in the media, the Arctic Circle deserves to be among the forefront of those discussions. The actions and rhetoric of the United States, China, and Russia have and will continue to influence each other in the region. Consequently, expanding involvement in the region can be viewed by the other nations as a threat to their regional interests and has, in the past, pitted these countries against each other. Diplomatic means to resolve the conflict, such as the Arctic Council, exist, but questions remain about their ability to resolve the conflict and create agreements that are actually adhered to. The 2020s decade could prove to be the pivotal moment for the Arctic Council’s influence in the region and provide faith in cooperative international organizations. The implications of a successful Arctic Council resolution could increase the credibility, in the minds of skeptics, of other organizations which have recently had doubt cast upon them such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the United Nations. Conversely, a negative ending to the regional conflict could extend beyond the region into a larger war in multiple regions. Although the Arctic Circle is characterized by its geographical position at the top of the planet, right now, it appears to be the center of the world.

As the Arctic warms, vegetation is responding, and satellite measures indicate widespread greening at high latitudes. This ‘greening of the Arctic’ is among the world’s most important large-scale ecological responses to global climate change. However, a consensus is emerging that the underlying causes and future dynamics of so-called Arctic greening and browning trends are more complex, variable and inherently scale-dependent than previously thought. Here we summarize the complexities of observing and interpreting high-latitude greening to identify priorities for future research. Incorporating satellite and proximal remote sensing with in-situ data, while accounting for uncertainties and scale issues, will advance the study of past, present and future Arctic vegetation change.

The U.S. government has articulated its fundamental interest in the Arctic for more than 40 years in a series of government strategies: beginning with President Nixon’s 1971 National Security Decision Memorandum (NSDM-144), to Ronald Reagan’s 1983 National Security Decision Directive (NSDD-90), to President George W. Bush’s National Security Presidential Directive 66 and Homeland Security Presidential Directive 25, signed in 2009, and the 2016 Report to Congress from the Department of Defense on Strategy to Protect United States National Security Interests in the Arctic Region.1 Each document established broad guidelines for U.S. policy in the region that aligned with the geostrategic realities at the time.2 Today, there are three major drivers that are shaping the Arctic: Geopolitical drivers of great power competition with the largest Arctic coastal state Russia and a self-proclaimed “near Arctic state,” China; Environmental drivers, which are simultaneously transforming the Arctic maritime and terrestrial space at rates that confound scientists while fueling the development of flexible governance structures; and, Economic drivers that are highly correlated with global commodity prices. U.S. policy toward the Arctic is driven by these factors as well as Alaska’s important domestic economic role providing vital energy, mineral, and fishery resources. The Alaskan North Slope contains some of the country’s largest oils fields and natural gas fields; the 2016 value of its mineral industry was $2.83 billion3; and fisherman landed $5.4 billion of fish and shellfish in 2017.4 Alaska’s economic activity has been subdued for the past several years due to lower global energy prices. The state must respond to increased coastal erosion necessitating village relocation, permafrost thaw, and fresh water scarcity which is dramatically altering traditional livelihoods. The challenge for an overarching U.S. Arctic policy is that it must address all of these cross-cutting issues simultaneously: protect the homeland, pursue environmental adaptation and resilience, and address global economic and security dynamics while engaging in anticipatory policymaking. U.S. government strategies and documents for the Arctic are largely descriptive in nature, and they have yet to alter resource allocations (with the exception of recent congressional funding for one heavy-icebreaker, which will be predominantly used in Antarctica) or establish new organizational structures that can more efficiently address these cross-cutting issues. They also do not offer a clear set of priorities. The Stagnation of U.S. Arctic Policy under the Obama and Trump Administrations Despite the relentless pace of the three major drivers, U.S. policy toward the Arctic has remained largely stagnant over the past decade with a continued emphasis on science and international collaboration. In other words, the United States “makes do” by “making it work.” This has been particularly true for the U.S. Coast Guard, the lead U.S. agency with responsibilities for protecting the American Arctic and securing maritime waterways. Despite over a decade of studies and assessments, the U.S. Coast Guard continues to rely on outdated capabilities and thinly resourced budgets, which equates to a seasonal U.S. Coast Guard presence (July-October) in the American Arctic. Should an incident occur in the American Arctic, it is hoped that it happens during this season and preferably near a pre-positioned U.S. maritime asset. Years of underinvestment now leaves the United States ill-prepared as other nations prioritize the region as one of future geostrategic value. In other words, the United States “makes do” by “making it work.” One of the most significant moments in the Arctic’s geopolitical development occurred in 2013 when China was invited to become a permanent observer to the Arctic Council. This decision, combined with theemergence of Chinese President Xi Jinping as China’s leader and the implementation of the Belt and Road Initiative, gave China greater impetus to be more economically, diplomatically, and scientifically visible in the Arctic. This occurred at the same moment when the Obama administration was preparing in earnest for its chairmanship of the Arctic Council (2015-2017). Since 2009, the Obama administration largely viewed the Arctic region as an alarming and persuasive example of the need to elevate climate change as a national security imperative. The U.S. administration created new administration positions (e.g., a U.S. special representative to the Arctic Region and an executive director of the Arctic Executive Steering Committee) largely to manage its Arctic Council Chairmanship to give the Arctic issue greater public visibility and engage more closely with the state of Alaska. The Obama administration also increased the size of federally protected lands and waters in the American Arctic to minimize development that could adversely impact its environmental protection efforts. Much of this work built up to August 2015 when President Obama became the first president to visit the Alaskan Arctic in part to chair the Global Leadership in the Arctic Cooperation, Innovation, Engagement, and Resilience (GLACIER) conference, which brought together 20 foreign ministers, including those from Arctic nations and Arctic Council observer nations, to call for immediate international action to tackle climate change. China and Russia did not sign the GLACIER declaration. President Obama’s three-day Arctic visit formed the basis of the U.S. priorities during its chairmanship of the Arctic Council (2015-2017): improving economic and living conditions in Arctic communities; Arctic Ocean safety, security, and stewardship; and addressing the impacts of climate change.5 But as a reminder of the growing geopolitical dynamics in the region, President Obama’s Alaskan visit occurred simultaneously with a large Sino-Russian naval exercise off the coast of Vladivostok, Russia in which Alaskans were greeted by 5 Chinese naval vessels off the Aleutian Islands.6 The Trump administration concluded the U.S. Arctic Council chairmanship without significant change, but the administration began to disassemble the Obama administration’s Arctic-specific administrative structures, emphasized economic development, and dismissed climate impacts in the region. The U.S. budget dedicated to Arctic science and research has remained largely intact due to bipartisan congressional support, and U.S. secretaries of state continue to attend Arctic Council ministerial meetings. The Trump administration has re-opened onshore and offshore areas in the American Arctic for development such as the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) to oil and gas drilling with expedited environmental review although judicial review has slowed this process. New offshore leases in the Chukchi Sea have been made available, and the administration is working to promote oil exploration beneath ANWR’s coastal plain along the Beaufort Sea in what is thought to be the largest untapped onshore oil deposit in North America. In 2017, the governor of Alaska signed a Joint Development Agreement with China worth an estimated $43 billion to develop Alaskan liquified natural gas (LNG) for export to China. Despite this greater desire for and receptivity to Arctic economic development, U.S. Arctic infrastructure remains very limited and will inhibit economic development. The closest U.S. deep-water port is Dutch Harbor in the southern Bering Sea, which is over 800 miles from the Bering Strait. The lack of icebreaking capabilities is one of the most glaring of U.S. capability gaps, but the U.S. Coast Guard recently selected a firm to construct a polar security cutter which should be in service by 2024.7 As transits through the Bering Strait have more than doubled over the past decade,8 there is also an urgent need for greater communications assets and maritime domain awareness capabilities, particularly through the narrow Bering Strait. One consistent success for U.S. policy in the Arctic is the question of governance. The United States has quietly and effectively engaged with the Russian government to introduce to the International Maritime Organization (IMO) a Vessel Traffic Management System for the Bering Strait, which took effect on December 1, 2018. It is the first internationally recognized ship routing measure approved by the IMO for polar waters.9 The United States also worked diligently at the IMO to secure a mandatory Polar Code, which came into force in January 2017. Finally, the United States, working closely with the other four coastal states, negotiated a preemptive fisheries moratorium for the high seas of the Central Arctic Ocean and brought together four other fishing nations (China, Korea, Japan, and Iceland) and the European Union to join that agreement (the CAOFA 5+5 Agreement). Geopolitical Competition in the Arctic – the U.S. View The greatest failing of U.S. policy has been its reluctance to understand the strategic implications of great power competition in the Arctic. While the United States believes the Arctic will remain of limited strategic value and that its current minimalist posture is sufficient, its two near-peer competitors, Russia and China, have taken dramatically different and long-term views of the region and have expanded their military and economic footprints. The United States has now begun to question whether its current posture is sufficient, but there is no government-wide consensus on w…","The Implications of U.S. Policy Stagnation toward the Arctic Region

Introduction: Broader Background for U.S. Arctic Policy
Today, there are three major drivers that are shaping the Arctic:
- Geopolitical drivers of great power competition with the largest Arctic coastal state Russia and a self-proclaimed “near Arctic state,” China;
- Environmental drivers, which are simultaneously transforming the Arctic maritime and terrestrial space at rates that confound scientists while fueling the development of flexible governance structures; and,
- Economic drivers that are highly correlated with global commodity prices.
The challenge for an overarching U.S. Arctic policy is that it must address all of these cross-cutting issues simultaneously: protect the homeland, pursue environmental adaptation and resilience, and address global economic and security dynamics while engaging in anticipatory policymaking. U.S. government strategies and documents for the Arctic are largely descriptive in nature, and they have yet to alter resource allocations (with the exception of recent congressional funding for one heavy-icebreaker, which will be predominantly used in Antarctica) or establish new organizational structures that can more efficiently address these cross-cutting issues. They also do not offer a clear set of priorities.

Since 2009, the Obama administration largely viewed the Arctic region as an alarming and persuasive example of the need to elevate climate change as a national security imperative. The U.S. administration created new administration positions (e.g., a U.S. special representative to the Arctic Region and an executive director of the Arctic Executive Steering Committee) largely to manage its Arctic Council Chairmanship to give the Arctic issue greater public visibility and engage more closely with the state of Alaska. The Obama administration also increased the size of federally protected lands and waters in the American Arctic to minimize development that could adversely impact its environmental protection efforts. Much of this work built up to August 2015 when President Obama became the first president to visit the Alaskan Arctic in part to chair the Global Leadership in the Arctic Cooperation, Innovation, Engagement, and Resilience (GLACIER) conference, which brought together 20 foreign ministers, including those from Arctic nations and Arctic Council observer nations, to call for immediate international action to tackle climate change. China and Russia did not sign the GLACIER declaration.
President Obama’s three-day Arctic visit formed the basis of the U.S. priorities during its chairmanship of the Arctic Council (2015-2017): improving economic and living conditions in Arctic communities; Arctic Ocean safety, security, and stewardship; and addressing the impacts of climate change.5 But as a reminder of the growing geopolitical dynamics in the region, President Obama’s Alaskan visit occurred simultaneously with a large Sino-Russian naval exercise off the coast of Vladivostok, Russia in which Alaskans were greeted by 5 Chinese naval vessels off the Aleutian Islands.6
The Trump administration concluded the U.S. Arctic Council chairmanship without significant change, but the administration began to disassemble the Obama administration’s Arctic-specific administrative structures, emphasized economic development, and dismissed climate impacts in the region. The U.S. budget dedicated to Arctic science and research has remained largely intact due to bipartisan congressional support, and U.S. secretaries of state continue to attend Arctic Council ministerial meetings. The Trump administration has re-opened onshore and offshore areas in the American Arctic for development such as the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) to oil and gas drilling with expedited environmental review although judicial review has slowed this process. New offshore leases in the Chukchi Sea have been made available, and the administration is working to promote oil exploration beneath ANWR’s coastal plain along the Beaufort Sea in what is thought to be the largest untapped onshore oil deposit in North America. In 2017, the governor of Alaska signed a Joint Development Agreement with China worth an estimated $43 billion to develop Alaskan liquified natural gas (LNG) for export to China.
Despite this greater desire for and receptivity to Arctic economic development, U.S. Arctic infrastructure remains very limited and will inhibit economic development. The closest U.S. deep-water port is Dutch Harbor in the southern Bering Sea, which is over 800 miles from the Bering Strait. The lack of icebreaking capabilities is one of the most glaring of U.S. capability gaps, but the U.S. Coast Guard recently selected a firm to construct a polar security cutter which should be in service by 2024.7 As transits through the Bering Strait have more than doubled over the past decade,8 there is also an urgent need for greater communications assets and maritime domain awareness capabilities, particularly through the narrow Bering Strait.
One consistent success for U.S. policy in the Arctic is the question of governance. The United States has quietly and effectively engaged with the Russian government to introduce to the International Maritime Organization (IMO) a Vessel Traffic Management System for the Bering Strait, which took effect on December 1, 2018. It is the first internationally recognized ship routing measure approved by the IMO for polar waters.9 The United States also worked diligently at the IMO to secure a mandatory Polar Code, which came into force in January 2017. Finally, the United States, working closely with the other four coastal states, negotiated a preemptive fisheries moratorium for the high seas of the Central Arctic Ocean and brought together four other fishing nations (China, Korea, Japan, and Iceland) and the European Union to join that agreement (the CAOFA 5+5 Agreement).
Geopolitical Competition in the Arctic – the U.S. View
The greatest failing of U.S. policy has been its reluctance to understand the strategic implications of great power competition in the Arctic. While the United States believes the Arctic will remain of limited strategic value and that its current minimalist posture is sufficient, its two near-peer competitors, Russia and China, have taken dramatically different and long-term views of the region and have expanded their military and economic footprints. The United States has now begun to question whether its current posture is sufficient, but there is no government-wide consensus on what future steps should be taken.
RUSSIA
The last several years have seen a significant uptick in Russian and NATO military activities and large exercises in the Arctic. Both entities have repositioned military forces in the region, approaching levels not seen since the Cold War. In September 2017, Russia conducted its Zapad 2017 military exercise, which involved an estimated 60,000-70,000 troops, approximately 70 aircraft, and 680 pieces of military equipment including 250 tanks and 200 rocket and artillery systems.10 Much of the exercise included Russia’s Northern Fleet, which is based on the Kola Peninsula in the Arctic Ocean, and included simulated missile strikes from sea. In October 2018, NATO responded with its own military exercise centered around Northern Norway—Trident Juncture 2018, its largest since the end of the Cold War. It included around 50,000 participants from NATO and partner countries, 250 aircraft, 65 ships, and up to 10,000 vehicles.11 Nearly 20,000 U.S. troops were involved, and it was the first time in nearly 30 years that a U.S. aircraft carrier and strike group ships crossed the Arctic Circle.12
The greatest failing of U.S. policy has been its reluctance to understand the strategic implications of great power competition in the Arctic.
Much of Russia’s military modernization focuses on its sea-based nuclear deterrent and the introduction of a new hypersonic cruise missile, most of which are also based on the Kola Peninsula. In 2019, Russia announced it would formally withdraw from the Intermediate Nuclear Forces (INF) agreement after the United States announced it was suspending its participation due to repeated Russian treaty violations. But despite these growing tensions, the United States and Russia also work constructively in the Arctic Council, through the Arctic Coast Guard Forum, and bilaterally. The U.S. Coast Guard District 17 and its Russian FSB counterpart work to promote maritime safety and fisheries law enforcement in the Bering Strait along the U.S.-Russian Maritime Boundary Line (MBL) in the Bering Sea, respond to distress calls at sea, and protect the maritime environment.13
In addition to its military footprint, Russia also has ambitious economic plans for the Russian Arctic, which center on LNG production on the Yamal Peninsula and creating a viable international transit route through the Northern Sea Route.
CHINA
With its January 2018 Arctic White Paper and the incorporation of the Arctic into its Belt and Road Initiative, a Chinese “Polar Silk Road” includes the potential construction of airports, railroads, ports, undersea cables as well as the exploitation of the Arctic’s energy and mineral resources. China also opened its first scientific research station in 2004 on the island of Svalbard and has since launched the China-Iceland Arctic Science Observatory (CIAO) in Northern Iceland. Chinese economic and scientific investments as well as Chinese diplomatic presence in a variety of multilateral forum that deals with the Arctic translate into more significant physical presence in the circumpolar Arctic.
Between 2012 and 2017 China invested some $154 million into the Icelandic economy, after the country became the first European nation to sign a free trade agreement with China in 2008.14 Chinese investments center on energy resources including oil and gas shelf sites Dreki and Gammur. In Greenland, officials regularly travel to China to encourage investment in key sectors. In September 2016, Shenghe Resources bought a stake in Greenland Minerals and Energy with an eye on developing rare earth elements as well as uranium and zinc.15 Additionally, four mining sites in Greenland have attracted serious interest from Chinese companies; two of which are likely to come online in the short term.16 Once in operation, they would make Chinese state-owned enterprises (SOEs) the top foreign investors in Greenland’s natural resources.17 Keenly interested in trans-Arctic shipping, China has completed construction of its second icebreaker and has announced plans to develop a nuclear icebreaker.18 For the moment, the focal point of Chinese economic investment is the Yamal LNG project on the eastern coast of the Yamal Peninsula in Russia. Chinese companies own 29.9 percent of the $27 billion project, an “anchor” investment that can translate into future “cluster” infrastructure investments such as port, rail, and telecommunications projects.
Despite these developments and U.S. government strategies describing a return to great power competition, future relations between the United States and China in the Arctic will likely follow a similar trajectory to the U.S. position on Russia’s activities in the Arctic: one of growing concern and suspicion about their ultimate ambitions and projects but a lack of new or adjusted policy direction. In the absence of direction, the same U.S. policies apply: focus on maritime security cooperation, scientific collaboration, and low-level cooperation in the Arctic Council.19
The Future of U.S. Arctic Policy: Watching yet Still Waiting
To date, the United States does not have a meaningful policy response to either Russia’s or China’s increased economic and military ambitions in the region. For now, Washington is acknowledging Russia and China’s growing footprint in the Arctic, but it is allowing both nations to largely shape the region’s future. With the exception of the construction of a polar security cutter, there are no other significant infrastructure initiatives on the horizon. Secretary Pompeo will attend the Arctic Council ministerial in May 2019 in Finland, but the United States may either dilute or delete meaningful mention of climate change from the ministerial’s conclusions. In response to Russian military actions, the U.S. military is placing a greater focus on the region and is increasing its presence in Iceland, Norway, and Alaska. The White House is also examining more closely Chinese presence in the Arctic but again, studying the actions of others is not constructing its own policy.
One hopes that the eventual U.S. policy response to great power competition in the Arctic does not fall into the “too little, too late” category.
For now, Washington is acknowledging Russia and China’s growing footprint in the Arctic, but it is allowing both nations to largely shape the region’s future.

Objectives
The purpose of the new programme, Nordic Partnerships for the Arctic, is to create sustainable and constructive development in the region and for its people. This will be achieved by focusing on four dimensions:
- Planet
- Peoples
- Prosperity
- Partnerships.
Partnerships have traditionally played a major role in the Nordic programmes for co-operation in the Arctic and horizontal partnerships will continue to be a top priority.
One of the keys to the programme is to meet the specific needs of the Arctic. The 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals and 2030 Agenda play a fundamental role in this context.
The new programme will help the Council of Ministers achieve its vision in Together we are stronger of an innovative, visible, outward-looking Nordic Region without borders, and implement its three horizontal strategies for gender equality, sustainable development and children and young people in an Arctic context.
Budget
The budget for the Arctic Co-operation Programme is in two parts.
- One part is based on political priorities and provides the Nordic countries with an opportunity to initiate projects and other initiatives on the basis of political priorities.
- The other part covers open calls for funding applications for projects that meet the programme’s objectives and given criteria.
Funding applications
The Nordic research institute Nordregio is responsible for the administration of the application process. Funding is awarded on the basis proposals from the Council of Ministers and recommendations by the Nordic countries. The national recommendations will be processed by the Arctic Expert Committee (NRKA).",,,,,2019-10-30,Nordic cooperation

""The main finding of the research project is that as a means of livelihood, reindeer husbandry is adaptable to","Can climate adaptation be culturally sustainable in the Arctic?
While ways of reindeer husbandry may be adaptable to the changing climate, intergenerational transmission of Indigenous knowledge can be negatively impacted, according to a Finnish study.
“The main finding of the research project is that as a means of livelihood, reindeer husbandry is adaptable to climate change, but as a cultural way of life, it is highly endangered,” the researchers said.
“The SAAMI project – Adaptation of the Saami people to climate change ” was done by Finland’s University of Oulu.
To do the study, the researchers spoke with 72 Sami people in 13 different reindeer cooperatives in Finland, along with the Sami Parliament in Finland.
Sami communities in Finland started noticing signs of climate change in the 1960s, the study found, but the environmental change has accelerated in their traditional lands over the course of the 2000s. And while Sami communities have been able to adapt to the day-to-day challenges of climate change, there are real concerns about how the changing environment will affect living Sami culture, the researchers heard.
“Adaptation measures influence the reindeer work model and then the work model changes, also some of the traditions disappear while new emerge,” Klemetti Nakkalajarvi, one of the researchers told Eye on the Arctic in an email interview.
“The next generation learns only the adapted traditions, skills and reindeer work model. Some of the informants have said that if adaptation continues and more traditions are lost, is there Sami reindeer herding culture anymore or is it just a livelihood (or profession)? Most of the interviewed herders have raised a serious concern on the future of Saami reindeer culture.”
- Direct: a category that includes any changes observed in things like flora and fauna (74 impacts were identified in the study)
- Indirect: a category that includes ecosystem changes (12 impacts were identified in the study)
- Tertiary: a category that includes permanent changes from climate change to the Sami culture and ways of making a living (16 impacts were identified in the study)
Impacts on reindeer herding
One example is increasingly warm winters often leading to snow melting and then icing over, preventing reindeer from digging down to the lichen they rely on for food.
The study found that Sami reindeer herders had been able to adapt their herding practices in response to this kind of climate change by incorporating technology or alternate feeding methods for their animals when necessary, but that adapting to the cultural fallout from this is much less clear.
“Climate adaptation has resulted for example introduction of supplementary nutrition in Sami reindeer herding,” Nakkalajarvi said. “This has affected the behavior of reindeer, relationship between the reindeer and the herder and pasture cycle.”
“The next generation learns only the reindeer work model that uses supplementary nutrition,” Nakkalajarvi said. “So climate change as such does not interrupt the cultural transmission, but since the culture changes due to adaptation measures, also the cultural tradition, skills and language passed on to one generation to the next change. So traditional knowledge becomes thinner.”
Climate policy needs more Indigenous voices, say researchers
The study found that climate change disproportionately affects the Sami, but that they are underrepresented when it comes to contributing to climate policy, something that needs to change, the researchers said.
“Climate change programs make only general references to the Sami people, and their participation in the preparation of the programs has been limited,” the researchers said.
The study proposes 14 calls to action to facilitate climate adaptation and minimize the impact on living Sami culture, with many of points advocating for more Indigenous involvement in climate policy.
Among other actions, the project proposes that a joint expert body be created to make sure that climate researchers and holders of traditional Sami knowledge are in frequent contact.
“According to our analysis, current Climate Act and national strategies on climate change overlook Sami people,” Nakkalajarvi said.
“We proposed to establish a Sami Climate panel. It would be an independent organ. it’s members would include scientists from different disciplines and Sami traditional knowledge holders. The panel would be responsible for providing data on the effects of climate change and participating in climate policy. Another concrete proposal includes drafting of the Sami climate change adaptation policy.
“Finland is currently renewing its Climate Act. This creates a good possibility for the Sami to propose actions that support Sami needs and aims.”

The United States assumed the two-year rotating chairmanship of the Arctic Council on April 24, 2015. Given the increased strategic importance of the region, the next two years offers the United States an unprecedented opportunity to make significant progress on our Arctic policy objectives, which were first laid out in the National Strategy for the Arctic Region released by the White House in May 2013 and followed by an Implementation Plan [PDF] in January 2014.
The U.S. will be chairing the Arctic Council at a crucial moment when the effects of climate change are bringing a myriad of new environmental, human and economic opportunities and challenges to the Arctic. During the U.S. Chairmanship, the State Department will focus the Arctic work it carries out through the Arctic Council, various international scientific cooperation mechanisms and, in some cases, domestic initiatives led by U.S. states or other U.S. government agencies. The three thematic areas of the U.S. Chairmanship are: improving economic and living conditions in Arctic communities; Arctic Ocean safety, security and stewardship; and addressing the impacts of climate change. The theme of the U.S. Chairmanship of the Arctic Council is “One Arctic: Shared Opportunities, Challenges and Responsibilities,” which recognizes the peaceful and stable nature of the Arctic. The U.S. chairmanship will conclude in spring 2017 with a Ministerial meeting in Alaska, at which point the United States will hand the chairmanship to Finland.
To guide U.S. engagement on the Arctic during this crucial period, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry appointed the former Commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard, Admiral Robert J. Papp, Jr., as the first-ever U.S. Special Representative for the Arctic in July 2014.
The U.S. has developed an ambitious and balanced program for its Arctic Council Chairmanship that focuses on three crucial areas: improving economic and living conditions; Arctic Ocean safety, security and stewardship; and addressing the impacts of climate change.
1. Improving Economic and Living Conditions in Arctic Communities
Remote Arctic communities face a number of threats to the health and well-being of their citizens, including food and water security, safe water, sewer and sanitation, affordable and renewable energy, adequate mental health services, and the need to ensure the continued economic viability of their communities.
Our work in this area will aim to:
- Promote the development of renewable energy technology, such as modular micro-grid systems, to spur public-private partnerships and improve energy affordability;
- Provide a better understanding of freshwater security in the Arctic, including through the creation of a Water Resources Vulnerability Index;
- Coordinate an Arctic-wide telecommunications infrastructure assessment to promote the build-out of commercial infrastructure in the region;
- Support mental wellness, including suicide prevention and resilience;
- Harness the expertise and resources of the Arctic Economic Council to inform the Arctic Council’s work on economic and living conditions;
- Mitigate public health risks and reduce black carbon output in Arctic communities;
- Promote better community sanitation and public health by facilitation collaboration between industry, researchers and public policy experts to increase access to and reduce the operating costs of in-home running water and sewer in remote communities.
2. Arctic Ocean Safety, Security and Stewardship
The acceleration of maritime activity in the Arctic increases risk in an already harsh and challenging environment. U.S. Chairmanship priorities include building upon existing preparedness and response programs; enhancing the ability of Arctic states to execute their search and rescue responsibilities; and emphasizing safe, secure, and environmentally sound shipping as a matter of high priority. To ensure that future maritime development avoids negative impacts, particularly in areas of ecological and cultural significance, the Arctic Council is also continuing its work towards a network of marine protected areas and enhanced international cooperation in the Arctic Ocean. Ocean acidification is one of the most urgent issues facing the world’s ocean today and the Arctic Council is responding by supporting research to improve the capability to monitor and track acidification in the Arctic Ocean.
Our work in this area will aim to:
- Better prepare those responsible to better address search and rescue challenges in the Arctic;
- Ensure marine environmental protection, including working toward the establishment of a network of marine protected areas;
- Explore the creation of a Regional Seas Program of the Arctic Ocean;
- Create a better understanding of Arctic Ocean acidification and its effects on Arctic organisms and the economies that rely on them;
- Encourage all parties take the steps necessary to allow for the proper implementation of the Agreement on Cooperation on Marine Oil Pollution, Preparedness and response in the Arctic.
3. Addressing the Impacts of Climate Change
The impacts of climate change affect the Arctic and the many people, wildlife, and plants that depend on the region for survival. The United States recognizes that we need to reduce black carbon (soot) and methane emissions, which disproportionally impact the Arctic. The Arctic Council is addressing the impacts of climate change by facilitating cooperation on action to reduce black carbon and methane emissions. Arctic Council activities to enhance access to adaptation and resilience tools, and promote the development of climate change indicators and high-resolution mapping are also priorities of the U.S. chairmanship that will increase scientists’, communities’, policymakers’ and the public’s understanding of the impacts of climate change.
Our work in this area will aim to:
- Target short-lived climate pollutants through reductions in black carbon and methane emissions;
- Support Arctic climate adaptation and resilience efforts including the creation of an Early Warning Indicator System;

After a frightfully divisive and agonisingly protracted US presidential campaign, with votes still being counted at this time and with results that continue to be contested by the incumbent, the graciousness of the projected victor ushered in a sense of relief that made his triumph all the sweeter – to those who supported him and to the many who simply wished to move on. The first address of the former Vice-President of the United States, now as President-Elect, set the tone of the incoming administration as inspiring, unifying and healing from the outset. The message was clear: the manifold wounds of the nation shall now be treated with the soothing and fragrant Balm of Gilead. Moderation is the need of the hour.
Beyond the saccharine platitudes, the multiverse of promises and the misty high-level priorities, what would a Biden Presidency look like in practice? Arguably, it would have much more substance than a cynic might like to admit, with Biden inheriting from the Obama Presidency and his own time as Vice-President a legacy of ideas, policies, programmes, networks and structures so recent that, despite coming under a few years of heavy attack, still have enough life in them to be rescued, resuscitated and retrofitted for the current time. While Biden’s pledges on climate will bring the US more in line with the UK, Canada and its Nordic partners, how will the Arctic feature on his agenda? Polar Research and Policy Initiative (PRPI) stands ready to support the Biden Administration in crafting a sound, effective and globally respected US Arctic policy.
Here is our list of 20 recommendations that we hope will inform US Arctic engagement during the Biden Presidency:
Develop a US Arctic policy that builds on, and recognises the interdependence between, three pillars – sustainable development, environmental stewardship and indigenous engagement; integrates local, tribal, regional and federal needs, interests and priorities; and clearly communicates to the nation and the world the importance that the US places on the Arctic.
Appoint a Climate Task Force, re-join the Paris Climate Agreement, set goals enabling the transition to a net zero carbon economy by 2035; invest in clean energy and infrastructure; and work closely with the UK in ensuring a successful 26th UN Climate Change Conference (COP 26) in Glasgow in 2021 that features the Arctic prominently on its agenda.
Reiterate support to the UN’s 2030 Agenda on Sustainable Development; outline the relevance and importance of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to the Arctic in US Arctic policy; and create a President’s State, Local and Tribal Leaders Task Force on Sustainable Development, akin to President Obama’s on Climate Preparedness & Resilience.
Re-affirm the commitment of the US to Arctic cooperation, working with, and through, the Arctic Council as the principal intergovernmental forum promoting cooperation in the region; and consider in advance how its emphasis on Arctic cooperation will manifest in practice once Iceland’s chairmanship ends and Russia’s chairmanship commences in 2021.
Articulate a more holistic vision of Arctic security, one that acknowledges the extent to which ‘domain awareness’ has redefined the traditional military focus, while a new human rights discourse undercuts traditional ways of managing sovereignty and territory, and accepts that military, human and environmental security can no longer be understood/treated as separate.
Conceive a new security relationship within the North American Arctic, one that focuses on current and emerging conventional and non-conventional threats to security – increasingly transnational in their scope – that confront the region as a whole and that shape relationships between, and within, the US, Canada and Greenland.
Revitalise cooperation with Canada and Greenland to devise transnational responses to regional challenges that often transcend physical state-instituted and -controlled borders, such as climate change, shipping accidents, disasters, environmental pollution, human trafficking, opioid smuggling and aero-spatial military challenges in the North American Arctic.
Focus on improving border governance in the Yukon-British Columbia-Alaska borderland region by recognising how and why northern borders differ, and the dangers and pitfalls of importing and imposing border management paradigms from elsewhere – especially southern borderlands – that are insensitive to the specific needs, interests and priorities in the North.
Move away from ‘high’ border management models that treat all borders alike and represent ultimately distant, elite interests to a ‘low’ border management model that recognises diversity and variation in different borders and promotes an asymmetric approach that is more sensitive and responsive to local cooperation and co-production of border management and integrity.
Recognise that indigenous peoples have the right to have relationships and engage in cultural and economic activities with their people who live in communities that straddle international borders, and ensure they are included in discussions about cross-border mobility to build greater awareness across government about their rights and eliminate restrictions to mobility.
Re-frame ‘border management’ in the North American Arctic from conveying simply a state’s ability to control its borders to a willingness on the part of state actors across borders to work with local and non-state actors in developing borderlands into zones for cross-border cooperation and viable regional economies, learning from the Kolarctic CBC programme.
Acknowledge the limitations of formal disaster governance institutions and mechanisms to respond to situations where cross-border disaster risk reduction and response efforts are necessary; and proactively build the capacity and readiness of informal disaster governance mechanisms to enhance community-based resilience against shocks and stresses.
Note that one great challenge to US Arctic security is the lack of adequate infrastructure, and consider the need for military, civilian and private collaboration to leverage finance in developing an integrated infrastructure network – marine, aviation and telecommunications – that works for all and that strengthens the position of the US Arctic on the global stage.
Support the building of a deep-water port in the US Arctic – ideally, expanding the port at Nome – that would be valuable both for US naval forces and for commercial cargo ships, bulk freighters and LNG carriers, paving the way for safe, secure and reliable commerce in the region, given that the entire Arctic coastline of Alaska presently lacks a deep-draft port.
Focus on developing telecommunications infrastructure to improve connectivity in the Arctic, which matters just as much for education, employment and general well-being, as it does for environmental monitoring and forecasting, search and rescue operations, ship-to-ship and ship-to-shore communications, military communication and domain awareness.
Reinvigorate defence and security cooperation in the Arctic, North Atlantic and North Pacific regions with northern allies and partners, such as the UK, Canada, Greenland, Faroe Islands, Iceland, Denmark, Norway, Finland and Sweden, and expand the scope of the Five Eyes (US-UK-Canada-Australia-New Zealand) alliance to include polar cooperation.
Appreciate the strategic importance of Greenland – from its vast resource potential to its waterways, airways and port and airport infrastructure – to the US and its North American and European allies, and ensure the US continues to prioritise its relationship with, strengthen its diplomatic presence within, and commit to infrastructure investment in, Greenland.
Realise that the majority of mining firms that hold exploration or exploitation licenses in Greenland are British, Australian and Canadian, rendering a Five Eyes Task Force on Building Stable, Secure, Sustainable Supply Chains of Critical Minerals, such as rare earth elements, the logical next step in the quest to reduce dependence on China and enhance resource security.
At the domestic level, ensure that policymakers shaping US Arctic policy regularly consult, and consider the concerns, needs, interests and priorities of, local communities in the US Arctic, as well as the two US states (Alaska and Maine) and two US regions (Pacific Northwest and New England) most engaged in Arctic affairs.
Increase the staffing of the White House’s Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) to ensure the Arctic, among other topics, is adequately covered within the White House, and revive the Arctic Executive Steering Committee to coordinate Arctic efforts across federal agencies and with state, local and tribal governments, academia, industry and civil society.
Some of these recommendations are drawn from my volume The North American Arctic: Themes in Regional Security (London: UCL Press, 2019) that I had the privilege of co-editing with Professor Heather Nicol of Trent University and that was based on three annual workshops on North American Arctic Security we had co-hosted in Canada (2017), the US (2018) and the UK (2019).
At Polar Research and Policy Initiative (PRPI), we are committed to seeing the US set the gold standard for Arctic engagement domestically and globally, and look forward to the next few years of fruitful cooperation with the US on all things Arctic. The Biden-Harris administration almost uniquely has every advantage proffered by hindsight and foresight to build on the Obama-Biden administration’s legacy and go further still, putting flesh on the bones of its priorities and crafting a sound, effective and globally respected US Arctic policy.

The Kingdom and its populations have over several hundred years developed modern and sustainable societies based on democratic principles. The development has affected all sectors of society - from education, health and research to the environment, trade and shipping. At the same time, huge and sweeping changes are taking place today in the Arctic. Due to climate change and technological developments, vast economic potential is becoming more accessible.
With new opportunities come new challenges. The Arctic has to be managed internationally on the basis of international principles of law to ensure a peaceful, secure and collaborative Arctic.
The Kingdom is already a vigorous and important actor in the strategically vital international cooperation on the future of the Arctic and in that connection attaches great importance to creating transparency in and understanding for cooperation.
In the Kingdom’s strategy for the Arctic 2011- 2020, the Government, the Government of the Faroes and the Government of Greenland have set out the most important opportunities and challenges as we see them today and in the near future. On that basis we have defined our common political objectives for the Arctic.
We will – through close cooperation in the Kingdom and with our international partners - work towards the common overall goal of creating a peaceful, prosperous and sustainable future for the Arctic.

5 June 2018
The Arctic’s challenges are vast and deep, writes TIMO KOIVUROVA: The region is warming at twice the rate of the global average, ice and snow are melting, ecosystems are transforming — and Indigenous and local cultures are struggling to adapt.
GLOBAL WARMING is caused by activities elsewhere in the world, yet Arctic communities feel the impact most acutely. For example, environmental pollutants are driven north by changing wind patterns. Arctic mines and the jobs that go with them open and close based on swings in global market prices, causing economic insecurity in the region.
Given the influence of global processes on the Arctic’s fortunes, it is critical that we make the connection between global work on sustainable development, on the one hand, and Arctic work on the other. Finland, the current chair of the Arctic Council, made it a priority to look to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)—adopted by the nation-states of the world—to serve as the council’s guiding framework. It is crucial that the council continue this work because it will inform the UN’s post-2030 development agenda. Unfortunately, global sustainable development frameworks still do not reflect the Arctic’s priorities. That needs to change. The Arctic and its unique features are critically important to the health of our planet.
While nation-states around the world are responsible for realizing the SDGs, the Arctic Council can play a role in supporting their work. The council has been working on sustainable development questions in their various dimensions (economic, social and environmental) for more than 20 years, so it is well positioned to help Arctic countries meet the 17 SDGs and their 169 targets.
We need to create mechanisms to scrutinize how we can use the SDGs to promote sustainable development in the Arctic. If we want the SDGs to really advance sustainable development, we need to ensure they reflect the Arctic’s special conditions. The traditional livelihoods of the Arctic—such as berry picking, hunting and reindeer herding—are good examples of what is unique about the region.
We must capture the reality of traditional livelihoods like these and understand their importance in the Arctic. This is not going to be easy. In the Arctic, traditional livelihoods are important not only economically, but culturally and spiritually. How can we develop indicators that speak to their importance? If we cannot properly take account of traditional livelihoods, it is hard to see how we will advance sustainable development in the region.
Since many changes in the Arctic have their origins outside the region, it is important for Arctic countries and peoples to take “Arctic messages” to global forums. Sustainable development in the Arctic is going to be very difficult if the rest of the world does not understand how its actions affect the region, and cannot or will not acknowledge its responsibility. One such opportunity is the UN High-Level Political Forum, which oversees the implementation of the SDGs. This forum should highlight the fact that the actions of faraway nations have dire consequences for sustainable development in the Arctic.
As Timo Soini, Finland’s foreign minister and current chair of the Arctic Council, argued at the Rovaniemi Arctic Spirit conference in November 2017, sustainable development is not just wishful thinking. It is nothing less than an international strategy for survival.

While the U.S. Coast Guard is working hard to protect American interests in the Arctic, including the wellbeing of those in remote regions of Alaska, it has to operate aging equipment on a tight budget. Rear Adm. Matthew Bell, commander of Coast Guard District 17, joins Left of Boom to discuss a rare winter deployment to the Arctic for the nation’s only heavy icebreaker, the Polar Star, and how the Coast Guard defends U.S. sovereignty without inflaming international tensions.

Military Rivalry in the Arctic
The following is an edited transcript of this episode of Left of Boom:
Hope Hodge Seck 0:00
Welcome back to Left of Boom. I'm your host, Hope Hodge Seck. What do you think of when you picture the Arctic? Ice-locked seas, Polar bears and the Northern Lights -- perhaps the North Pole and its Santa Claus mythology? Well, for the U.S. military and several of its major competitors, the Arctic is the location of a new battle for strategic dominance, with impacts on national defense, economic activity, food security and safety of transit. Big changes over the last several decades, including warming trends that have seen 95% of the perennial ice at the Arctic Circle disappear within the last 35 years, mean the Arctic is more accessible than ever, and seeing significant increases in commercial and military activity. But even though the United States is one of eight geographically designated Arctic nations, it's poorly resourced for Arctic presence. Its one heavy icebreaker, the Polar Star has been in service since 1976, and is overdue for retirement. The first of a replacement class of icebreakers is years from delivery. Is the United States going to lose the new battle for Arctic dominance? To help us understand the stakes of this new fight for dominance, we're joined today by Rear Adm. Matthew Bell, commander of the 17th Coast Guard District, which covers Alaska, the Arctic Ocean and the Bering Sea. In addition to being our first Coast Guard guest, Adm. Bell is a career cutterman who has spent a significant portion of his career stationed in Alaska.
Adm. Bell, welcome to the show.
Adm. Matthew Bell 1:38
Alright, thanks. So good to be here.
Hope Hodge Seck 1:40
So to start out, I did want to ask about this new deployment that was just announced of the U.S.'s only operational heavy icebreaker, the Polar Star, which usually heads to Antarctica and is now going to the Arctic. I understand that is a decision that was made due to COVID conditions and some other things. But I'm really curious what the Polar Star will be doing on this rare deployment to the Arctic and what opportunities that represents.
Adm. Matthew Bell 2:09
Right, so very fortunate for us to have the nation's I call it their sole heavy icebreaker deployed to the northern high latitudes this winter in support of we'll call it Coast Guard's Arctic strategy. I think beginning in mid-December, the Polar Star is gonna conduct 80-plus days or so deployment to the Arctic to expand our coverage to conduct Coast Guard missions, patrol the U.S.-Russia maritime boundary line, contribute to maritime domain awareness, probably strengthen international intergovernmental partnerships, and of course, protect U.S. presence and sovereignty. The deployment will obviously support three lines of effort from Coast Guard's Arctic strategic outlook and enhance capability to operate effectively and strengthen rules-based order, and then innovate and adapt to promote resilience and prosperity there in the Arctic. I think primarily, they'll be operating in the Bering and Chukchi Seas, looking for first-year ice with supporting logistics stops out of Dutch Harbor. And of course, this provides a great opportunity to refine and develop future generation of icebreaker operators.
Hope Hodge Seck 3:13
Hmm. So you talked about patrolling the U.S.-Russia maritime boundary line Why is that important? And is that something that Coast Guard would like to do more of?
Adm. Matthew Bell 3:23
So it's unique, I mean, from a Coast Guard perspective, we are one of the few countries that has territories above the Arctic Circle, right. And obviously, I'll call it stating the obvious, we have a shared border with Russia and Canada, in the Arctic. So from a national security perspective, national sovereignty perspective, it only behooves the United States to actively patrol that maritime boundary line that's literally between the two countries. We have a great, I'll call it working relationship with the Russian border guard, especially for law enforcement, fisheries efforts, that's along the maritime boundary line in the Bering Sea. Well, that same maritime boundary line is as appropriate and connected up through the Bering Straits and up into the Arctic in the Chukchi Sea. So we've been able to mutually patrol that line with us and the Russians, ensures that, that our interests are best represented, certainly by the Coast Guard.
Hope Hodge Seck 4:15
Do you ever see anything that concerns you, concerns the Coast Guard, from that area? Or is this mainly to prevent any kind of problems from happening?
Adm. Matthew Bell 4:25
No, we see concerns. I think every day I can go back to you know, my first patrol up here in Alaska waters in the mid '80s was dealing with foreign fishing vessels, Russian fishing vessels in and around the maritime boundary line. Those were some of our first initial boarding efforts, specifically about fisheries, law enforcement there in the Bering Sea that continues today. Just here, a couple of months back we had Russia doing an exercise in the Bering Sea and their ships and aircraft came into U.S. [exclusive economic zone] to conduct that exercise that was kind of new and developmental from the perspective -- Russia has always been up here. But to have them actually come on on our side ... to conduct parts of that exercise was new. The Russian border guard has had I'll call it a continual presence in and around Diomede since the early summer, those ships just recently departed. But that's been a continual presence by the Russian border guard that I've not seen up here, certainly in in this tour. We'll likely see increased activity up in the Chakchi Sea even as early as next summer as Russia looks to open up a fisheries, there, north of the Arctic Circle, which of course the ice has been kept most folks out in the past, we've not seen that level of fishing activity in past history.
Hope Hodge Seck 5:45
Hmm. And you raise some really good points there when it comes to the existing security threats and how the region is changing. I think a lot of people understand when you talk about Europe or the Pacific, or China, you know, what the threats are, we need to shore up militarily. But when it comes to the Arctic, can you sort of give you the 30-second elevator pitch of you know, what change is happening? You know, how the the shape of the the ice and climate is affecting that, and why the U.S. does need to maintain a presence there?
Adm. Matthew Bell 6:17
Really good question. I mean, I kind of just said it before. I mean, it's obvious we have land interest in the Arctic, we share that common border with Russia and Canada. The Arctic is strategically important, you know, a significant amount of the world's undiscovered gas and oil and mineral reserves, and more than half -- and just just think about that -- more than half of the U.S. fishing stocks come from the U.S.'s exclusive economic zone. Here off the coast of Alaska, melting ice is opening up those sea lanes that never existed before. And it's becoming more accessible, which means more exploration, more tourism or shipping. Possible conflicts, as I think, world powers look to compete for their stake in ... increased international activity up here directly impacts our sovereignty, competing demands for resources, increased shipping traffic, I think will bring those risks closer to our shores, and closer to potential conflict and environmental catastrophes. That's why it's important for us to ensure safe, secure and environmentally responsive maritime activities in the Arctic, looking to protect species potential access to food sources, are linked to longterm conservation efforts that require enforcement and oversight for which the Coast Guard has adapted over the years. Again, the nation's consistent maritime presence in the region is the Coast Guard, we continue to provide increasing valuable partnerships, maritime domain awareness, search-and-rescue capabilities, icebreaking, of course, fisheries, enforcement and vessel and facility safety examination. It's interesting, the area is huge. It's incredibly remote. And it's difficult to provide that challenge. Other nations like China and Russia, specifically, they've invested -- huge -- in presence and are pushing the boundaries up there, we need to be able to respond accordingly. And I think in order for the United States to protect its sovereign interests in the Arctic, and possibly shape that future governance, it needs the capability to project presence 365 days a year, I mean, our Arctic strategy talks about presence equals influence.
Hope Hodge Seck 8:15
So I've read the documents, there are seven other Arctic nations if you're going geographically, in addition to the U.S. And then there's this wild card, China, which calls itself a near-Arctic nation, which is a very confusing term, based on its own geography. What is the level of Chinese activity in the region? And should we be concerned about what they're doing and what they're trying to do?
Adm. Matthew Bell 8:39
So I think we should we should all be concerned about that. I mean, we could talk about near peer competitiveness, you know, Arctic nations are what they are, there's eight of them. That's where it ends. Now, there are other folks that have interests. And there's other folks that have desires and pursuits in the region, they certainly can look to do that. I find it interesting that when we start talking about Chinese influence, they have an icebreaker. The Xue Long 2, is up here this summer, and just recently transited through the Bering Straits and through the Bering Sea heading back to China. And I didn't have a ship that could steam alongside them, or steam in the Arctic or into the ice alongside Xue Long. So does that put us at a disadvantage, perhaps. And we're kind of, going back to the Polar Star coming up here this winter, we have the cutter Healy that operates up there routinely. So those will kind of hold them in check, if you will. But if they want to continue their pursuits to generate additional access to the Arctic, that's only going to require the U.S. to be able to respond it with with appropriate resources in the region.
Hope Hodge Seck 9:43
You talk about resources and you talked about the seven other Arctic nations. How does U.S. investment in things like icebreakers and Arctic security, compare to, let's talk about, I guess, the major Arctic nations like Russia and Canada?
Adm. Matthew Bell 9:58
So in short, again, it's, from Matt Bell's perspective here in Alaska, we're lagging behind. But I think current investments will be closing the gap over the next few years. Recent contract awards for the Polar Security Cutter, the offshore patrol cutters. Those are all going to be great, great progress. I think fielding upgrading upgrades for the C-130Js, out to Kodiak, patrols to Alaska District 17 and the Arctic by our national security cutters are huge steps to influencing that proverbial battlespace. Russia and China exemplify that competition. Both have declared the Arctic a strategic priority. We've known that both have made significant investments in new and refurbished capabilities. And I think both are exerting direct and indirect influence across the region. Relationship-wise, I think we have the advantage of a history of providing the nation's most consistent maritime presence since the mid-1800s. We have enduring relationships with those that work, travel and live up here in the last frontier. I think speaking toward Canada, in the area of Arctic research, I can report that you know, one of our two icebreakers, the Healy plans to make a return deployment to the Arctic in summer of 2021 to do research and engage in other missions in and around the Arctic Ocean. I can also highlight that the Canadian icebreaker, the Sir Wilfrid Laurier, has conducted research in the U.S. Arctic waters annually for years now, as the Coast Guard continues in its program to recapitalize the nation's icebreaker fleet. With the commissioning of the Polar Security Cutters over the next decade, I believe the opportunity to enhance those international cooperations in the Arctic research will grow, along with many other critical facets of U.S. national security and defense in the region. And to that last point, the U.S. Coast Guard is very specifically focused on Arctic research, and has been with the Healy for years now. I think as our Polar Security Cutters come online, I think you're gonna see us expand that mission set, still doing some research, but then accommodate the other Coast Guard missions in and around the Arctic. And we'll see that this coming winter with Polar Star coming up. Their mission will be Coast Guard mission sets, and not necessarily focused on Coast Guard, Arctic research.
Hope Hodge Seck 12:14
If you had every platform, every piece of gear on your wish list in terms of carrying this out, what would that look like? What would the Coast Guard be able to do in the Arctic on kind of a regular basis?
Adm. Matthew Bell 12:27
Wow. So that's an interesting question. If I had it all, I guess I would sleep really, really, really well and not have a lot to do. Because much of the work that I do here as the district commander is talking about, you know, competing priorities and competing interests throughout the Coast Guard. So how best can we articulate those needs, those demands and mitigate that risk here in the state, I think if we were granted all of those resources, we would have, that would put us a permanent presence in the Arctic, which would directly imply influence that would allow us to further the U.S., I'll call it influence in the region. And that's whether that's, you know, assisting with our Canadian partners, or whether that's building that relationship with Russia, or continuing to influence the science-based or research-based decisions for global order or for that access that folks like China want to gain in the region. And I also think, too, that it would provide a level of security or calm amongst all the inhabitants that live here, here in Alaska, because they would see the same resources, they would see the same services, they would see the same support requirements that we see or experience in the Lower 48.
Hope Hodge Seck 13:37
So on the other side of the coin, now there's one heavy icebreaker. And it does seem to get into trouble, a fair amount just because it's old. And there's a sort of downpayment on the first in its class, new polar icebreaker or Polar Security Cutter. And it's assumed that more are coming. I think at least three are needed, if I understand correctly. So it seems like we're in a tight spot right now. What kind of scenarios in the Arctic keep you up at night? I mean, you talked about not being able to accompany the Chinese icebreaker. So what scenarios keep you up at night? And how does the Coast Guard work to ensure that worst-case scenario doesn't happen?
Adm. Matthew Bell 14:21
Yeah. So, you know, I would say there's not a lot that keeps me up at night. There's lots of things that I'm concerned about or worried about. But at the end of the day, I sleep pretty well. I've got a great staff, we've got folks that are really, really focused on what the priority mission sets are up here and especially working to mitigate that risk. I think we face all sorts of threats in the Arctic. I mean, it's the tyranny of distance, the lack of infrastructure, the dynamic and extreme weather events. I mean, all of those make it particularly challenging to respond to distress or pollution cases, protect our fisheries. I think our national sovereignty is tested daily by foreign nations. You know, melting ice caps, open sea lanes, the potential for conflict will challenge our country's capacity. And all of those challenges will have an effect on our native subsistence ... influencing our own nation's food sovereignty. I think from a personal perspective here as the district commander, our greatest threat would be the inability to generate a response, or an inadequate response to a catastrophic event event, growing maritime activity, or the presence of peer competitors. I think our ability to influence what happens in the Arctic is predicated on our ability to defend our interests here, as the nation's consistent maritime presence in the region, the Coast Guard uses our available resources to continue providing increased value partnerships, maritime domain awareness, search and rescue icebreaking, fisheries enforcement, you know, and so forth. We go through vessel security exams -- I think the short answer is we can always use more resources, right, especially in Alaska, to combat that tyranny of distance and lack of infrastructure. We talked about it we talked about all the time you already mentioned, we have two icebreakers, they're 20 and 50 years old respectively, they deploy worldwide, and not just here in the Arctic. The Polar Security Cutter acquisitions is going to be a game-changer for us, it's going to influence that. I think, geographically, you can just look here in the state, we have two Coast Guard Air Stations, routinely launching our missions that are equivalent from flying from Boston to Orlando. We have a relatively small handful of cutters that patrol an area I think almost the size of the United States. And I don't want to try to overstate that. But when we talk about that the vast distances and the challenges we have up here, it can't go understated. We deploy those assets, I think strategically, to provide the greatest effectiveness, given maritime traffic, the fishing seasons, the weather phenomenon. We just can't be everywhere at once. So let me talk about a partnership just as an example. So we have a very good relationship with NORAD, NORTHCOM and the Department of Defense, they help us paint the picture of activity in the Arctic, so that we can help make a sense of what's going on strategically to employ those assets and those resources. And I think in order to make the best use of those assets we have, we strategically placed them where the greatest need is, whether that's standing up a forward operating base for our helicopters to use up based on fishing activity, or deploying a cutter to patrol that maritime boundary line that we discussed a little earlier. And we also use our partnerships and our relationships with our Russian and the Canadian neighbors, to expedite rescues and pollution and prevention activities along along our shared borders. We monitor vessel traffic and and we rely on mariners to report concerns in areas where there's gaps in that coverage, which came out of the Ocean Shield exercise that Russia was conducting this summer. But those fishermen that were operating out there on the extreme western edge of the Bering Sea contacted us, basically, it's a team effort, and we're making the best use of the resources we have given those definite constraints that we have for distance and lack of resources.
Hope Hodge Seck 18:08
So some fishermen and mariners contacted you all and said, we see some Russian ships operating here, and that was news. And that alerted you to be able to go out and respond to that?
Adm. Matthew Bell 18:19
It did and ironically, so when they first called us, our nearest ship was in Dutch Harbor, it's a three to five-day steam for our cutter to get up there. You know, and kind of going back to your previous question, if we had all the resources, there would already be a ship or there already be an asset in the vicinity of the maritime boundary line or up off of Diomede. But with that, at that particular time, there was one asset in the Bering Sea and a three day steam for them. Actually, it took them five days because the weather kind of picked up, because that's usually what the weather does here. When you need to do a case it gets a little rough and impacts those operators.
Hope Hodge Seck 18:55
Of course. Well, I want to ask a couple of follow ups based on you know what, you just shared -- a lot of really good stuff, but you used the term a while back food security or food sovereignty. And I was hoping you could unpack what you mean by that. Obviously, we're talking about shipping lanes, and I assume that's a part of it.
Adm. Matthew Bell 19:16
So macroscopically, that there's another document out called IUU. So So illegal, unreported, unregulated fishing. I mean, that's a global approach to managing, I'll call it, you know, ocean protein stocks across the world. Well, if you look at that from a microcosm here in the state, you know, we've got some of the world's best-managed fisheries around the state, whether that's the salmon runs in and out of Bristol Bay, whether that's the federally managed halibut fisheries that we have across the state to the point where our native communities rely on subsistence hunts, whether that's off of Utqiagvik and to the north, or to those sockeye runs there in Bristol Bay or even here to the southeast for the many fisheries that they can operate in. All of those dictate how well or how prosperous a community can be, or how well and prosperous a state can be. And so it requires good management, it requires good governance, it requires good enforcement, it requires good follow-up to ensure all those aspects of that food chain is secure, or is managed effectively, to where one entity doesn't end up, you know, being able to reap all the benefits at the expense of others. So when you look at some small communities, up in the northern part of the state, you know, they rely on a very short window to get their hunt done, or their fishing done, that basically fulfills that the whole community's food locker or freezer, if you will, for the coming months. So if you're going to impact that very, very short window, their food security, their food sovereignty, is in jeopardy that that requires the Coast Guard, requires those local communities to protect that resource, whether you want to call it a natural resource, or a village resource, or a native resource, all of those require Coast Guard actions to be able to support.
Hope Hodge Seck 21:05
There is so much that goes into Arctic operations as as you go down the list, and it affects so many pieces of American life. Does it still make sense for the Coast Guard to own this significant military mission? I know in some ways, it's a really good fit enforcement and working with fisheries and working on the coast. And on the other side, I know that the Defense Department gets a lot more funding, a lot more resources, and they also get a lot more attention with military operations. So yeah, I know, it's a controversial question. But, you know, why does it make sense for the Coast Guard to continue to own Arctic security?
Adm. Matthew Bell 21:47
So I would approach that question from our statutory authorities. And we can talk about Title 10 or Title 14, and we kind of migrate from one to the other depending on what the threats and the circumstances are. From that aspect, I think the Coast Guard is uniquely positioned based on those authorities to work through, regulate through and operate in and around the Arctic. It's a whole-of-goverment issue, I would say that upfront. It's a whole of government issue, from whether it's Department of State or Department of Defense, Department of the Interior. All of my state partners here in the state, all of the partnerships or relationships we have with the 230-plus native tribes here in Alaska, requires all of us to do that. So I want to be careful when you say, Oh, the Coast Guard should be in charge of that. I'm not sure that the Coast Guard even with you know, 50,000 strong could be responsible or own all of that mission set, because it is so complex, because it is so dynamic. From an operations perspective, from a policy perspective, from a regulatory perspective, I think the Coast Guard is well positioned to do that. What I certainly like to have DoD's budget, absolutely. But at the same time, I would never want to give up our own Coast Guard statutory authorities that we have under the Department of Homeland Security, because our law enforcement additions, our search and rescue missions, our prevention missions are much more enabling for the Coast Guard to interact with those coastal communities than they would be from a Department of Defense perspective. And that relationship that we have with our Department of Defense counterparts is critical, because they rely on the information that we're gathering the information that we look at, they use it to inform their battle orders at the same time, the information that they garner, that they gain are able to influence our own operations and our own enforcement actions here across the state.
Hope Hodge Seck 23:34
Apart from icebreaker operations, are there any ways that Coast Guard is training or operating differently with regard to the Arctic today than it has in previous years, even 10 years ago?
Adm. Matthew Bell 23:46
The short answer is yes. Part of that is just because of the accessibility that we have to the Arctic. You know, historically, Healy has been up here for a number of years, and does research. I'll call it in the middle of the summer, because it provides easy access. I mean, the ice is still there. But it's thinner, there's greater leads, so they can provide greater access for them to do that science mission and the Coast Guard cooperates with the National Science Foundation to do that Arctic research. And that's been primarily the focus behind Healy. I think what we'll see with Polar Star this coming winter, plus the advent of what we're going to see while the Polar Security Cutter is coming online is a greater adaptation, a greater work toward all of the Coast Guard mission sets up in and around the Arctic. The Arctic is accessible, technically 365. We can do that with ships that are capable of breaking the ice but we can get there via aircraft we can get there via personnel we can get there via innovation. So there's lots of different ways to access and influence the Arctic, which we're already doing. We have an annual surge of operations during the summer, which we call Arctic Shield that provides a mobile expeditionary capacity that we get in some of those communities that we talked about, search and rescue. We talked about engagement. We talked about training that we can provide to the to the local elements. There, we even look at our own coastal and facilities inspections to ensure that old fuel tanks or new fuel tanks along the coastlines are intact and are up to current standards, to ensure that we're not polluting the environment or having a negative impact on the environment. All of that requires year-round effort to influence those operations in and around the Arctic. If we just focused on icebreaking. Well, icebreaking is is a capability. Okay, so if we can break the ice, all that does now is now enable those mission sets to search and rescue, to law enforcement, to prevention efforts that would provide, you know, our larger influence from a Coast Guard perspective.
Hope Hodge Seck 25:45
And nobody likes to speculate too broadly, when you're talking about the future, anything could happen. But what do you see 10 or 15 years down the road in terms of what you predict might be happening in the Arctic then, and what might change in terms of that region's impact on our national security on global affairs? You know, what are what do the trends say to you?
Adm. Matthew Bell 26:07
The Arctic, I think it's strategically important, right? And I think the Coast Guard is or should be well-positioned to provide mobile, and expeditionary mission service to the greater Alaska, Arctic areas and those connecting waters. I see the demand signal for normal statutory services only increasing. And that's going to be in response to the growing activity, whether that's U.S. activity or that from other state actors or industry itself. I think as long as there is a geostrategic competition with near-peer competitors, and continued efforts to gain influence over the resources, the infrastructure, the sea route, I think the Coast Guard is going to play an important and I think unique national role there. The Arctic's becoming more accessible. And oh, by means whether that's going to influence exploration, tourism, shipping, conflict, I mean, all of that's not going to change our thinking. Our efforts to help with that are only going to continue to be in more demand, I think the more activity you're going to see, the more demand there's going to be for the Coast Guard, our, call it, consistent and constant maritime presence ... we have incredible valuable partnerships, we have some incredibly valuable maritime domain awareness, obviously icebreaking, fisheries enforcement, vessel safety, exam, search and rescue, all of that's going to continue to, I think, go up, the more activity you see, the more demands are going to be placed on the Coast Guard and the rest of the I'll call it state and federal resources in around the area. I don't think that's going to change anytime soon, only going to get more. And as you look at the volume of industry that's driving to the west, from Russia, coming from Yamal and through, whether that's the increased prospects of traffic, transpolar routes, or through the Northwest Passage, all of that is going to create greater demands for all of the Arctic coast guards. But for us, focused on the U.S. Coast Guard in the Arctic.
Hope Hodge Seck 28:05
it strikes me as well that the Arctic is one of those rare regions where you've got all three major global power players operating in really close proximity, potentially. And it sounds like that doesn't happen all the time at this point. But in terms of keeping conflict at bay, when when you've got Russia, China and the U.S. all operating in the same region. How do you think about that and work to keep everyone playing nicely together?
Adm. Matthew Bell 28:37
So the easy answer is effective communications. I mean, we all have to work on communications. I mean, I work on the communications internally here with the staff. I work on it with, internal to our state and federal partners, and we've worked at it internationally. The cooperative effort that we have with Canada is tremendous. We all stand technically on the same watch floor at NORAD, and NORTHCOM. So we have a mutual interest there. As I mentioned before, my Russian border guard counterpart, I can talk to them, connected-wise from command center to command center, we do that almost daily. And that's to help influence the law enforcement actions in and around the maritime boundary line. We have routine communications, we have combined ops planning, we're working on a five-year plan for a combined ops manual. So those exercises, those communications, those cooperative efforts occur regularly. I would say I'm unique in that regard from a U.S. perspective, especially when it comes to trying to talk to Russia. It's very long and complicated to talk D.C. to Moscow, and it gets very, there's lots of players involved in that conversation. But if there's something going on in the Bering Sea, I can reach out to my counterpart and have a reply back and answer back -- I'll call them in a matter of minutes. Hopefully, the communications is working back and forth, but but that communications only can help influence that. Expanding that to a bigger, larger question. The activities that you see in the Barents Sea are the activities that you see off af Greenland. That's the same Russia that operates here in the Bering Straits. And folks tend to not recognize that on occasion, because of the, I'll call it the very antagonistic behaviors that we see across all of the players in and around the North Atlantic. We don't see that as often here in the Bering Straits, because of the lack of activity. But it's just also been, there's only two nations technically that own that border between Russia and the United States. So that requires some cooperative communications between the two players here literally across the street. We do that routinely. We cooperate with Canada regularly. As we work up across the top of Alaska and over into the waters leading up to Northwest Passage, we have some great cooperative efforts to establish the Bering Straits PARS, the polar access route study. So a mutually agreed upon IMO-approved traffic through the Bering Straits. Russia was a player in that, the U.S. was a player with that, Canada was a player with that. We're working now to establish an Arctic polar access route study. So a proposed traffic, for how the traffic industry should be moving across the top of Alaska and into Canada. And those are ongoing conversations that we have, not only internationally, but also across the board through the IMO.
Hope Hodge Seck 31:22
And you talked about a combined operations plan that's under development, can you describe that in a little bit more detail, what it will be how it will work.
Adm. Matthew Bell 31:30
So we have a good working relationship with the Russian border guard, I mean, we both patrol mutually the same water, it's the same group of fish that swim around the Bering Sea, we have access to them on our side of the line, they have access to their side of the line, we want to try to approach that with a rules-based order that everybody's following the same rules. And so we try to articulate what those guidelines should look like, what the boarding parameters would be, what the question should look like, what the actions of the law enforcement vessels should be in the presence of each other. We practice communications when we're in vicinity of one another, we try to establish some routine protocols. So when we do have an issue, that we can call back directly and walk through our pre-scripted communications plan, so it affects a cleaner outcome. And it gets us through some decision points much faster. And we routinely try to work those and practice those and train through those. So that combined operating manual kind of spells those out, and it's better to have, practice them, to have drilled them, to work on them in advance than wait until something comes up or waiting for a conflict to come up and then try to make that first phone call. So that operations manual, we try to update it periodically to give us a better, I'll call a better starting point when things come up.
Hope Hodge Seck 32:41
Hmm, I think that's a great note to end on. Thank you so much for being so generous with your time. I've learned a lot and really appreciate this conversation.
Adm. Matthew Bell 32:51
Yeah, thanks, Hope it's really great. As I say, anytime I can talk about Alaska or the Coast Guard, the Arctic I'm all in ... By all means reach out, despite the time/distance, we can certainly make the time to answer some more questions. So thanks again, Hope.

The Arctic is changing. As retreating ice cover makes this region more accessible, nations with Arctic real estate are thinking of developing these subzero landscapes and the resources below.
As the Arctic evolves, a vast amount of resources will become more accessible and longer shipping seasons will improve Arctic logistics. But with a changing climate and increased public pressure to limit resource development in environmentally sensitive regions, the future of northern economic activity is far from certain.
This week’s Chart of the Week shows the location of major oil and gas fields in the Arctic and the possible new trade routes through this frontier.
A Final Frontier for Undiscovered Resources?
Underneath the Arctic Circle lies massive oil and natural gas formations. The United States Geological Survey estimates that the Arctic contains approximately 13% of the world’s undiscovered oil resources and about 30% of its undiscovered natural gas resources.
So far, most exploration in the Arctic has occurred on land. This work produced the Prudhoe Bay Oil Field in Alaska, the Tazovskoye Field in Russia, and hundreds of smaller fields, many of which are on Alaska’s North Slope, an area now under environmental protection.
Land accounts for about 1/3 of the Arctic’s area and is thought to hold about 16% of the Arctic’s remaining undiscovered oil and gas resources. A further 1/3 of the Arctic area is comprised of offshore continental shelves, which are thought to contain enormous amounts of resources but remain largely unexplored by geologists.
The remaining 1/3 of the Arctic is deep ocean waters measuring thousands of feet in depth.
The Arctic circle is about the same geographic size as the African continent─about 6% of Earth’s surface area─yet it holds an estimated 22% of Earth’s oil and natural gas resources. This paints a target on the Arctic for exploration and development, especially with shorter seasons of ice coverage improving ocean access.
Thawing Ice Cover: Improved Ocean Access, New Trading Routes
As Arctic ice melts, sea routes will stay navigable for longer periods, which could drastically change international trade and shipping. September ice coverage has decreased by more than 25% since 1979, although the area within the Arctic Circle is still almost entirely covered with ice from November to July.
|Route||Length||Ice-free Time|
|Northern Sea Route||4,740 Nautical Miles||6 weeks of open waters|
|Transpolar Sea Route||4,179 Nautical Miles||2 weeks of open waters|
|Northwest Passage||5,225 Nautical Miles||Periodically ice-free|
|Arctic Bridge||3,600 Nautical Miles||Ice-free|
Typically shipping to Japan from Rotterdam would use the Suez Canal and take about 30 days, whereas a route from New York would use the Panama Canal and take about 25 days.
But if the Europe-Asia trip used the Northern Sea Route along the northern coast of Russia, the trip would last 18 days and the distance would shrink from ~11,500 nautical miles to ~6,900 nautical miles. For the U.S.-Asia trip through the Northwest Passage, it would take 21 days, rather than 25.
Control of these routes could bring significant advantages to countries and corporations looking for a competitive edge.
Competing Interests: Arctic Neighbors
Eight countries lay claim to land that lies within the Arctic Circle: Canada, Denmark (through its administration of Greenland), Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden, and the United States.
There is no consistent agreement among these nations regarding the claims to oil and gas beneath the Arctic Ocean seafloor. However, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea provides each country an exclusive economic zone extending 200 miles out from its shoreline and up to 350 miles, under certain geological conditions.
Uncertain geology and politics has led to overlapping territorial disputes over how each nation defines and maps its claims based on the edge of continental margins. For example, Russia claims that their continental margin follows the Lomonosov Ridge all the way to the North Pole. In another, both the U.S. and Canada claim a portion of the Beaufort Sea, which is thought to contain significant oil and natural gas resources.
To Develop or Not to Develop
Just because the resources are there does not mean humans have to exploit them, especially given oil’s environmental impacts. Canada’s federal government has already returned security deposits that oil majors had paid to drill in Canadian Arctic waters, which are currently off limits until at least 2021.
In total, the Government of Canada returned US$327 million worth of security deposits, or 25% of the money oil companies pledged to spend on exploration in the Beaufort Sea. In addition, Goldman Sachs announced that it would not finance any projects in the U.S.’s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
The retreat of Western economic interests in the Arctic may leave the region to Russia and China, countries with less strict environmental regulations.
Russia has launched an ambitious plan to remilitarize the Arctic. Specifically, Russia is searching for evidence to prove its territorial claims to additional portions of the Arctic, so that it can move its Arctic borderline — which currently measures over 14,000 miles in length — further north.
In a changing Arctic, this potentially resource-rich region could become another venue for geopolitical tensions, again testing whether humans can be proper stewards of the natural world.",,Nicholas LePan,Energy|Mining|Oil and Gas|Maps,,2019-12-20,Visual Capitalist

Summary of Program Requirements
The Arctic Sciences Section (ARC) in the Office of Polar Programs (OPP) funds scientific research about the Arctic region and provides operational support for Arctic research activities. Science programs provide support for disciplinary, multidisciplinary, and convergence investigations directed at understanding the Arctic region and its connectivity with lower latitudes.
A geographic definition of the Arctic region is provided by the United States Arctic Research and Policy Act (ARPA) of 1984 Section 112. Because this solicitation includes research on phenomena that link the Arctic to lower latitudes, the ARPA definition should not be viewed as strictly constraining the location of the work proposed. Proposals conducting research outside the Arctic geographic region should contain a clear statement of how the proposed research will increase our knowledge of the Arctic.
The Arctic Sciences Section solicits proposals for research to enhance our understanding of the Arctic, from advancing fundamental disciplinary understanding of important Arctic processes to complex interdisciplinary studies of couplings among social, biological, physical, and geochemical components of the Arctic system to the changing connections between the Arctic and lower latitudes. Of special interest is research focused on understanding processes relevant to social and environmental change. All proposals should discuss explicitly how their results would contribute to increasing our understanding of the Arctic region or its interaction with global systems. Proposals should be submitted to one of the following programs but may be co-reviewed as appropriate:
Arctic Social Sciences
The Arctic Social Sciences Program (ASSP) supports research on Arctic social and cultural systems, present and past, and research relevant to understanding these systems. ASSP welcomes research proposals in all social science disciplines that are funded by the NSF Directorate of Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences. Topics of particular interest are outlined in the final report for the Arctic Horizons process. These community recommended research priorities include:
The Arctic Social Sciences Program especially encourages projects that are circumpolar and/or comparative; involve collaborations between researchers and those living in the Arctic; or form partnerships among disciplines, regions, researchers, communities, and/or students (K-12, undergraduate, or graduate). The program has a special interest in a wide range of Indigenous scholarship, including Indigenous conceived and led research projects; community participatory-based research models and knowledge coproduction; and more.
Arctic Natural Sciences
The Arctic Natural Sciences (ANS) program supports novel and creative research that is focused on disciplinary and/or interdisciplinary investigations to advance understanding of Arctic processes, including how those processes are shifting in a rapidly changing Arctic. The program encourages proposals that test hypotheses leading to new understanding of the Arctic, including those that synthesize and analyze existing data. Areas of interest include Arctic marine and terrestrial ecosystems, terrestrial hydrology, atmospheric and oceanic dynamics and climatology, and glaciological processes. Proposals may be co-reviewed with other programs at NSF, as appropriate. Where ANS participates in cross-Agency competitions, such as the Paleo Perspectives on Climate Change program, proposals should generally be submitted directly to these competitions rather than to ANS. If there is doubt as to the appropriate destination for a proposal, prospective PIs are encouraged to contact the ANS program officers prior to submission.
Arctic System Science
The Arctic System Science (ARCSS) program supports projects that study systems of the Arctic operating at multiple temporal and spatial scales, systems that can inform our understanding of Arctic processes, and the relationship of Arctic systems to other global and regional systems. For ARCSS, the “Arctic system” is defined very broadly to encourage creative proposals. PIs should ask themselves if their work addresses interactions among several components of the Arctic system, explores emergent behavior in linked subsystems, or otherwise provides essential knowledge, and they should apply that knowledge to system-level understanding.
ARCSS projects are often but not always interdisciplinary and can focus on the relationships among physical, chemical, biological, geological, ecological, social, cultural, and/or economic processes. ARCSS welcomes proposals focusing on the cycles of carbon, water, and energy in the functioning of Arctic systems, as well as the relationship of these cycles to human and social processes occurring in the Arctic. ARCSS also accepts proposals that contribute to better understanding of the interactions and feedbacks between humans and the environment. Theoretical and methodological approaches can include (but are not limited to) political ecology, historical ecology, human ecodynamics, food security, resilience theory, Indigenous and local knowledge, socioecological systems, coupled natural human systems, risk and vulnerability studies, ecosystem services, and sustainability studies. ARCSS also encourages projects aimed at creating new knowledge through synthesis of published science, reports and previously collected data to better understand the Arctic system at multiple scales.
If there is doubt as to the appropriate home for a proposal, prospective PIs are encouraged to contact the ARCSS program officer(s) prior to proposal submission
Arctic Observing Network
The Arctic Observing Network (AON) program supports proposals to make field observations to detect and understand Arctic change occurring on time scales longer than the duration of a typical NSF research grant. These projects should address major drivers and/or impacts of change and generate data that are intended for wider use by the scientific research community in understanding the changing Arctic. Proposals to develop new sensors/sensing platforms and/or to design/optimize observing strategies will also be considered. To promote broader use, AON data must promptly be made public (see Office of Polar Programs Data Management policy, NSF 16-055 for specific requirements). Data analysis may be included as part of the proposed work. Proposals may be single investigator or collaborative and include up to 5 years of observations. Continuation of observations beyond 5 years requires a successful new proposal that must demonstrate use of the previously collected data by the scientific research community.
Polar Cyberinfrastructure
The Polar Cyberinfrastructure program considers proposals that promote effective collaboration between Polar and cyberinfrastructure researchers. The Arctic Sciences Section will support proposals that provide significant benefit to the Arctic research community including (i) cost-effective transfer of data from remote field locations; (ii) long-term sustainable curatorship, standardization, management and discovery of data and metadata; (iii) visualization, manipulation, and analysis, particularly for understanding complexity; (iv) access and interoperability across scientific disciplines; (v) promotion of effective use of High Performance Computing (HPC) for direct and sustainable advances in current Arctic research; and (vi) e-learning and educational tools based on cyberinfrastructure components. Proposals that establish or enhance Virtual Organizational resources for Arctic research, and its broader impacts, are also encouraged. The Program works collaboratively with NSF’s Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure and NSF’s EarthCube program for reviewing and funding purposes.
Arctic Research Coordination and Policy Support
The Arctic Research Coordination and Policy Support (ARCPS) Program supports short- and long-term efforts to enhance communication, coordination, and collaboration across the research enterprise, which includes:
Efforts to coordinate within the Arctic research community tend to be ones that cut across the Arctic Section disciplinary portfolio, focusing on:
Successful ARCPS proposals are expected to promote new, diverse, and integrative research communities that are capable of effectively conducting and communicating research on local, regional, and global science and policy topics to enhance our understanding of the Arctic. Projects are expected to build capacity and develop approaches to synthesize results that inform policy development and/or management decisions. These efforts, in turn, will support national goals for Arctic research, including enhancing the wellbeing of Arctic residents; advancing stewardship of the Arctic environment; strengthening national and regional security; improving our understanding of the Arctic as a component of the Earth system (2019-2020 Report on the Goals and Objectives for Arctic Research, Arctic Research Commission) .
Another key goal is to support communication, coordination, and collaboration among direct stakeholders of Arctic research, including the Arctic research community and the public, including fostering partnerships with northern communities, especially Indigenous communities. These efforts may involve (but are not limited to):
Activities supported by ARCPS have included, but are not limited to, the Polar Research Board of the National Academies of Science, the Arctic Research Consortium of the U.S. (ARCUS), the Polar Geospatial Center (PGC), the Study of Environmental Arctic Change (SEARCH), and U.S. participation in coordinating bodies, such as the International Arctic Science Committee (IASC). Investigators must contact cognizant Program Officers to discuss the suitability of proposals prior to submission to ARCPS.
Types of Proposals Accepted
The Arctic Sciences Section supports research proposals and other activities that can be submitted to the Programs listed above. The following list of proposal types comprise the majority of the portfolio for the Arctic Sciences Section:
ARC would review these proposals in a single panel and may conduct site visits if appropriate. ARC may work with the project leadership to coordinate with interagency and/or international partners as needed. The decision on whether to advance the entire project would be made following review of the coordinated set of proposals and would depend on ARC’s assessment of the potential to meet the overall goals of the project.

Revised proposals must include a brief description of how the resubmitted proposal has been revised in response to reviewer and panel comments as part of the body of the Project Description section of the proposal. Please note that a revised proposal may be returned without review if the cognizant NSF Program Officer determines the revised submission has not clearly taken into account the major comments or concerns resulting from the prior NSF review.
Principles for the Conduct of Research in the Arctic
Principal Investigators are expected to incorporate the Principles for Conducting Research in the Arctic into the design, planning, execution, and completion of their research. The 2018 Principles, revised from the 1990 version by the Social Science Task Force of the U.S. Interagency Arctic Research Policy Committee (IARPC), reflect the values of the IARPC member agencies. Investigators may find these resources useful: Conducting Research with Northern Communities site by the Arctic Research Consortium of the U.S. and Fostering a Respectful Work Environment by the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) .
Proposals Involving Human Subjects
The NSF PAPPG provides procedural information for projects with human subjects in the section Proposals Involving Human Subjects. Investigators must ensure that human subjects are protected from research risks in conformance with the relevant federal policy known as the Common Rule (Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects, 45 CFR 690). Additional information is available at https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/human.jsp
Proposals Involving Arctic Field Work or Ship Time
The Arctic Research Support and Logistics (RSL) program provides support for the fieldwork of projects awarded by the Arctic Sciences Section and may support other projects on a reimbursable basis. The RSL program supports a prime logistics contract, the Arctic Research Support and Logistics Services contract, currently operated by Battelle Arctic. The RSL program also funds ship time, ice core drilling support, infrastructure support for monitoring networks, and related support for field projects. The RSL program can fund many of these third-party research support and logistics service providers directly or funds can be requested through the proposal budget. Investigators may decide how best to arrange for the logistics costs and may reach out to the RSL program managers or the cognizant science program officer to discuss these arrangements.
Proposals involving fieldwork in the Arctic must 1) describe the field activities in the body of the proposal, including a schedule of proposed work, and 2) describe the costs of the fieldwork either in the grant budget or in Supplementary Documents. The total cost of a project including fieldwork is considered at the time of review. Any science support provided by third-party organizations must be described in a 1-2 page Supplementary Document that outlines the scope of support and a cost estimate. Please allow service providers 4-6 weeks to prepare Supplementary Documents to include in proposals and initiate the request far in advance of proposal submission. For any instrument or infrastructure deployed to the field, investigators should include the scope and cost for the demobilization or other disposal of the property.
Proposals requesting support for fieldwork should expect to go to the field no sooner than 12 months after proposal submission, or 18 months for proposals including ship time requests, to allow time to plan, budget, and complete environmental compliance documentation. Per the NSF PAPPG, awardees are responsible for acquiring and complying with all permits necessary for their work and are responsible for all activities conducted under the award. NSF is not responsible for costs associated with medical evacuations or other interruptions to scheduled fieldwork and reserves the right seek reimbursement for costs incurred for search, rescue, or medical evacuation. Proposers should ensure all members of the field team are covered by institutional medical evacuation insurance or request funds to purchase medical evacuation insurance, which is an allowable grant cost. All Investigators should have a risk management plan for their fieldwork including a plan for emergencies. The ARSLS contractor can help Investigators develop these plans and offers training relevant to fieldwork.
NSF’s prime contractor for Arctic field research support is currently Battelle Arctic. For assistance from Battelle Arctic in planning field support, email arctic.planning@battelle.org. The Battelle Arctic website (https://battellearcticgateway.org/for-researchers) provides more information on services available for researchers. Frequently used field support and service organizations are listed below. Investigators should reach out to these providers directly when preparing their proposals and request a scope and cost document for the Supplementary Documents if the support has an incremental cost.
Proposals requesting ship time on U.S. Coast Guard (USCG; http://icefloe.net) or University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS; https://www.unols.org) vessels should complete a UNOLS Ship Time Request (https://strs.unols.org) and include it as Supplementary Documentation. Refer to guidance on requesting ship time here: https://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=191729&org=OCE. Please contact the ship operator for more information during proposal development. Other international and regional class vessels are available and can be arranged by Battelle. If requesting ship time on foreign research vessels, please contact Frank Rack at frack@nsf.gov to coordinate with NSF; proposals involving foreign research vessels should have Supplementary Documentation describing the scope and cost and outline the partnership arrangement with points of contact.
For work in Greenland, follow the process laid out by the Government of Greenland (http://naalakkersuisut.gl/en/About-government-of-greenland/Travel-activities-in-remote-parts-of-Greenland). In response to the requirement that researchers in remote parts of Greenland carry DKK 1,000,000 in Search and Rescue (SAR) insurance payable to the Danish State (http://naalakkersuisut.gl/en/About-government-of-greenland/Travel-activities-in-remote-parts-of-Greenland/Procedure-and-forms), NSF made an agreement with the Government of Greenland for Search and Rescue costs as a self-insured government agency. NSF provides the names of each traveler under the auspices of NSF to the Government of Greenland. NSF would coordinate SAR activities with the Government of Greenland and reserves the right to seek reimbursement for costs incurred. For work based out of Thule Air Base, please coordinate with Battelle Arctic and please reach out to Jennifer Mercer at jmercer@nsf.gov to coordinate with NSF.
Coordination and Collaborations with Arctic Communities
Given the deep knowledge held by local and Indigenous residents in the Arctic, NSF encourages scientists and Arctic residents to collaborate on Arctic research projects. NSF recognizes that these collaborations will take a variety of forms based on the nature of the scientific projects, needs of community members and organizations, and the intensity of planned collaboration. The following outlines and defines some (but not all) forms of engagement:
Research Sites Near Arctic Residents. Proposers preparing projects working near, or impacting, Arctic communities are strongly encouraged to discuss the proposed work with those communities while developing the project concept. In accordance with the Interagency Arctic Research Policy Committee (IARPC) Principles for Conducting Research in the Arctic, researchers should coordinate their field activities with nearby communities and are expected to share results with the community following each field season and/or at the end of the project. Investigators should include travel funds for this in their proposal budget. Some projects may require consultation with Tribal or subsistence co-management organizations. Time for consultation should be included in the project schedule and travel and salary funds for these consultations should be included in the proposal budget. The Arctic Research Support and Logistics (RSL) program may also support requests to visit communities and support communication with local communities. Please contact the RSL Program Officers for information about these opportunities.
Community engagement and outreach are important components of both integrative research and research capacity-building. Here, community engagement refers to substantive interaction with community partner organizations and anchor institutions such as governments, federal and state agencies, schools, libraries, health and social service providers, Tribal and Indigenous-serving organizations, non-profits, cultural organizations, and businesses. In accordance with the IARPC Principles for Conducting Research in the Arctic, investigators and community partners are encouraged to work closely to develop and evaluate creative approaches to achieving meaningful engagement for mutual benefit. Co-production of knowledge does not fall under this category for the purposes of this solicitation.
Co-production of Knowledge. Knowledge co-production with Arctic Indigenous communities is encouraged only when appropriate and must be strongly justified and supported in the proposal text and project budget. NSF identifies co-production of knowledge as the integration of different knowledge systems and methodologies to systematically understand the phenomena, systems, and processes being studied in a research project. In the Arctic, this often takes the form of Indigenous Knowledge holders and scientists working closely together to address shared research questions, pursue shared methodologies, and agree upon appropriate outreach and data sharing activities. In Greenland, it may also mean working closely with the local Greenlandic science research community. A co-produced approach includes research in which local and Indigenous peoples and organizations fully engage in the complete research process from the development of research questions, to the collection, use and stewardship of data, and interpretation and application of results. Given the diversity of peoples, worldviews, ideas, approaches, and methodologies in the Arctic, the co-production of knowledge in Arctic projects will take various forms. If intending to pursue knowledge co-production, community engagement must begin well in advance of proposal submission, and PIs are recommended to put into practice the Principles for Conducting Research in the Arctic.
Proposals that include research in communities must attach a letter or email that confirms community collaboration, or at a minimum community awareness, from the relevant community organizations (e.g., Alaska Native corporations or non-profits, tribal councils, municipal governments, and/or school authorities, or Greenlandic research institutes) as a Supplementary Document. Investigators should request sufficient funding to support the time and travel of Arctic community members and treat their collaborators as members of their research team, including acknowledging collaborators in publications and including them as co-authors and in research presentations, as appropriate.
Environmental Policy Considerations of Fieldwork
Federal agencies must comply with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and other applicable laws and policies such as the Endangered Species Act, the Marine Mammal Protection Act, and the National Historic Preservation Act. Projects will be assessed for environmental impacts prior to award and additional consultations or mitigation efforts may be required. PIs should expect to be involved in the assessment and environmental compliance process for their projects. Investigators may need to travel to communities or meetings as part of the environmental compliance for projects and should request these funds in their award. The RSL program may also provide travel funds if needed to ensure that appropriate consultation takes place. Researchers proposing work that may affect cultural or historic properties, or whose work involves tribal lands, must cooperate with NSF in complying with the consultation requirements of section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act and the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA). For additional information on cultural or historic preservation issues, see the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation's web site at http://www.achp.gov/work106.html; for information concerning NAGPRA see http://www.nps.gov/nagpra/. Contact the Environmental Officer of the Office of Polar Programs, Dr. Polly Penhale (ppenhale@nsf.gov) for guidance on environmental consultations, permitting, and NSF's obligations under existing environmental laws.

After proposers have received an e-mail notification from NSF, Research.gov should be used to check the status of an application.
Proposals received by NSF are assigned to the appropriate NSF program for acknowledgement and, if they meet NSF requirements, for review. All proposals are carefully reviewed by a scientist, engineer, or educator serving as an NSF Program Officer, and usually by three to ten other persons outside NSF either as ad hoc reviewers, panelists, or both, who are experts in the particular fields represented by the proposal. These reviewers are selected by Program Officers charged with oversight of the review process. Proposers are invited to suggest names of persons they believe are especially well qualified to review the proposal and/or persons they would prefer not review the proposal. These suggestions may serve as one source in the reviewer selection process at the Program Officer's discretion. Submission of such names, however, is optional. Care is taken to ensure that reviewers have no conflicts of interest with the proposal. In addition, Program Officers may obtain comments from site visits before recommending final action on proposals. Senior NSF staff further review recommendations for awards. A flowchart that depicts the entire NSF proposal and award process (and associated timeline) is included in PAPPG Exhibit III-1.
A comprehensive description of the Foundation's merit review process is available on the NSF website at: https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/.
Proposers should also be aware of core strategies that are essential to the fulfillment of NSF's mission, as articulated in Building the Future: Investing in Discovery and Innovation - NSF Strategic Plan for Fiscal Years (FY) 2018 – 2022. These strategies are integrated in the program planning and implementation process, of which proposal review is one part. NSF's mission is particularly well-implemented through the integration of research and education and broadening participation in NSF programs, projects, and activities.
One of the strategic objectives in support of NSF's mission is to foster integration of research and education through the programs, projects, and activities it supports at academic and research institutions. These institutions must recruit, train, and prepare a diverse STEM workforce to advance the frontiers of science and participate in the U.S. technology-based economy. NSF's contribution to the national innovation ecosystem is to provide cutting-edge research under the guidance of the Nation's most creative scientists and engineers. NSF also supports development of a strong science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce by investing in building the knowledge that informs improvements in STEM teaching and learning.
NSF's mission calls for the broadening of opportunities and expanding participation of groups, institutions, and geographic regions that are underrepresented in STEM disciplines, which is essential to the health and vitality of science and engineering. NSF is committed to this principle of diversity and deems it central to the programs, projects, and activities it considers and supports.
The National Science Foundation strives to invest in a robust and diverse portfolio of projects that creates new knowledge and enables breakthroughs in understanding across all areas of science and engineering research and education. To identify which projects to support, NSF relies on a merit review process that incorporates consideration of both the technical aspects of a proposed project and its potential to contribute more broadly to advancing NSF's mission ""to promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare; to secure the national defense; and for other purposes."" NSF makes every effort to conduct a fair, competitive, transparent merit review process for the selection of projects.
1. Merit Review Principles
These principles are to be given due diligence by PIs and organizations when preparing proposals and managing projects, by reviewers when reading and evaluating proposals, and by NSF program staff when determining whether or not to recommend proposals for funding and while overseeing awards. Given that NSF is the primary federal agency charged with nurturing and supporting excellence in basic research and education, the following three principles apply:
With respect to the third principle, even if assessment of Broader Impacts outcomes for particular projects is done at an aggregated level, PIs are expected to be accountable for carrying out the activities described in the funded project. Thus, individual projects should include clearly stated goals, specific descriptions of the activities that the PI intends to do, and a plan in place to document the outputs of those activities.
These three merit review principles provide the basis for the merit review criteria, as well as a context within which the users of the criteria can better understand their intent.
2. Merit Review Criteria
All NSF proposals are evaluated through use of the two National Science Board approved merit review criteria. In some instances, however, NSF will employ additional criteria as required to highlight the specific objectives of certain programs and activities.
The two merit review criteria are listed below. Both criteria are to be given full consideration during the review and decision-making processes; each criterion is necessary but neither, by itself, is sufficient. Therefore, proposers must fully address both criteria. (PAPPG Chapter II.C.2.d(i). contains additional information for use by proposers in development of the Project Description section of the proposal). Reviewers are strongly encouraged to review the criteria, including PAPPG Chapter II.C.2.d(i), prior to the review of a proposal.
When evaluating NSF proposals, reviewers will be asked to consider what the proposers want to do, why they want to do it, how they plan to do it, how they will know if they succeed, and what benefits could accrue if the project is successful. These issues apply both to the technical aspects of the proposal and the way in which the project may make broader contributions. To that end, reviewers will be asked to evaluate all proposals against two criteria:
The following elements should be considered in the review for both criteria:
Broader impacts may be accomplished through the research itself, through the activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project. NSF values the advancement of scientific knowledge and activities that contribute to achievement of societally relevant outcomes. Such outcomes include, but are not limited to: full participation of women, persons with disabilities, and underrepresented minorities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM); improved STEM education and educator development at any level; increased public scientific literacy and public engagement with science and technology; improved well-being of individuals in society; development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce; increased partnerships between academia, industry, and others; improved national security; increased economic competitiveness of the United States; and enhanced infrastructure for research and education.
Proposers are reminded that reviewers will also be asked to review the Data Management Plan and the Postdoctoral Researcher Mentoring Plan, as appropriate.
Additional Solicitation Specific Review Criteria
Proposals submitted in response to this program solicitation will be reviewed by Ad hoc Review and/or Panel Review, or Site Visit Review.
Ad hoc, panel, and site visit.
Reviewers will be asked to evaluate proposals using two National Science Board approved merit review criteria and, if applicable, additional program specific criteria. A summary rating and accompanying narrative will generally be completed and submitted by each reviewer and/or panel. The Program Officer assigned to manage the proposal's review will consider the advice of reviewers and will formulate a recommendation.
In order to coordinate funding actions among various agencies considering similar proposals, NSF may, at the point of decision, share information about the existence and general content of proposals with Federal agencies with which it has a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU). If another Federal agency is willing to consider co-funding proposals, NSF may also share proposals and review content with and/or may invite Federal employees of that agency to attend review panels as observers for the purpose of determining whether the agency may provide funding.
After scientific, technical and programmatic review and consideration of appropriate factors, the NSF Program Officer recommends to the cognizant Division Director whether the proposal should be declined or recommended for award. NSF strives to be able to tell applicants whether their proposals have been declined or recommended for funding within six months. Large or particularly complex proposals or proposals from new awardees may require additional review and processing time. The time interval begins on the deadline or target date, or receipt date, whichever is later. The interval ends when the Division Director acts upon the Program Officer's recommendation.
After programmatic approval has been obtained, the proposals recommended for funding will be forwarded to the Division of Grants and Agreements for review of business, financial, and policy implications. After an administrative review has occurred, Grants and Agreements Officers perform the processing and issuance of a grant or other agreement. Proposers are cautioned that only a Grants and Agreements Officer may make commitments, obligations or awards on behalf of NSF or authorize the expenditure of funds. No commitment on the part of NSF should be inferred from technical or budgetary discussions with a NSF Program Officer. A Principal Investigator or organization that makes financial or personnel commitments in the absence of a grant or cooperative agreement signed by the NSF Grants and Agreements Officer does so at their own risk.
Once an award or declination decision has been made, Principal Investigators are provided feedback about their proposals. In all cases, reviews are treated as confidential documents. Verbatim copies of reviews, excluding the names of the reviewers or any reviewer-identifying information, are sent to the Principal Investigator/Project Director by the Program Officer. In addition, the proposer will receive an explanation of the decision to award or decline funding.
Notification of the award is made to the submitting organization by a Grants Officer in the Division of Grants and Agreements. Organizations whose proposals are declined will be advised as promptly as possible by the cognizant NSF Program administering the program. Verbatim copies of reviews, not including the identity of the reviewer, will be provided automatically to the Principal Investigator. (See Section VI.B. for additional information on the review process.)
An NSF award consists of: (1) the award notice, which includes any special provisions applicable to the award and any numbered amendments thereto; (2) the budget, which indicates the amounts, by categories of expense, on which NSF has based its support (or otherwise communicates any specific approvals or disapprovals of proposed expenditures); (3) the proposal referenced in the award notice; (4) the applicable award conditions, such as Grant General Conditions (GC-1)*; or Research Terms and Conditions* and (5) any announcement or other NSF issuance that may be incorporated by reference in the award notice. Cooperative agreements also are administered in accordance with NSF Cooperative Agreement Financial and Administrative Terms and Conditions (CA-FATC) and the applicable Programmatic Terms and Conditions. NSF awards are electronically signed by an NSF Grants and Agreements Officer and transmitted electronically to the organization via e-mail.

Special Award Conditions:
Principles for the Conduct of Research in the Arctic
Principal Investigators are expected to follow the Principles for Conducting Research in the Arctic, prepared by the Social Science Task Force of the U.S. Interagency Arctic Research Policy Committee (IARPC), approved by IARPC in 1990, and revised in 2018. Investigators may find useful the Guidelines for Improved Cooperation between Arctic Researchers and Northern Communities.
Data Management Policy
Proposals submitted under this solicitation are required to include a Data Management Plan compliant with the Office of Polar Programs Data Management Policy (NSF 16-055). This policy establishes requirements for the archiving of metadata and data in long-lived and publicly accessible, unrestricted archives. Questions concerning this policy should be directed to the cognizant Program Officer in the Arctic Sciences Section.
Policies Related to Arctic Fieldwork
Participants in NSF-sponsored Arctic fieldwork are required to comply with the following NSF policies: Code of Conduct, Field Safety Risk Management, Physical Qualifications for Arctic Fieldwork, and IT Security Rules of Behavior. Failure to comply can result in removal from the field or from NSF facilities, retraction of funding, debarment, and referral to law enforcement as appropriate. These policies are available on the Arctic Research Support and Logistics program website (https://www.nsf.gov/geo/opp/arctic/res_log_sup.jsp) and the NSF prime Arctic logistics contractor website (https://battellearcticgateway.org/for-researchers).
Acknowledgement of Support
Grantees will be required to include appropriate acknowledgment of NSF support under the Arctic Sciences Section in any publication (including World Wide Web pages) of any material based on or developed under the project, in the following terms:
“This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation Arctic Sciences Section under Grant No. (Grantee enters NSF grant number.)""
Grantees also will be required to orally acknowledge NSF support using the language specified above during all news media interviews, including popular media such as radio, television, and news magazines.
For all multi-year grants (including both standard and continuing grants), the Principal Investigator must submit an annual project report to the cognizant Program Officer no later than 90 days prior to the end of the current budget period. (Some programs or awards require submission of more frequent project reports). No later than 120 days following expiration of a grant, the PI also is required to submit a final project report, and a project outcomes report for the general public.
Failure to provide the required annual or final project reports, or the project outcomes report, will delay NSF review and processing of any future funding increments as well as any pending proposals for all identified PIs and co-PIs on a given award. PIs should examine the formats of the required reports in advance to assure availability of required data.
PIs are required to use NSF's electronic project-reporting system, available through Research.gov, for preparation and submission of annual and final project reports. Such reports provide information on accomplishments, project participants (individual and organizational), publications, and other specific products and impacts of the project. Submission of the report via Research.gov constitutes certification by the PI that the contents of the report are accurate and complete. The project outcomes report also must be prepared and submitted using Research.gov. This report serves as a brief summary, prepared specifically for the public, of the nature and outcomes of the project. This report will be posted on the NSF website exactly as it is submitted by the PI.
More comprehensive information on NSF Reporting Requirements and other important information on the administration of NSF awards is contained in the NSF Proposal & Award Policies & Procedures Guide (PAPPG) Chapter VII, available electronically on the NSF Website at https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=pappg.
PIs are required to include in the final project report permanent digital identifiers, such as digital object identifiers (DOIs) and/or other URL links, to all metadata and archived data products resulting from the award. Those links must be provided in the “products” section of the final report.

It seeks insights into the following questions:
- What is the role of the Arctic in the global climate and the geopolitics of a warming Arctic?
- How can we situate climate-altering approaches, including large-scale Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) and proposed Solar Radiation Modification (SRM) technologies in such a context, and why governance is important?
- What approaches may (and may not) be relevant to the Arctic environment and if ever used, how might they effect both the Arctic and its environment, and the global climate?
- How might the physical and political context of the Arctic effect the capacity to efficiently and effectively undertake CDR or SRM in the region?
- What are the key governance issues, challenges and implications of undertaking research into, and the potential deployment of these approaches?
- How might some of the governance challenges be considered or addressed in the current Arctic governance processes and mechanisms?
Webinars
This Webinar will feature three ten-minute expert overviews on the climate-altering approaches in the Arctic. It will be followed by a forty-five minute moderated Q&A session, during which audience members will be invited to submit written questions via the Zoom chat. Speakers include:

From field and laboratory work to airborne campaigns and satellites, NASA is studying why boreal forest and tundra fires have become more frequent and powerful and what that means for climate forecasting, ecosystems and human health.
“Fires are a natural part of the ecosystem, but what we’re seeing is an accelerated fire cycle: we are getting more frequent and severe fires and larger burned areas,” said Liz Hoy, a boreal fire researcher at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. Hoy works with NASA’s Arctic-Boreal Vulnerability Experiment (ABoVE), a comprehensive field campaign that probes the resilience of Arctic and boreal ecosystems and societies to environmental change.
Arctic wildfires differ from mid-latitude fires, such as those in California and Idaho. For one, fires in the lower 48 are often set by humans and are put out as fast as possible, since they are a risk to life and property. In the boreal forest and tundra, wildfires are mostly ignited by lightning strikes and are usually left to burn unless they threaten important infrastructures or human settlements. As a result, they often grow large and consume hundreds of thousands of acres of vegetation.
Also unlike lower-latitude wildfires, most of the carbon emissions from Arctic fires come from burned organic soil rather than burned trees and shrubs.
“Arctic and boreal regions have very thick soils with a lot of organic material – because the soil is frozen or otherwise temperature-limited as well as nutrient-poor, its contents don’t decompose much,” Hoy said.
The thick, carbon-rich top soil layer of boreal forests and tundra acts as insulation for the permafrost, the perpetually frozen layer of ground underneath the surface organic mat.
“When you burn the soil on top it’s as if you had a cooler and you opened the lid: the permafrost underneath thaws and you’re allowing the soil to decompose and decay, so you’re releasing even more carbon into the atmosphere,” Hoy said.
A recent ABoVE study found that a single fire season in Canada emitted so much carbon into the atmosphere that it offset half of all the carbon removed from the atmosphere through annual tree growth across all of Canada’s vast forests. So not only are wildfires in the Arctic impacted by global warming, which is leading to warmer and drier summers that create dry, tinder-box conditions – they are also in turn contributing to more climate change.
“I sometimes hear ‘there aren’t that many people up there in the Arctic, so why can’t we just let it burn, why does it matter?’” Hoy said. “But what happens in the Arctic doesn’t stay in the Arctic – there are global connections to the changes taking place there.”
Changing Landscapes
The fire-driven thawing of permafrost causes land subsidence and soil collapse, creating a honeycombed landscape. In some places, new lakes form. In others, the resulting hollowed topography, known as thermokarst, dries up the landscape.
“Whether the fire-disturbed area will recover or go forward toward subsidence depends on how much ground ice is underlaying in the ground,” said Go Iwahana, a permafrost researcher at University of Alaska, Fairbanks, who works with ABoVE. “Other factors at play are how severely the fire wounds the surface organic layer and the weather the burned area experiences after the fire.”
Beyond altering landscapes that had been unperturbed for thousands of years, the disappearance of permafrost also means the irreparable loss of a historic record.
“As with ice cores in Antarctica and Greenland, we look at changes in water isotopes, gas content, and the ice structure of permafrost to understand what happened in the past,” Iwahana said. “Modelers and fire specialists are predicting an increased number of boreal and tundra fires in the future – this will enhance the thawing of permafrost, and so the paleoinformation contained in the permafrost will be lost.”
Changes to hydrological processes, together with how fire modifies the distribution of plant species, ultimately alter local ecosystems.
“After an intense fire, we can see changes in the overall vegetation composition of the land,” Hoy said. “It’s going to change the mammal species that are able to live there and how people can use the land, for example, for hunting.”
Two main game species in Alaska, caribou and moose, react very differently to burned landscapes. During the first decades after a large fire, moose herds move in to the area in pursuit of the young vegetation that grows back. But caribou, whose diets are very dependent on slow-growing surface lichens that take a very long time to recover, are harmed by fires.
“One of the major concerns in terms of wildlife management is that fires might restrict the range of the caribou,” said Alison York, coordinator of the Alaska Fire Science Consortium at University of Alaska.
Impacts on Health
Wildfires release large amounts of particulate matter, which are harmful to the respiratory and cardiovascular systems and can travel far and wide by winds.
“We hear a lot about the impacts of fires on health, but all those studies come from research coming from a single, generally short fire event,” said Tatiana Loboda, a professor at University of Maryland, College Park. “In the boreal forest region, fires are very common, very large and they produce a lot of smoke. Even people who don’t live nearby are exposed for a substantial period of time year after year.”
Loboda recently launched a project through ABoVE to study how exposure to particulates from forest fires is impacting the health of people in Alaska, a state that has issued over 30 air quality advisories during this year’s fire season alone. Though Loboda’s study is limited to Alaska, wildfires impact public health around the planet.
“Fires happen during the warm months, when people spend a lot of time outdoors -- especially indigenous people doing subsistence activities like fishing and hunting,” said Loboda, who plans on comparing the exposure of native communities to wildfires with health outcomes. “They lack any kind of protection they would get by being indoors with the A/C on and closing their windows.”
For her study, Loboda will use hospitalization records from Alaska’s Department of Public Health to analyze how many people get ill during the fire season. She’ll also analyze NASA satellite data that, combined with computer models, will allow her to create a detailed record of burning at the daily scale, as well as thorough inventories of fuel types – the kind of greenery that burns combined with the intensity of the fire determines how much particulates are created.
“In the last 20 years we’ve had the three largest fire seasons on record for Alaska and that’s happening at the same time that the population is growing,” Loboda said. “The more people are spread out, the more likelihood someone is going to be affected somewhere in any given year.”

Incorporated as a not-for-profit foundation in 1971, and headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, the Forum is tied to no political, partisan or national interests.","Most corporate boardrooms are not routinely focused on the Arctic. Making sense of changes in the Great White North is difficult (and seemingly unimportant) when you live far away and you’re not a scientist, or in charge of Arctic drilling. Yet research suggests that the loss of Arctic summer sea ice will seriously affect ecosystems, societies – and economies globally.
The final price tag is still unknown but potentially in the range of tens of trillions of US dollars. What we do know is that Arctic feedbacks will make the effects of climate change worse, all around the globe. These economic consequences will be widely but unevenly distributed – integrated assessment modelling shows that 80% of economic impacts from climate change will be borne by developing countries, because of more extreme weather, flooding, extreme heat stress, droughts, storms and poorer health.
Increased oil, gas and mineral extraction and the opening up of new shipping routes (which may reduce transport expenses for goods) are all economically attractive to businesses. But a balanced economic scorecard must consider industry sectors that face economic risks from Arctic change.
Here we consider three industries that arguably could be hard hit by the loss of Arctic sea ice.
- The agriculture sector and Arctic risks to food security
Agriculture accounts for roughly 3% of the world’s GDP (higher in developing countries) and is one of the most vulnerable industries to climate change. While the Arctic region remains too cold to grow crops, the loss of summer sea ice has the power to significantly affect crop yields elsewhere. For example, a rapid ice melt can accelerate droughts, heatwaves and flooding to a faster pace than most agribusiness can adapt to.
This chart shows the production of the four most important staple foods, maize (corn), rice, wheat and potatoes, between 1961 and 2013:
Source: FAOSTAT
Global production figures over the past 50 years are impressive. Yet study after study shows that staples – as well as many other crops – are increasingly vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Changing rain and snowfall patterns, increasing temperatures and more extreme weather events will seriously shake up the agricultural industry in the US, China, southern Europe and sub-Saharan Africa.
Of course, there are winners and losers, at least in the short term. While British wine-makers may rejoice at their newfound ability to compete with French sparkling wines, studies warn that businesses that “rely on agricultural exports for relatively large shares of their income may be vulnerable not only to direct climate-induced agricultural damages, but also to positive impacts induced by greenhouse gas emissions elsewhere”.
The bottom line: CEOs of Unilever, Nestlé, Cargill and Monsanto should pay – and increasingly are paying – more attention to the state of the northern ice caps. A melting Arctic poses serious risks to global food security.
2. The insurance sector and Arctic risk
In 2012, Lloyd’s of London warned that an oil spill in the Arctic was “a unique and hard” risk to mitigate, because of the complex and fragile ecosystem. Yet the insurance industry could be hard hit by Arctic change in more ways than one. Sure, insurers can anticipate increased risks for assets located within the Arctic – but also face risks to assets elsewhere that may be affected by Arctic change.
Take, for instance, the potential link between Arctic summer sea ice and extreme weather events such as Superstorm Sandy or the deep freeze of the Polar Vortex in Canada and the US. While answers are not yet definitive, Jennifer Francis from Rutgers University argues that the warming Arctic may be altering the jetstream, which can influence the size, duration and location of major storms, and allow Arctic temperatures to expand beyond its borders. “As the Arctic sea-ice cover continues to disappear and the snow cover melts ever earlier over vast regions of Eurasia and North America … it is expected that large-scale circulation patterns throughout the northern hemisphere will become increasingly influenced by Arctic amplification.”
If the science is correct, Arctic change may ramp up extreme weather events, leading to growing insurance risks. Munich Re, the reinsurance giant, estimated that the unseasonable cold from the 2014 Polar Vortex led to $2.4 billion in insurance losses. And 70% of the costliest natural disasters since 1980 have been storms or droughts. Scientific research demonstrates that global warming, amplified by the loss of Arctic summer sea ice, will increase the likelihood and severity of these kinds of events.

Back to the current state of play, satellite data shows that the 2015 Arctic melt season is consistent with a long-term and worrisome downward trend in the sea ice – a trend that may leave the insurance sector out in the cold.
3. Tourism
The tourist industry relies on stable weather conditions, with tourists often planning vacations months in advance. A warming climate will reduce snowfall in the winter months, damaging the business of ski resorts, and cause other areas to become too hot in summers.
If we consider only the northern hemisphere, a recent EU study (ToPDAd) from Cambridge University suggests that even without Arctic amplification, there will be more than a 5% decrease in overnight stays in the warmest Mediterranean countries by 2050, countries that rely critically on tourism to support their GDP. Arctic amplification will draw that date closer, and increase the loss of tourism. Admittedly, people might shift their summer vacations further north, but that will be a shift that makes the current disparity in GDP between the northern and southern EU nations even larger, potentially collapsing the Eurozone.
This chart shows the shift of summer overnight stays in beach-dominated regions, with effects on local tourist businesses. The values in colour are the percentage decline (red) or increase (green) in parts of the EU.
And there’s more to come
While some industries can benefit from Arctic change (e.g. extraction and potentially shipping), others such as agriculture, insurance and tourism face steep economic risks.
A balanced Arctic economic scorecard must consider both the benefits and costs of Arctic change, including the possibility of investments going sour. Assets (such as those from Arctic drilling) can become stranded and worthless when future climate effects become so evident that new policies cause fossil fuels to be left in the ground. And that would be a good thing for agriculture, insurance and tourism.
This blog is part of a four-part series in which we discuss how Arctic summer sea ice affects our global economy, our lifestyles and the Earth’s ecosystem. We also sketch out reasons to be hopeful.

The Arctic Frontiers 2021 – Building Bridges Plenary program has brought together decision makers, indigenous leaders, business and youth representative to discuss the most pressing issues facing the Arctic. During the conference and now on our platform we present an exciting series of hosted in-person and on-line session the five thematic sessions: Building the Future, Ocean meets Coast, Arctic Health and Wellness, Business Solutions, and Building Bridges.
See the detailed program for Arctic Frontiers 2021 here
Welcome to Arctic Frontiers 2021 – Building Bridges.
The title Building Bridges is recognition of the strength that is gained by safeguarding the Arctic as a region of peace and global example of cooperation in an age of growing tensions and world-wide uncertainty. It also represents the need for open, honest discussions on difficult topics to ensure that polarization of positions do not create further isolation for societies and degradation of business opportunities.
Our plenary sessions not only explores important connections within the Arctic, but also complicated connections with political, economic and natural forces outside the region that have a profound effect on the Arctic and the other way around. How can innovation and concrete collaboration lead to practical solutions for resilient Arctic societies now and in the future? Our objective this year is to create a conference that puts these questions at the forefront.
Wellbeing and Societal Health
The Arctic is a diverse and vibrant region of people who have lived there since time immemorial and also those who have chosen this beautiful region as home. Healthy Arctic societies are threatened by worrying levels of contamination, disruptions of food webs, mental illness and suicide. The COVID-19 pandemic poses additional obstacles for Arctic communities and businesses. Solutions are complex due to a myriad of challenges left by the vestiges of colonialism, including access to health care services and equipment, the need for reckoning over racial injustice, southern migration of young people and the masculine character of Arctic communities. This session seeks to shed light on the stories and strategies required to build bridges to healthier Arctic populations.
Building the Future
This year Arctic Frontiers hosted a panel of young Arctic leaders alongside seasoned Arctic influencers who dived deeper into the opportunities and obstacles northern youth face now and in the future. Framed in the context of the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals, speakers are invited to discuss the pressing issues they stand to inherit such as climate change, societal pressure, migration of young people to the south and the question of whether the Arctic is facing its own cultural revolution. This session seeks to build bridges between generations, borders and disciplines to find the best solutions for a resilient Arctic.
Ocean meets Coast
For centuries Arctic communities have turned to the seas to provide food, safe haven, transportation, natural resources and energy not just to survive, but to thrive. Once considered secondary, traditional activities are now the centrepiece of national policies and business since it is no secret that we need our oceans to meet growing demands for food, resources, transportation and energy. This reality is balanced by the urgent need to sustain healthy oceans to ensure a healthy planet. In this session we discussed the opportunities and challenges created by the rapid growth of ocean-based industry and the societies on the front lines, through the lens of cooperation and innovation.
Business Solutions
This thematic sessions looked at specific solutions to challenges facing Arctic businesses at the heart of northern communities. Unique competence and expertise remain challenged by capacity issues, under-capitalization and infrastructure challenges that limits commercialization and scaling for Arctic products and services. Arctic Frontiers 2021 closed with our final Building Bridges session hosted by Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg. Leaders discussed how the global economic downturn due to the COVID-19 pandemic had also been felt in the Arctic and provided insights into what recovery would look like for businesses that operate in the region. The second half of the discussion focused on shifting approaches to geopolitics North of 60.

The Arctic Semester takes place at DTU's campus in Sisimiut and is offered once a year in the spring semester. The Arctic Semester can be included in a number of DTU's master's programs and is also open to students from other universities.
The language of the education is English.
Extreme Engineering
- The Arctic Semester in Greenland
Why go all the way to Greenland? Because it is exciting and rewarding – both from a strictly learning point of view and from a life experience point of view.
Many places in the world engineers work under extreme conditions. It could be an extreme climate: very cold or hot, very humid or dry. It could be an extreme physical environment: rough mountains or soft ground. It could be extreme logistics: Isolated settlement without infrastructure or remote areas with difficult access.
Common for those conditions is that you work under abnormal conditions; you cannot use standard methods and procedures. You have to adapt to the extreme condition or develop new methods and procedures.
The Arctic Semester is an opportunity for you to experience the unique environment and the challenges of extreme engineering north of the Arctic Circle:
- How to design buildings able to withstand strong forces from heavy snow load and extreme gales, and how to design comfortable indoor climate in an energy efficient way in a harsh climate.
- How to construct on unstable permafrost or harbors in icy waters, and how to blast tunnels in old cracking rock for hydroelectric plants or mines.
- How to treat wastewater and solid waste in remote locations
- How to manage the logistics in remote areas with a sparsely population and very limited access.
Greenland has it all. If you can engineer in Greenland, you can engineer everywhere.

The agreement aims to reduce the environmental impact of unregulated commercial fishing in the Arctic high seas by banning trawling for 16 years.
The treaty has an automatic renewal clause every five years and was signed by Canada, China, Denmark, Iceland, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Norway, Russia and the USA in addition to the EU. It will enter into force once ratified by all ten parties.
An area of about 2.8 million square kilometres of the central Arctic high seas will be protected as a result, in order to try and “safeguard healthy marine ecosystems, ensuring the conservation of fish stocks and guarantee the sustainability of the fishing activities,” according to a statement from the European Parliament.
There is currently no commercial fishing taking place in this area because it was previously covered in ice. But as ocean conditions change, it will be possible for fishing vessels to enter these new areas in the future.
The Arctic is warming twice as fast as the rest of the world and this displacement is affecting the oceans and fish populations. The new deal is a precautionary approach to fisheries management, an EU source told EURACTIV.
It is the first time that the international community has refrained from commercial fishing in a particular area before more is known about its ecosystem.
Arctic nations bet on ‘blue economy’ to reconcile climate, development goals
From global warming to over- and illegal fishing, the ocean on which Arctic communities are so heavily dependent is under threat like never before, delegates heard at the Arctic conference in Tromsø, Norway.
“The Commission hopes that, from this Agreement, the parties will work together under the Joint Program of Scientific Research and Monitoring in order to improve the understanding of the ecosystems of this area and, in particular, of determining whether fish stocks might exist in this area that could be harvested on a sustainable basis,” the EU source said.
The EU estimates that about 15% of fishing is done illegally and without regulation, amounting to up to 26 million tonnes of fish each year.
Commercial fishing impact
EU fishing association Europêche welcomed the agreement and said its fishermen had already committed a few years ago not to commercially fish in this zone.
“Our operators support the efforts made by the international community to better understand this particular ecosystem and ensure the conservation and sustainable use of fish stocks in the area,” a Europêche source told EURACTIV.
Commercial fishing negatively impacts the ocean through overfishing, pollution from nets and equipment, and destruction from trawling and dredging. More than 30% of the world’s fisheries are being pushed beyond their limits and overfishing alters ecosystems.
Many fish stocks are on the verge of collapse as a result and regulations are sometimes necessary to keep the fishing industry sustainable.
Climatic conditions in the northern Arctic Ocean are changing fast and, despite its great economic potential, the future of fishing there is uncertain, the European Parliament said.

The 160,000 Inuit who live in northern Canada, Greenland, Alaska and Chukotka in Russia have witnessed the changing of the natural environment as a result of global warming for almost 20 years.
It is important that you know what climate change does and means to us, for what we are experiencing now will happen to the further South in a few short years. I live in Inuvik, well above the Arctic circle, on the Mackenzie River delta in Canada's northwest territories. About 4,000 people live in Inuvik -- the northern headquarters of oil and gas development in the Beaufort Sea region. The circumpolar Arctic is not isolated anymore; globalization has reached it. The South is hungry for our oil, gas and minerals, with exploration proceeding quickly in many parts of the Arctic. The United States Geological Survey believes that 25 per cent of the world's remaining oil and gas is located here. Northern Canada is the world's third largest producer of gem diamonds; great reserves of base and precious metals and coal have been found in the North. In the last 40 to 50 years, Inuit have adjusted to social, economic and cultural changes. But even as we adapt to globalization, we realize that climate moderation is likely to be the key driver of socio-economic and cultural changes in years ahead.
In 1999, the Winnipeg-based International Institute for Sustainable Development and the community of Sachs Harbour (with about 125 people), on Banks Island in the Beaufort Sea region, documented local and regional environmental changes. In a video shown at the 2000 Conference of the Parties (COP) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), hunters and elders spoke with quiet authority about: commonplace and cumulative changes; melting permafrost, resulting in beach slumping and lake erosions; increased snowfalls; longer sea ice-free seasons; emerging or invasive new species of birds, fish and insects (barn owls, mallard, pin-tailed ducks and salmon) near the community; a decline in the lemming population (a basic food for Arctic fox and a staple species); and a general warming trend.
These changes are not unique to my region. They are also reported by Inuit in Greenland and Alaska, Saami in northern Norway, Aleut in the Aleutian Islands, Athabaskans and Gwich'in in North America, Nenets, Chukchi and many other indigenous peoples in northern Russia. Our world is increasingly changing. The traditional knowledge of how the world works, passed down from generation to generation, is less accurate than it was. Climate change is not a theoretical faraway problem for future generations to solve. It is already happening in the Arctic, which is struggling to adjust and adapt to its impacts. Communities are contending with vanishing historical sites, gravesite erosions, and community disruption and relocation. Inuit are as adaptable as others, but only to a certain degree.
Our observations helped to persuade the eight Arctic States to launch the Arctic Climate Impact Assessment (ACIA) in 2000, involving more than 300 scientists from 15 countries, and assisted by Arctic indigenous peoples. The Assessment, published in 2005, was the centrepiece of the 2005 COP in Montreal. It significantly influenced the three summaries for policymakers, issued by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in 2007, on the physical science of climate change mitigation and impacts effects and vulnerabilities, which singled out the Arctic.
Ten years ago, hardly anyone talked about climate change in my part of the world; today, climate change stories worldwide feature polar bears, seals and Inuit. Scientists and politicians are beginning to read the Arctic barometer's message: stormy weather ahead. A key conclusion of the almost 1,000-page Assessment is the projected thawing and disappearance of multi-year sea ice in the summer by mid to end of the century. The Arctic Ocean will then share similarities with North America's Great Lakes -- freezing in winter (to some degree) and thawing in summer. Since ACIA was completed, science suggests that this may become the situation by 2040 or even earlier.
Let me focus on two of the many implications suggested by ACIA about a summer sea ice-free Arctic. First, marine mammals, including polar bears, walrus and seals, as well as species of marine birds that rely on sea ice as habitat, face potential ""extinction"". The Inuit culture and relationship are uniquely related to the Arctic ecosystem, and what happens to the species directly affects our fortitude. The UNFCCC aims to prevent ""dangerous"" climate change in order to ""ensure that food production is not threatened"". Well, the threat is already here in the Arctic. The Arctic Council is presently working on ice conditions scenarios in 2020 and 2050.
Second, far easier access, particularly by sea, will be available to the Arctic's minerals and hydrocarbons, many of which are located offshore. A significant increase in general cargo transits is projected through the northwest or northeast passages, or even the Arctic Ocean. In short, climate change will promote and accelerate industrial development in a unique, fragile and vulnerable region. It is not far-fetched to foresee shipping in the Arctic, linking Europe and Asia to the western and eastern seaboards of North America, cutting off thousands of kilometres of global sea routes, which will further impact our sensitive region.
The circumpolar Arctic may well become a region of considerable geopolitical and strategic importance. Some authors have predicted mass population movements as a result of climate change. This may be plausible in tropical and temperate regions, but it remains highly unlikely in the Arctic. Nevertheless, how will the region's indigenous populations fare in a future moulded by global climate change? Firm answers are not possible, but adaptation on a huge scale will be needed despite the risks involved. The culture of Inuit and other Arctic indigenous peoples is based on their relationship with the land, environment and animals. Wholesale adaptation to an industrial future may be tantamount to assimilation that indigenous peoples worldwide seek to avoid.
The methods in which adaptation is carried out will likely reflect the relationship between the Arctic indigenous peoples and their national governments. But whatever the future holds, Inuit and all Arctic indigenous peoples will press the global community to reduce emission of greenhouse gases that are the main cause of the impact of climate change we are experiencing throughout the circumpolar Arctic and foreseen areas.

Each year in the Antarctic winter, the extreme low temperatures create high altitude clouds, which combined with halogens (chemicals such as chlorine and bromine which come from refrigerants and other industrial sources), as well and sunlight, lead to a reduction in ozone in the South Pole. This is well-known and is why scientists monitor this depletion annually. Last year, for example, the Antarctic ozone hole was quite small (the smallest since records began in 1982) as temperatures in the low stratosphere above the Antarctic were higher than normal.
But the atmospheric conditions in the Arctic are different. In contrast to the Antarctic, temperatures as cold as Antarctic are rare in the Arctic. However, this year, scientists say, the extreme low temperatures in the North Pole trapped cold air in a ‘polar vortex’ within which high altitude clouds formed, catalyzing the ozone destroying reactions.
What can be expected now, is the normal seasonal temperature rise which will see the depletion diminish over the coming weeks. The unusually large depletion of the Arctic ozone layer was due to extraordinary atmospheric conditions. This year’s Arctic ozone depletion has been exceptional, rather than the norm.
Overall, scientists note a decline in halogens in the atmosphere and the start of ozone recovery, also confirmed by the recent study by Ananta Banerjee - A pause in Southern Hemisphere circulation trends due to the Montreal Protocol – featured in Nature and available on the Ozone Secretariat’s website Resources page.",,,,,2020-04-06,Ozone Secretariat

For a long time, many of us observing Arctic affairs have been using the term Rovaniemi Arctic spirit when we refer to Arctic international co-operation.[1] It aims to capture the sentiment that it is in this region that Arctic states can foster peace and international co-operation, even if there are tensions between their overall relations. This spirit is now in danger, and I will explain why. As a scholar who has studied the Arctic international co-operation from the mid-1990s, we have now reached a stage where we need to have serious discussions about what is happening in the region – are we losing the Rovaniemi Arctic spirit, and, if so, in what way?

My own experience stems from the Finnish chairmanship of the Arctic Council between 2017 and 2019. Not only did I play multiple roles in implementing that chairmanship, but also I interviewed all the key civil servants and diplomats who were in charge of various aspects of the Finnish chairmanship.
We prepared our chairmanship programme during the United States chairmanship (2015-2017), which was presented already at the Portland Senior Arctic Official meeting (October 2016). Our chairmanship programme very much reflected the ambitious Obama-era priorities of the US chairmanship: along with other goals, we expressed our willingness to implement the Paris climate agreement and the UN Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs) via the Arctic Council. Yet, the first challenge was already around the corner. It was not Hillary Clinton who was elected as the President of the United States, but Donald Trump, whose priorities were diametrically opposed to those of the Obama administration. Trump had openly undermined both the Paris climate agreement and multilateral frameworks in general in his campaign.
So, when the Fairbanks ministerial meeting of 11 May 2017 drew near, we found ourselves in a very tricky situation: our chairmanship programme was built on those multilateral frameworks that the Trump administration was thought to oppose. And this did manifest itself in the Fairbanks ministerial meeting. When we, in the Finnish delegation, made our way to Fairbanks, we heard that the then Secretary of State Rex Tillerson had challenged the Fairbanks declaration. This caused a lot of uproar, and diplomats from all the other seven Arctic Council member states were busy trying to convince Tillerson and his aides that the declaration is acceptable. Finally, Tillerson did accept the declaration, and it was ultimately signed, but he did mention in the final plenary that the Trump administration had not yet made up its mind about whether or not to stay in the Paris climate agreement.[2] The good side, from the viewpoint of the Finns, was this: we could commence our chairmanship programme with our stated priorities.
The initial stages of the chairmanship were fairly problem-free but gradually the imprint of the Trump administration started to manifest itself. The US had a very ambitious Arctic Council chairmanship 2015-2017 and had, for example, commenced two initiatives to make the Council a more ambitious and strategic forum: to establish a Marine Commission within the Arctic Council to consolidate the marine policy of the Arctic waters and to adopt the first ever long-term strategy for the Council. Finland, hence, was tasked with completing these projects as the next chair, but unfortunately was unable to finalise either. The United States, which commenced the Marine Commission work, was also one country that was now against establishing the Commission. The long-term strategy work continued until the final stages of Finland’s chairmanship, but there were several reasons why it could not be adopted. Sadly, one of these reasons was that we did not want to have a first-ever long-term strategy for the Council that would not mention climate change.
Finland was also leading the expert group on black carbon and methane, which became a visible activity during our chairmanship, given that our President was actively discussing the issue of black carbon with both Presidents Putin and Trump. Unfortunately, by the end of the work, the US did not accept anymore the collective goal that was agreed in the Fairbanks declaration for black carbon reduction: 25-33% reduction by 2025 from their 2013 emission levels. Furthermore, the US did not perceive the work in this expert group as climate change mitigation but as related to curtailing air pollution, and was generally against referring to multilateral frameworks in this work. Russia, on its part, had difficulties in delivering information to the expert group.
In my own work as the chair of Social, Economic and Cultural Expert Group, an expert group under the Arctic Council’s Sustainable Development Working Group (SDWG), the problem turned out to be the UN SDGs. When I presented our work to the SDWG, at first the US representative said that I can talk of UN SDGs in general, but not of the individual goals of the UN SDGs. Then, in the February 2019 SDWG meeting, the US representative asked me not to refer anymore to the UN SDGs at all.
Hence, when the Rovaniemi ministerial meeting approached, most of us knew that the Trump administration’s values and priorities had started to influence the work of the Arctic Council, but it is also equally clear that we could not foresee what was ahead of us. The US challenge to the work of the Arctic Council had been visible but it was not systematic. Most work in the Council was still going forward relatively well.
Rovaniemi Ministerial Meeting
There were many problems that Finland’s chairmanship faced during the Rovaniemi ministerial meeting ending the Finnish chairmanship. The preparation of the declaration, as usual, was commenced much before the ministerial meeting. During the weekend before the ministerial (6-7 May 2019), the Senior Arctic Officials (SAOs) were able to remove most of the bracketed sentences, and by Sunday, 5 May 2019, the declaration was acceptable to all the eight Arctic states.
Yet, gradually over that weekend, the US delegation leadership was overtaken by high-level officials from the US State Department. For this reason, few hours after the declaration had been accepted, the US informed that it no longer consents to the declaration, and it proposed its own draft for a declaration, which lacked any references to climate change. This was a vast surprise to other delegations, given that much of the Arctic Council’s work deals directly or indirectly with climate change, and the other states signalled their disapproval of the US proposal. On Monday, the foreign ministers convened in the Arktikum building in Rovaniemi for a dinner, which was the final opportunity for Finland to bridge these two opposing views. Yet, the US was adamant in not having climate change mentioned in the declaration, and the other delegations were equally clear that climate change needs to be mentioned. Hence, Finnish diplomats needed to acknowledge that, realistically, no signed declaration can be achieved.
This started a busy period of coming up with a solution on how to save the Rovaniemi ministerial meeting and continue the work of the Arctic Council. Finland’s solution was based on the already existing declaration and was two-fold: signing a joint statement by all the eight Arctic states, which welcomed the Icelandic chairmanship and its chairmanship programme, and a statement by the chair (foreign minister of Finland) as to what was agreed in the meeting and what was not. Yet, this was not the end of the challenge from the US viewpoint. The US delegation was also not ready to adopt the SAO report as it contained a lot of references to climate change, and it asked Finland to remove it from the agenda of the plenary. Why is this report so important? It contained the working plans of all six working-groups of the Arctic Council and also the budget of the Council secretariat. Finland took a conscious risk and placed it on the agenda of the ministerial meeting, just before the signing of the joint ministerial statement, thinking that the US would not dare to challenge the consensus. This strategy proved successful, and the US did not object to the SAO report in the plenary of the ministerial.
These events lead to serious questions. Was there a real challenge to the further functioning of the Arctic Council? No. The US did welcome the short signed ministerial statement, in which the Icelandic chairmanship and chairmanship programme were approved. Yet, it did object to the acceptance of the SAO report, which was meant to guarantee the continuation of work-plans of the working-groups and secure the budget for the Arctic Council secretariat. This was a real challenge since no one was able to tell at the time how we could continue the work of the working-groups, as normally these are authorised by a signed declaration (but now they were not). This needs to be kept in mind, even if ultimately the SAO report was accepted.
Why did the ministerial meeting then become such a dramatic event? As I already mentioned, there were some signs of Trump administration priorities starting to influence the views and behaviour of few US officials during the Finnish chairmanship. Yet, clearly the bigger challenge came from the fact that the US delegation leadership changed just before the ministerial, which then led to greater challenges in the ministerial meeting. It did seem that this new leadership was not much aware of what the Arctic Council does, which then, in part, led to significant problems in keeping the Arctic Council going.
Threats to Arctic Governance aired out during the Rovaniemi Ministerial Meeting
Surprisingly, the Secretary of State Mike Pompeo wanted to give an unscheduled presentation on 6 May, just before the actual ministerial meeting in the same hockey arena where the ministerial meeting would take place the next day. I think most of us who were invited to hear this speech were also surprised about its aggressive tone. Pompeo aired out the Trump administration’s concerns towards both China and Russia. He perceived that China’s behaviour needs to be carefully monitored because, according to him, China will likely be as dubious an actor in the Arctic as it has been elsewhere. He also argued that China is already a military threat in the Arctic and will only be more so in the future. For Pompeo, Russia also poses a threat, given that it has militarised its Arctic regions and has enacted an illegal decree to impede navigation along the Northern Sea Route. The tone of his speech was aggressive, and he advanced the Arctic not as a place for peaceful co-operation but one of strategic competition. These views have been confirmed by the then national security adviser Bolton and President Trump himself.
What is the Future of the Arctic Council and Arctic Governance?
What is then left of the Rovaniemi Arctic spirit that we have been able to celebrate from the time after the end of the Cold War up until now?
What will happen with the Arctic Council? Perhaps it can continue as before, now that all the important documents have been adopted by the Rovaniemi ministerial. The first signs from the Icelandic chairmanship are bright, things are moving well, but so they were even at the beginning of the Finnish chairmanship. Yet, now that we know that US officials were implementing the Trump agenda during the Finnish chairmanship and that the US did not accept climate change even mentioned during the ministerial meeting, it is difficult to maintain that nothing has changed (at least until the end of Trump presidency). It is a fact that the Trump administration is against exactly those climate change and multilateral frameworks that are at the core of how the Arctic Council functions.
What will be important is who will be nominated as the next SAO of the US, as currently there is an interim SAO. It is not even sure that a regular SAO will be nominated, but if this does take place and if this person is close to Trump administration (as one can suspect), this nomination would have a wider impact on the functioning of the Arctic Council. This is because it is the SAOs that co-ordinate all the work within the Arctic Council.
It is also important to highlight the importance of the results of the next Presidential elections in the US in November 2020. If a Democrat wins, it is likely that the functioning of the Arctic Council will be restored to normal, indicating how much the current challenge to the Arctic Council and Arctic governance is related to Trump himself. If Trump wins the re-election, it seems quite likely that the Council will also change. It is difficult to foresee that if Trump gets another 4 years continuation for his Presidency, climate change work in the Arctic Council could continue. In this scenario, it is more likely that the Council gradually focuses more on traditional environmental protection and sustainable development, with a heavy tilt towards advancing economic opportunities in the region. What will then happen with the climate change work of the Council? It is my belief that this will continue in other international co-operation forums that are plentiful in the Arctic, science and university organisations but also in other intergovernmental forums where the US is not a member, such as the Nordic Council or the Barents Euro-Arctic Council. I do think that, in this scenario, other Arctic Council member states would see it more important to continue Council co-operation than pulling out of it because of obstacles to continue climate change work.
What about the future direction of Arctic international governance in general? – after all, the Arctic Council is only part and parcel of the larger governance framework of the region. For long, we have been defining the Arctic as an exceptional area, a region to which the general tensions of the major powers will mostly not extend. This has been a longstanding policy of all Arctic states – to keep the Arctic outside these tensions and build collaborative structures to advance sustainable development in the region. A good example of this is the Ukraine controversy and conflict. All the other Arctic Council member states participated in sanctions against Russia, and Russia counter-sanctioned. Yet, this did not prevent the Arctic and other actors from building further international co-operation – the Arctic Council functioned fine, and produced a new legally binding agreement on scientific co-operation in 2017; the Polar Code entered force in 2017; and the Central Arctic Ocean Fisheries agreement was signed in 2018.
Yet, now we have an Arctic Council member state, USA, which openly challenges Russia and wants to fight its global “war” with China also in the Arctic. The US also denies the existence of climate change, even if it clearly is the biggest threat to the future of the Arctic and forms a main part of the work that the Arctic collaborative arrangements focus on. It is because of this change in the geopolitical situation that, at the last Arctic Circle, the Prime Ministers of Finland and Iceland were discussing whether we should include hard security issues in the agenda of the Arctic Council – and at least the Icelandic premier seemed to be of that opinion. The US tries to portray the Arctic as a place for strategic competition, which works against the image most of us have had of the region – that of being a place for peace and international co-operation. Mostly the US has moved forward with heavy words, rather than actions, and we have to see how serious the Trump administration is in its Arctic actions. But words also matter. The world’s only superpower can create realities simply by re-stating what is happening in the Arctic, in its own view, however wrongly it would capture the reality of the region. If this were to become the perceived reality of the region, we may still have international cooperation and the Arctic Council functioning in the region, but their importance would diminish.
Concluding Note
It is, hence, difficult to conclude in any other way than to say that there are grave uncertainties as to how the Arctic Council and Arctic international governance in general will develop. We know that the Arctic Council and Arctic governance will continue to face serious challenges as long as Trump remains the President of the United States. The framework of Arctic governance will be put into a test of resilience – how can climate change work continue when the US does not even want to have that term in a declaration, or wants to portray the region as a place for strategic competition? Will we, 10 years from now, recall that it was the Rovaniemi Arctic Council ministerial meeting where we lost the Rovaniemi Arctic spirit that was triggered in that very same town. Those of us who deeply care about the Arctic Council and the future of the Arctic should be aware of what is happening and should do our utmost to speak for the values the Arctic Council represents.

Our Story
Founded in 1977 by the late Eben Hopson of Barrow, Alaska, the Inuit Circumpolar Council (ICC) has flourished and grown into a major international non-government organization representing approximately 180,000 Inuit of Alaska, Canada, Greenland, and Chukotka (Russia). The organization holds Consultative Status II at the United Nations.
To thrive in their circumpolar homeland, Inuit had the vision to realize they must speak with a united voice on issues of common concern and combine their energies and talents towards protecting and promoting their way of life. The principal goals of ICC are, therefore, to strengthen unity among Inuit of the circumpolar region; promote Inuit rights and interests on an international level; develop and encourage long-term policies that safeguard the Arctic environment; and seek full and active partnership in the political, economic, and social development of circumpolar regions.
ICC holds a General Assembly every four years at which delegates from across the circumpolar region elect a new Chair and an executive council, develop policies, and adopt resolutions that will guide the activities of the organization for the coming term. The General Assembly is the heart of the organization, providing an opportunity for sharing information, discussing common concerns, debating issues, and strengthening the bonds between all Inuit. Representatives from the Inuit Circumpolar Youth Council and the International Elders Council attend, thereby improving communications and creating synergies with these important affiliated organizations.
In 2006 at the ICC General Assembly, held in Barrow, Alaska, ICC was instructed to “annually proclaim November 7th, the birth date of ICC visionary, Eben Hopson, Sr., as Inuit Day, and to urge all Inuit governments, agencies, and communities to annually proclaim this day as Inuit Day, and conduct appropriate ceremonies and celebrations.”",,,,,2018-12-17,Inuit Circumpolar Council Canada

The Race for Arctic Domination
Note: see full-sized infographic for more legibility.
In the year 1776, James Cook was dispatched from Great Britain on an important mission: to discover the Northwest Passage. The famed hypothetical route from the Pacific to the Atlantic was a primary motivation for many British expeditions to the New World. Such a route would expedite trade between Europe and Asia, creating wealth for the kingdoms and merchants that could navigate it. The British government tried to motivate explorers even more by putting into law that there would be a prize of £20,000 for whoever could make such a discovery.
After spending some time in Hawaii, Cook came at it from the Pacific side. He and his crew searched northwards along the long coast of British Columbia, and eventually made his way in between Alaska and Russia through the Bering Strait. Seeing nothing but icebergs, it became clear that there was no navigable passage that could be seen.
For close to 300 years, explorers had searched for such a route, but ice and cold made it ultimately impossible for the technology of the day. Even Robert McClure, who was credited with the discovery of the Passage, got stuck in ice for three winters near Banks Island and had to be rescued.
Today, these routes through Northern waters have regained importance. Over recent decades, ice has thawed in the Arctic and 2008 became the first year that both the Northeast Passage (North of Russia) and the Northwest Passage (North of Canada) were open to ships simultaneously. This means it may be the first time that a vessel could theoretically circumnavigate the North Pole in 125,000 years.
Not surprisingly, countries such as Russia, Canada, Norway, Denmark, and the United States have taken notice and are posturing accordingly. The thawing waterways of the Arctic are the potential home to shipping routes, natural resources, and other territorial claims. For example, the US Geological Service estimates that the Arctic is home to 13% of the world’s undiscovered oil, as well as 30% of its undiscovered natural gas.
However, nation-states are not the only group engaged in this Battle Royale. Environmentalists have also entered the ring, and they’ve already helped to deliver a solid takedown. In September 2015, Royal Dutch Shell announced that they would abandon their Arctic drilling campaign even after spending $7 billion on the well. Realistically, there were several reasons for the change of plans, but traction on behalf of environmentalists definitely played a key role.
While some experts are referring to this as a new Cold War (pun likely intended), the conquest for Arctic domination is certainly heating up.

Development, economic activity and investment within the Arctic region is intensifying. As the sea ice in the Arctic Ocean retreats, federal governments and the private sector are increasingly focusing their engagement and finance on infrastructure in the region. New ports and harbours, mines, gas and oil pipelines, roads, railways, coastguard facilities and airports to serve the Arctic are materialising at accelerating speed. Much of this development is taking place organically or incrementally, but as this proceeds consideration needs to be given to the physical, environmental and societal impacts of these changes, how they can and should be managed and optimised for the benefit of local and indigenous communities, the Arctic environment and wider regional economy. The recent growth in infrastructure is no small or minor trend, with $300 billion in projects either completed, in motion or proposed in Russia alone.[1] It is also here that the Russian Federation emerges as the clear leader in Arctic infrastructure, followed closely by Finland, Norway, Canada and the United States that have each proposed significant infrastructure investment within their own respective Arctic areas.[2] It is the entrance of China though, with its Polar Silk Road Initiative, comprehensive Arctic Strategy and underwriting of development in the region despite having no territorial claim there, that has been the real game changer, serving to clearly demonstrate the region’s growing global importance.[3]
An inventory of planned, in-progress, completed and cancelled Arctic infrastructure projects compiled in 2016 by global financial firm Guggenheim tallies 900 projects, amounting to an estimated one trillion dollars of infrastructure investment over the next 15 years.[4][5] This is no small or localised economic trend. This ‘opening of the Arctic’ presents both a challenge and an opportunity for a new chapter in development, politics, economics and human affairs. While there are many risks and sensitivities involved, this new chapter is also a powerful one. A chapter in which all Arctic nations and partners could come together to champion the best in sustainable and inclusive design, in order to avoid the mistakes of the past, ensure the best results, and pursue a holistic approach to infrastructure development. As a key feature of this there exists a strong case for articulating a new Arctic Accreditation Scheme for the built environment – a framework and gold standard for the critical mass of infrastructure and development proposed. In turn this also represents an opportunity for the Arctic region too; a sparsely populated part of the world, but a geopolitically powerful one, on the ascendance and capable of demonstrating to the world how it is uniquely placed to be a global leader in robust and sustainable development.
Through the expansion in shipping via new Arctic sea routes, increasingly accessible coastlines and the opening up of new opportunities for resource extraction in the Arctic, the need for a robust, yet flexible, approach to infrastructure development has never been more pertinent than today. By way of an example, cargo transit along the Northern Sea Route reached a volume of seven million tons in 2016, rising to 17 million in 2018 and is assessed to reach 75 million tons per year by 2025.[6][7] With these figures in mind, Russia has been proceeding apace with the construction and development of dedicated deep-water Northern ports and associated infrastructure along its Northern and Eastern coastlines, with $300 billion already invested,[8] and another $82 billion declared in investments over the next five years.[9]
All too often though while billions of dollars of infrastructure is being built, this is typically in response to short-to-medium term and isolated needs, usually to exploit local resources with limited regard for any associated negative impacts for the environment and local population. One such example of this is the intensive expansion of JSC’s Vostochny (Nadkhodka) Port in the Russian Far East, principally for the purpose of significantly increasing coal loading and export, mainly to East Asia and Europe, but which locals and environmental groups complain has been built and is being operated without any adequate protections for the health of the town’s inhabitants or the natural environment.[10] Although Russia has invested in opening a 9,100km dedicated Moscow-to-Vostochny rail service, transporting cargo and container services to and from the port, which operates weekly. [11]

This picture is not a uniform one though either. While Russia is actively investing billions in building new maritime facilities as well as supporting infrastructure, the existing infrastructure in other Arctic states is being developed in an uneven manner, with areas even falling into disrepair and disuse. Arguably, Canada’s Arctic infrastructure is one such example, as it is not being developed in a truly holistic and joined-up fashion. While federal dollars are being spent on infrastructure connecting the interior with coastal Arctic port communities, no investment has been made in those port facilities. Indeed, the recent struggle to maintain and then the subsequent closure of the Port of Churchill in 2016, Canada and North America’s only deepwater port capable of handling Arctic shipping with access via rail to most of North America, exposes the challenges that Canada has had with investment in Arctic infrastructure.[13]
Admittedly, the Canadian government has been investing in Arctic infrastructure, with projects such as with the $300million (CAD) year-round highway connecting Inuvik to Tuktoyaktuk, providing the first ‘all-weather road to Canada’s Arctic Coast’. Locals and government officials alike are anticipating a deepwater port in Tuktoyaktuk to follow, so much so that the road even earned the moniker ‘the world’s longest boat launch’.[14] However, the ability of this road to actually service a port was never fully considered, nor factored into the design process and the road’s weight restrictions, raising many questions about its fitness for purpose. While early indicators do support the case that the road development may bring social and economic benefits to remote communities, as can be evidenced by increased access to healthcare, education and tourism, the road’s utility as infrastructure to service an Arctic port is severely limited.[15][16]
With a historic affiliation to oil from operations in Beaufort Sea, as well as use for coal, timber and grain exports, Tuktoyaktuk has been well placed for many decades, equipped with an existing, albeit small, port facility at which vessels traversing the North West Passage now call.[17] Tuktoyaktuk already has a relatively deepwater port, but suffers from a shallow approach channel, a high degree of in-fill silting and its existing underdeveloped infrastructure, which limit the size of vessels that can berth.[18] Given the lack of any other appropriate or deepwater ports along the entire northern Canadian coastline, Tuktoyaktuk is strategically-positioned as a key location for Arctic shipping, as well as for the implementation of safety preparedness across the Arctic Ocean. There is a case here for the upgrade to an active deepwater port. However, weight restrictions and other design flaws in Tuktoyaktuk’s recently completed highway, combined with on-going road closures, have already severely limited its potential. Arguably, the design and construction of this road did not consider the full scope of its use for the wider region and its economic activities, which raises questions about its strategic value as an investment and whether it represents a missed opportunity. This example in turn posits an important question; could a more holistic framework and agreed set of standards for Arctic infrastructure help prevent such oversights in the future and ensure better value for money?
Standing at the vanguard of what is estimated to become extensive development across the Polar Regions, with a moment to consider the next wave of construction, it can be argued that there currently exists a unique opportunity to take a more enlightened and strategic approach to Arctic development. This is an opportunity to learn from both the mistakes and successes of the Arctic’s past, as well as through the appreciation of the many and varying development attitudes around the globe, and to approach new Arctic development in a new and much more holistic way than before. Recent years have shown that polar construction projects have become more attuned to their environment and context, with some smaller-scale holistic thinking on stakeholder engagement, as well as project management and construction, often driven by the remoteness, inaccessibility and local community needs of the High North. This represents an excellent starting point for how to ensure projects are appropriate to their context and tailored to their needs.
Current environmental changes such as retreating multiyear sea ice and thawing permafrost are not only opening up the Arctic Ocean and landscapes to commercial activities, but are also exposing coastlines to increased erosion and subsequently affecting coastal communities, causing existing infrastructure to collapse and impacting food and water resources upon which local communities depend.
Consideration of the existing approach to built infrastructure, coupled with the increased exposure of the Arctic regions and developing environmental factors, suggests a larger scale holistic approach to infrastructure projects across the High North is required. Through this, sufficient clout will be held to be able to champion sustainable development too. A wider holistic approach may encompass water, waste and energy production, reduction and re-use, energy-positive construction as well as multi-purpose, flexible, resilient and adaptable infrastructure. Development within the Arctic could not only exhibit first-rate engineering and construction standards, but could also be used to bring benefits to society as well. This is especially true if economic investments are directed to target sustainable construction in line with the World Economic Forum’s Arctic Investment Protocol, first launched in 2016, which set out a path towards the more inclusive, transparent, accountable and sustainable development of the Arctic for all inhabitants.[19] The protocol was a world first, and it articulated six key principles for Arctic investment:
1. Build resilient societies through economic development;
2. Respect and include local communities and indigenous peoples;
3. Pursue measures to protect the environment of the Arctic;
4. Practice responsible and transparent business methods;
5. Consult and integrate science and traditional ecological knowledge;
6. Strengthen pan-Arctic collaboration and sharing of best practices.
Given the level of support that the WEF’s Arctic Investment Protocol (AIP) succeeded in securing, with the backing of 22 senior executives from multinational corporations such as Pt Capital, Barclays and China’s COSCO Shipping Corporation, as well as an official endorsement from Guggenheim Partners,[20] any Arctic-wide Sustainable Development framework for the built environment, infrastructure and construction standards should look to build upon this model as a foundation for articulating its own requirements. “To adapt and thrive”, Guggenheim noted in its official endorsement of the protocol, “Arctic communities need critical and careful investment today, paired with a strong commitment to protect and preserve the environment for future generations. Sustainable development therefore is a generational imperative”.[21] The AIP represents a solid foundation on which to establish and build an Arctic-wide framework for development; compelling companies and organisations, engineers and designers to measure their work to a higher standard.
Being at the vanguard of major development within the High North also allows for the implementation of low impact subsistence technologies, such as solar, wind, geothermal, permafrost methane capture and ocean energy capture that will promote and encourage greater dependence on community-led infrastructure. In extension to local considerations, any wider holistic approach ought to bear in mind the need to encompass both existing infrastructure and communities, as well as new developments. An example of this would be the development and adaptation of existing coastal settlements and major infrastructure to serve Arctic-wide needs, such as developing resilience against accelerating rates of coastal erosion and flood resilience as well as increased shipping needs, not seeing them as two separate challenges.
Considering that Arctic coastline erosion is now being seen at a rate of tens of metres per year and that the rate of sea level rise is also accelerating,[22] the current code-based allowances for sea level rise used in the design of coastal infrastructure around the world are no longer applicable. In some instances, the estimate of sea level rise has doubled over the course of four years for select emissions scenarios.[23] The need for truly flexible, resilient and adaptable port and coastal construction is therefore pressing and one that could even support the premise for more radical style of floating infrastructure.
An example of a holistic sustainable programme of development may best be visualised through the 17 Sustainable Development Goals or SDGs,[24] originally proposed by the United Nations in 2015 and subsequently adopted by the Arctic Economic Council and the Arctic Council. The goals most targeted to the built environment and its governing legislation include: Affordable and Clean Energy (Goal 7); Decent work and Economic Growth (Goal 8); Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure (Goal 9); Sustainable Cities and Communities (Goal 11); Responsible Consumption and Production (Goal 12); Climate Action (Goal 13); Life Below Water (Goal 14); Life on Land (Goal 15) and Partnerships for the Goals (Goal 17). Through targeting development in the High North around these goals, the built environment will go a long way to enable a suitable platform for the achievement of the rest.
Figure 3: The United Nation’s 17 Sustainable Development Goals (Source: © United Nations )
An example of the successful implementation of the above SDGs is the Svart Hotel in northern Norway, located at the base of the Svartisen glacier, near Bodø.[25][26] The hotel will be the world’s first energy-positive hotel, an accolade achieved by the harvesting of its own energy. Aside from this, the hotel will also reduce its energy consumption by an impressive 85 percent compared to other modern hotels, implementing numerous energy-positive initiatives that have already set a new standard in sustainable tourism.[27]
Within the Arctic regions, existing remote communities survive without much of the infrastructure that urban populations take for granted. A recent review by the Arctic Council of water and sanitation services in the Arctic reveals that small rural communities have little or no access to improved water and sanitation and conjunctly have no connection to wider infrastructure such as roads or distributed power.[28] Where the issues surrounding water and sanitation should undoubtedly be addressed, the latter is a prime example of where a balanced, holistic and sympathetic approach to development should be applied. When considering an infrastructure model ‘fit for urban areas’, the cost of providing matching infrastructure provision for isolated rural communities is seen as prohibitive. It is exactly these communities, however, that any future development still needs to support. These situations provide excellent scope for the implementation of sustainable, community-owned infrastructure, and it is the experience of these communities that will help shape future Arctic development.
Development for the sake of development, however, must be avoided. Prioritising self-sufficiency over any reliance on global supply chains should be promoted, and sustainable development should be directed to maximise human, social, economic, legacy and environmental benefits, as per the 17 SDGs and the Arctic Investment Protocol. In addition to providing for material needs, development can then instead be used as a very powerful tool to elevate communities and to expand people’s horizons.
The expansion of people’s horizons through infrastructure can include the development of education, trade, amenity provision and entertainment, and can be used to up-skill the population and provide new purposes for communities that have lost their old sources of sustenance/income. A prime example is the training of local people in the skills required to develop their local area as they themselves require and demand. Infrastructure development in turn tackles the remaining SDGs, providing opportunities for long-term improvements in prosperity and health (Goal 3), reductions in poverty and inequality (Goals 1, 10), tackling issues of hunger (Goal 2), quality education (Goal 4), gender equality (Goal 5), and provision of clean water and sanitation (Goal 6).
The environmental benefits of sustainable development include effective reuse and longevity of materials and the built infrastructure, as well as a reduced carbon footprint. This provides long-term economic and social gains such as good environmental stewardship. Additionally, the built environment, through proper planning, can benefit the interaction between humans and the natural environment. It is these two points that support Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions (Goal 16).
Starting afresh, we have an opportunity to build minimally, robustly and appropriately. Only as required, and to avoid consumer-driven mind-sets. Around the globe, development has typically gone hand-in-hand with material prosperity and access to a global supply chain, reinforcing the perception that international products are normal and acceptable by masking their true environmental costs.
In this global supply chain, over 90% of the world’s traded goods are transported by sea,[29] which also carries significant negative environmental impacts. Global shipping is responsible for 3.1% of global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, 13% of global sulphur oxide (SOx) emissions and 15% of nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions per year.[30] Within this, Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO), currently used by some Arctic-going vessels, is recognised as the worst offending form of pollution.[31] Additionally, the consequences of an HFO spill are particularly hazardous given the relative ineffectiveness of oil dispersants, and a dramatically reduced ability to enact clean-up operations once oil dispersion underneath sea ice has occurred.[32] Current tougher energy efficiency standards will help curb pollutants in the future, but unfortunately these do not apply to current vessels. There is, however, rising political, economic and market pressure to phase out HFO usage through The Arctic Commitment; an international campaign to ban HFO powered vessels from the Arctic and to move the shipping industry onto less carbon-intensive forms of fuel.[33] The Arctic Commitment is also notable as a campaign of which Polar Research and Policy Initiative is a proud signatory. This example also highlights how further work needs to be done in the design of infrastructure, as well as any associated accreditation schemes, to support and encourage more sustainable, carbon-neutral forms of goods transportation and related facilities, now and in the future.
In addition to environmental considerations, the global supply chain, specifically shipping in the Arctic, is also vulnerable both to physical and political constraint. This may include extreme weather conditions, rapidly changing product demand, control of shipping routes, and lack of safety and response services. This is another area in need of more holistic consideration.
To realise minimal, robust and appropriate sustainable development, equally rigorous guidance and control must be established through strong institutions and is likely to include:
The question remains, however: how do we achieve a holistic approach to High North infrastructure projects? Principally one that best champions sustainable development and optimises the collective lessons learnt from infrastructure around the world. The answer is to be found in the below five areas;
The issue at hand here is that there is no existing, overarching Arctic-wide sustainable accreditation scheme available. Policies and guidelines are limited to national country-specific regulations, aside from the recommendations laid out by the European Union and the Arctic Council’s Sustainable Development Working Group. Therefore, there exists a strong case for the development of a new, truly holistic Arctic-wide sustainable development accreditation scheme. A framework and gold standard for both Arctic infrastructure and its built environment. This scheme would ideally build upon the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals, draw on best practice and eventually become mandatory for all development within the High North. Given the nature and challenges of the Arctic environment though, this scheme would obviously necessitate some flexibility and should be formulated conjointly with the very latest technical standards and rigorous planning policy. Within the Arctic, projects exhibiting low standards and reckless construction should be treated with a zero tolerance approach, and thus any Arctic-wide scheme should be enforceable, with incentives for compliance and penalties for circumvention.

Holistic, sustainable development within remote or hostile High North environments also comes with a number of specific challenges, as outlined below;

If the aforementioned challenges can be successfully overcome, then there are significant benefits that can be conferred through good design principles and schemes such as Whole Life Costing (WLC). Robust and well-considered design has been proven to save money, lower operational and maintenance costs, reduce environmental impact, improve building and infrastructure performance, extend a project’s lifespan and boost productivity.[37] It is a key measure in the built environment of improving a built asset’s long-term value for money. WLC works best when input takes place right from the start of a project and proceeds through all the stages of design, construction, use and decommissioning, with constant evaluation, feedback and optimisation.[38]
Linked with a sustainable accreditation scheme and rigorous design standards, therefore, WLC would be an effective way to determine the viability of a project and is an appropriate vehicle to drive for efficiency and value. Proof of ‘cradle to grave sustainability’ within a needs-based infrastructure is an approach that would have ample applicability within the Arctic, preventing the oversights that took place at Tuktoyaktuk, among other projects.
Environmental change across the Arctic is opening up the High North to development. With one trillion dollars of infrastructure investment anticipated across the Arctic in the next 15 years, society is in a unique position to champion the very best in sustainable and inclusive design. Drawing on the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals, the High North can promote the very best development as required and driven by local communities, means-tested against rigorous strategic objectives. Given a largely remote and challenging environment, the High North provides a perfect platform for the implementation of locally-driven infrastructure and cutting-edge technology.
However, given that we are now on the cusp of widespread Arctic development, in order to avoid a rat race and degradation of the High North environment, an Arctic-wide Development Framework or accreditation scheme should be implemented to critically assess infrastructure needs and to drive the very highest standards. An Arctic-wide framework for development would help ensure that stringent yet flexible planning processes were implemented, as well as pan-Arctic cooperation and adherence to internationally-recognised technical standards for construction and operations. This could take the form of an Arctic framework or accreditation scheme, drawing on the UN’s 17 SDGs and the Arctic Investment Protocol, whilst incorporating the lessons from Whole Life Costing and other international sustainability standards, by recognising the long-term benefits that they confer upon users, assets and the environment. If there was also the will and determination among all eight Nations of the Arctic Council to sign up to such a framework, then the Arctic would have a powerful standard against which all developments, contractors and companies could be held.
It is the views of the authors that humanity should always endeavour to showcase the manifold benefits of what human ingenuity and sustainable design can achieve, for the mutual betterment of all peoples and societies. It is here, on that principle, that the Arctic has the real and tangible potential to demonstrate exactly this. Standing on the cusp of a new chapter in development; the ‘opening of the Arctic’, but with the time to pause, to consider implications and the manner in which we carry out that development in such a sensitive and important part of the world, that we can act to push the boundaries of human ingenuity, compassion and the integration of technologies. With determination and foresight, we could ensure minimal pollution and environmental damage by demanding a higher standard in both energy use and mitigation measures. We could demand better value for money from our infrastructure and fitness for purpose, as well as enhanced and empowered indigenous engagement and quality of life, as well as crucially, more robust design and sustainability standards. In short, we can and should demand a better standard for the Arctic. Then, in turn, it will be the Arctic’s moment to lead, and to demonstrate to the world a new gold standard for how all infrastructure development should be planned, designed, built and operated. Something we could all benefit from.

Alaska and the Arctic
- Retreating and thinning arctic summer sea ice, increasing temperatures, and ocean acidification are increasingly affecting marine fish and wildlife habitats, species distributions, and food webs, all of which are important to people in the Arctic.
- Arctic residents, communities, and their infrastructure continue to be affected by permafrost thaw, coastal and river erosion, increasing wildfire, and glacier melt. As temperatures continue increasing, individuals and even whole communities will need to decide how and where to live.
- The temperature of permafrost soils in the Arctic is rising, leading to drier landscapes, more wildfire, altered wildlife habitat, and increased costs to maintain infrastructure. Warming and thawing of permafrost soils increases their release of carbon dioxide and methane, leading to further climate warming.
- Strong warming linked to reductions in the area of snow and ice can influence atmospheric circulation and precipitation patterns, both within the Arctic and around the world.
- A warming climate brings threats to human health, especially for rural residents who face increased risk of storm damage and flooding, loss of vital food sources, disrupted traditional practices, or relocation. Implementing proactive adaptation strategies would reduce the physical, social, and psychological harm likely to occur under a warming climate.
- The cumulative effects of climate change in the Arctic strongly affect Native communities and the ecosystems on which they depend. Though these communities have a deep cultural history of adapting to change, they are highly vulnerable to these rapid changes and intensifying impacts.
Key Points:
Scientific evidence demonstrates with increasing clarity and certainty that Earth’s climate is changing: it is becoming warmer and more variable, with more intense floods, storms, and droughts. It is also increasingly clear that higher levels of heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere—the result of fossil-fuel emissions, land clearing, and agriculture—have contributed substantially to climate warming. However, the impacts of these changes in Earth’s climate system vary substantially from place to place. The Arctic, for example, is warming twice as fast as the planet as a whole. It is therefore important to understand these Arctic changes, not only because they are likely to be most readily observed in this temperature-sensitive region, but also because they provide insight into the general nature of resilience and vulnerability that may occur on the rest of the planet if climate continues to warm.
The Arctic is projected to continue warming much faster than the rest of the planet if greenhouse gases continue to accumulate in the atmosphere. Managing the responses of ecosystems and society to recent and projected warming requires that we understand not only the changes in climate, but also the changes in ecosystems and their cumulative effects on society. In particular, it is important to know how these processes interact and when these interactions lead to either non-linear (either magnifying or stabilizing) responses or threshold changes in the behavior of the system. Loss of sea ice, glaciers, or permafrost (permanently frozen ground), for example, might dramatically alter the Arctic for both ecosystems and society.
Arctic change is important to global society not only because of its impacts within the Arctic, but also because of the role of the Arctic in the climate of the entire Earth. The climate and the ocean circulation in all parts of the globe are affected by the temperature and pressure gradients between the poles and the equator. These temperature and pressure gradients are becoming weaker because the Arctic is warming faster than lower latitudes. The resulting changes in climate and weather will affect people everywhere.
Kivalina, Alaska. Humans have been a part of the Alaskan Arctic coastline for thousands of years. In recent times, their villages have consolidated and include permanent infrastructure such as roads, runways, and power-generating stations. Many of these communities are just a few meters above sea level and are vulnerable to storm surges and rising sea levels.
Understanding change is the first step toward understanding and building Arctic resilience and reducing its vulnerability to climate change. Systems are resilient when system responses counteract changes that would otherwise have occurred—in other words, when there are stabilizing feedbacks. For example, if society were to adapt to climate warming by reducing fossil fuel emissions, this would reduce the rate of climate warming. Similarly, if Arctic peoples adapt to declining opportunities to hunt ice-dependent marine mammals by diversifying their food sources, this could stabilize their food supply. In ecological systems, a shift from coniferous to deciduous forests would replace flammable coniferous trees with less flammable deciduous ones, which counteracts the effect of rising temperature and drying soils on fire frequency and extent.

Unfortunately, most of the feedbacks and interactions involved in Arctic change are reducing the resilience of the Arctic. For example, the decline in cover of sea ice, glaciers, and snow cover replaces a white reflective surface with a darker, more absorptive surface of land or water. This increases the absorption of heat by the surface and thus increases the rate of Arctic warming. Similarly, increased fire extent, permafrost loss, decomposition, and methane emission in response to Arctic warming increases emissions of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, and increases climate warming at the global scale—a decrease in climate resilience at the global scale. Adapting to Arctic changes in ways that increase Arctic resilience—for example, by reducing the soot deposition that darkens Arctic snow surfaces—will be a major challenge in the coming decades.

2020 has seen a deluge of Arctic interest from Moscow in terms of investments, military footprints, and indeed, Kremlin policy planning documents.
The melting Arctic is opening a treasure chest of... Russian strategic planning documents. Indeed, 2020 has seen an overhaul of Russian Arctic strategy, as previously examined here. This week Putin approved the “Strategy for the Development of the Russian Arctic Zone (RAZ) and provision of National Security through to 2035.” This document is essentially Moscow’s blueprint to deliver on key aims and objectives of Russian Arctic strategy (as laid out in this year’s earlier Arctic release—the “Foundations of State Policy of the Russian Federation in the Arctic to 2035”).
Russian Arctic strategy is a mosaic of policies and agendas driven by a litany of government agencies. Fundamentally, there are three policy documents to be read together when considering Russia’s Arctic strategy. As noted above, there is the “State Policy” document which outlines key goals and Moscow’s Arctic agenda. Then we have the state program on “Socio-Economic Development of the RAZ.” The “Socio-Economic Development” program is essentially the implementation plan. Russia’s National Security Council flagged drafting of the “Strategy for Development,” the third document, back in February. Released this week, this third document outlines the mechanisms for which “State Policy” and the “Socio-Economic Development” plans in the Arctic are to be realized.
Russia is the largest stakeholder in Arctic affairs by way of sheer geography. Moscow’s RAZ is as much about the onshore Russian Arctic territory (the entire zone of Russia above the Arctic Circle) as it is the offshore Russian Arctic. The offshore RAZ is legitimately Russian under the auspices of the international legal architecture—UNCLOS. The popular sense of Russian expansion into the Arctic Ocean is rather ill-informed. Nonetheless, Russian Arctic policy documents refer to the RAZ as opposed to the broader sense of the Arctic global commons.
Given the significance of resources and economic investment (let alone the sheer size of the open Arctic border), the RAZ holds evident national security standing. The “2020 Strategy for Development of the RAZ” outlines various challenges to the pace and process of Moscow’s development goals in its region as posed to national security. In a departure from Arctic policy documents coming out of Washington, Moscow features the challenge of climate change (man-made and “natural” variants). Population decline in the RAZ territories and evident challenges related to the sub-par quality of life afforded to Arctic residents are further roadblocks to development ambitions. The “Strategy for Development” outlines failing social services, inadequate housing, lack of transport, and broader infrastructure challenges as issues to overcome. Further, occupational work risks (associated with energy industries in the RAZ) and underfunded emergency health capabilities are leveled as challenges to the development of the Russian Arctic.
Most of the challenges tabled in terms of developing the Russian Arctic are indeed domestic in nature. Which is not surprising. Even the one reference in the document to external competition is linked to the impact an “increase in conflict potential” of the Arctic will have on domestic development goals in the RAZ. This is again to be expected given the rationale of this policy document—how the state plans to build the necessary infrastructure and baseline for achieving the strategic Arctic goals. For instance, to be an Arctic energy superpower in export terms, the RAZ needs hospitable industrial towns—Moscow needs to attract the workforce for the labor-intensive energy industry.
Next, the “Strategy for Development” outlines how Moscow plans to counter these domestic challenges. The focus here is on the social development of the RAZ via the implementation of social support from investment in health care and education. Priority is to be placed on state-funded programs which will ensure modernization and accessibility of goods and services in the RAZ. The development of small-to-medium enterprises, support for cultural heritage programs, and the creation of modern urban cities are further objectives in countering regional challenges. Overall, the creation of modern urban cities in the RAZ is the end-goal for Russia’s Arctic development strategy.
Spending is evidently underway with a slew of projects greenlit in this development strategy. Crafting the RAZ into a tourist haven along with the production of a Russian cruise ship fleet are flagged. As is the implementation of new shipping lanes in the Northern Sea Route (NSR) and the Barents, White, and Pechora Seas. Security watchers will be enticed by the development strategy’s note that Moscow will stand-up a headquarters for NSR Maritime Operations. Further, Russia’s Arctic development strategy calls for five more nuclear-powered icebreakers (of the 22220 Project), three nuclear-powered icebreakers out of the Leader Project, sixteen rescue and tug vessels, three hydrographic vessels, and two further ships. This procurement is bolstered by a new cargo ship program to support merchant shipping in the RAZ.
In terms of delivering on the RAZ’s development goals, Moscow reiterates the necessity for a cooperative Arctic region. Indeed, conflict is not only bad for a burgeoning energy export business. It is costly and will divert funds and manpower from the RAZ industry. The Kremlin will implement a “multi-vector” foreign policy to ensure the Arctic remains a “territory of peace, stability and mutually beneficial cooperation.” The concept of mutually beneficial cooperation is somewhat of a crowd favorite in Putin’s Russia. In the RAZ energy sphere, this screams “work together, until it no longer works”—with a dash of Russian rules and regulations. Nonetheless, the “Strategy for Development” reminds Arctic neighbors that engagement will occur on the basis of “international treaties, agreements, and conventions.” Of course, international law in the Arctic falls well and truly in Russia’s favor to uphold.
Should mutually beneficial cooperation fail, there is also a pointed military security development strategy for the RAZ. Here, Moscow outlines development plans for the structure of the Armed Forces in the region. Seeking to maintain a “level of combat readiness of the groupings” in the RAZ, the development plan outlines priority to equip Armed Forces with modern kits “adapted to Arctic conditions.” Development of base infrastructure is placed in the context of a move towards the RAZ housing technology and infrastructure with “dual-use” purpose. The rationale becomes: defend the RAZ and northern frontier from aggression while aiding in search and rescue capacities where needed.
All in all, there is not too much out of the ordinary in this policy document. Of interest is the framing of “equality” with Norway regarding the increasingly touchy issue of Svalbard. In this strategy, Moscow clearly signaled “Russian presence in Spitzbergen” will continue. As are the indications of Russia’s Arctic Council Chairmanship platform—for the period of 2021-2023. Coordination with Arctic States will continue, primarily in the “framework of the Arctic Coast Guard Forum.” The role of the Arctic Economic Council as “one of the central forums for sustainable development” in the Arctic is also placed squarely in Moscow’s Chairmanship planning.
We can expect Moscow to keep tensions low in the high north at the helm of the Arctic Council. The “Strategy for Development” further underlines the importance to Russia of the “effective participation” in the Council for realizing its development objectives. Priorities of its 2021-2023 Chairmanship will likely include the “sustainable development of the Arctic” and programs supporting the cultural heritage of indigenous peoples throughout the Arctic.
2020 has seen a deluge of Arctic interest from Moscow in terms of investments, military footprints, and indeed, Kremlin policy planning documents. Some lofty ambitions continue to sneak into these planning documents, with this recent decree putting NSR cargo at 130 million tons per year by 2035. In 2019 the NSR managed just 31.5 million tons. Of course, further Kremlin policy for the RAZ will be unveiled no doubt as we await the updated Russian “National Security Strategy” due in 2020. Something tells me this burst of Russian Arctic policy documents will do very little to alleviate warming tensions in the Arctic, let alone freeze the pace of hot takes signaling the arrival of a ‘new’ Cold War.

Our Story
Founded in 1977 by the late Eben Hopson of Barrow, Alaska, the Inuit Circumpolar Council (ICC) has flourished and grown into a major international non-government organization representing approximately 180,000 Inuit of Alaska, Canada, Greenland, and Chukotka (Russia). The organization holds Consultative Status II at the United Nations.
To thrive in their circumpolar homeland, Inuit had the vision to realize they must speak with a united voice on issues of common concern and combine their energies and talents towards protecting and promoting their way of life. The principal goals of ICC are, therefore, to strengthen unity among Inuit of the circumpolar region; promote Inuit rights and interests on an international level; develop and encourage long-term policies that safeguard the Arctic environment; and seek full and active partnership in the political, economic, and social development of circumpolar regions.
ICC holds a General Assembly every four years at which delegates from across the circumpolar region elect a new Chair and an executive council, develop policies, and adopt resolutions that will guide the activities of the organization for the coming term. The General Assembly is the heart of the organization, providing an opportunity for sharing information, discussing common concerns, debating issues, and strengthening the bonds between all Inuit. Representatives from the Inuit Circumpolar Youth Council and the International Elders Council attend, thereby improving communications and creating synergies with these important affiliated organizations.
In 2006 at the ICC General Assembly, held in Barrow, Alaska, ICC was instructed to “annually proclaim November 7th, the birth date of ICC visionary, Eben Hopson, Sr., as Inuit Day, and to urge all Inuit governments, agencies, and communities to annually proclaim this day as Inuit Day, and conduct appropriate ceremonies and celebrations.”",,,,,2018-12-17,Inuit Circumpolar Council Canada

Thank you, it's a huge pleasure to be here.
Scotland and Iceland share ties of trade, culture and kinship which go back for centuries. In fact the early history of the Orkney Islands, in the north of Scotland, was chronicled in the Icelandic sagas more than 800 years ago. More recently, in 1874, the national anthem of Iceland was composed in central Edinburgh. And even more recently than that, Scotland gave Iceland another anthem. Your football supporters' 'Viking chant' – which attracted worldwide attention at Euro 2016 – was reportedly inspired by a similar chant by fans of a Scottish football team – Motherwell. I bring that up because of course from our point of view, it was nice just to have any Scottish presence at Euro 2016!
At the moment, Iceland and Scotland co-operate on areas ranging from energy policy to marine science to sustainable tourism – in fact our tourism agencies are today signing a memorandum of understanding.
And of course Scotland's ties with Iceland are mirrored in our connections to many of the other countries represented here today – for example our ancestral ties to Canada or our trading links with nations such as South Korea and Japan. We also often learn from your countries in our social and economic policy. For example, we are aiming to adopt Finland's policy of giving expectant parents a Baby Box containing vital items to help them look after their babies in the earliest days.
Scotland may not quite, geographically, be part of the Arctic Circle, but in our heritage, culture, policy approach – and sometimes maybe even our weather! – there is much that we share.
Those shared interests are actually the theme of a Scottish art installation – Prospect North – which I am opening later today on the first level of this venue. I hope that as many of you as possible will visit and enjoy it.
And of course Scotland and Iceland also – like so many of the delegates to this forum – share a strong commitment to tackling climate change. That's an issue which I discussed with former President Grimsson during the Paris Climate Change summit last December, and it's the reason why he invited me to speak here today.
And so, I'm going to concentrate in this speech on the steps Scotland is taking to tackle climate change and to promote climate justice. And in doing that, I want to set out a wider message about the positive contribution Scotland wants to make to the rest of the world, and our desire for even stronger partnerships with our northern neighbours.
Now, the Paris Agreement which stemmed from last December's summit is the most significant step yet towards tackling climate change. I am sure that all of us welcome Wednesday's announcement that the agreement will come into force on 4 November. It's a remarkable achievement – not least for Ban-Ki Moon, who will address this forum tomorrow, and who has prioritised climate change throughout his time as Secretary General of the UN.
However Paris marks a milestone, not a final destination. A global temperature increase of 1 degree Celsius – which is what we saw in 2015 – has already brought the melting of glaciers and ice-sheets here in the Arctic, together with drought and extreme weather incidents around the world. The consequences of a 2 degree increase would be deeply damaging for all nations, and catastrophic for some. Among other things, it would bring rising ocean levels, an increased number of famines – and, almost certainly, a displacement of populations far beyond what we have seen from recent and current conflicts such as Syria. That helps to explain why – when Ban-Ki Moon spoke in Paris last year – he called climate change 'the defining challenge of our time'.
So it is essential that the world meets the overall target we set ourselves in Paris, of limiting global temperature increases to well below 2 degrees Celsius, and making serious efforts to keep them below 1.5 degrees.
Let me be clear – that means going beyond the specific pledges made last year, which would still lead to warming of more than 2 degrees Celsius. We cannot simply applaud ourselves for the agreement reached in Paris – important though it is. We need to deliver on – and exceed – the specific commitments made last year.
Scotland will play its part. As the video showed, in 2009 our Parliament unanimously passed its Climate Change Act. Using the year 1990 as a starting point, the Act committed Scotland to a 42% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020, and an 80% reduction by 2050.
It's worth noting that, at that time, a 42% reduction by 2020 was the most ambitious legal target anywhere in the world. Scotland deliberately set a goal that we thought would be difficult. However we achieved our 2020 target in 2014 – and we did so six years ahead of schedule. So we are looking to do even better. We aim to more than halve our 1990 emissions by 2020.
That involves looking at a huge range of issues. Scotland has reduced energy use by almost a sixth since 1990 – but we know we need to do more. That's why we recently made energy efficiency a national infrastructure priority. And we see big opportunities for Scotland in areas such as renewable heat and developing the circular economy.
And of course we're expanding renewable energy supply. When our Climate Change Act was passed seven years ago, 28% of Scotland's electricity demand was met by renewable power. Last year, the figure was 57%. That still puts Scotland a long way behind countries such as Iceland and Norway, but it's a big increase – largely caused by onshore wind production.
We aim to do better in the years and decades ahead. And so we're now increasingly looking at offshore resources. The video highlighted that our European Marine Energy Centre in Orkney is a global leader. In fact, more wave and tidal power companies have demonstrated their technologies there than at any other site in the world.
Last month I launched the first stage of the Meygen tidal array project. When it is fully deployed in the Pentland Firth, it will produce enough electricity to power approximately 175,000 homes – that makes it the largest planned tidal stream project anywhere in the world.
There are also some hugely significant projects in relation to offshore wind. The largest floating windfarm in the world is being developed by Statoil – the Norwegian energy company – off the North Sea coast of Scotland. It is potentially a hugely important step towards making offshore wind economically viable in deep waters.
Scotland's northern seas were central to the Norse culture that so many of the countries here share. But they can sometimes seem peripheral to the wider world. So it is wonderful that they are now at the cutting edge of global energy innovation – technologies being tried and developed there now will play a part in providing the renewable energy the world needs in the future.
And of course, that won't simply bring environmental gains, it will also create economic benefits. In Scotland, the low carbon and renewable energy sector already supports more than 21,000 jobs.
There is the potential for many more. And of course other low carbon advances – such as better energy efficiency – will make our businesses more competitive. The need to tackle climate change, first and foremost, is an overwhelming moral imperative – but it is also a significant economic opportunity. It is one that all of us should aim to seize.
Scotland's approach to climate change is part of a deeper desire to be a good international citizen. We want to set a good example through our domestic policy – and to learn from other countries as we do so. However we also want to recognise our international responsibilities.
Today we have announced a £1 million contribution to the Capacity Building Initiative for Transparency. That's the fund established by the United Nations after Paris, in recognition of the fact that many developing nations currently lack the capacity to measure their greenhouse gas emissions accurately.
Scotland's contribution comes from our Climate Justice fund. One key point about climate change is that its worst effects are often felt in developing nations – despite the fact that those nations have not usually been major emitters of greenhouse gases. In addition, the individuals affected by climate change are often the very young, the very old, the ill, and the very poor. Women are suffering disproportionately, since they are often the main providers of food, fuel and water.
So, the countries which have done least to cause climate change, and the people who are least equipped to cope with its consequences, are the ones who are being hit hardest.
That's why, in 2012, Scotland became the first national government in the world to establish a climate justice fund. We increased our support for the fund this year. So far it has supported 11 projects in four sub-Saharan African countries.
The fund is small in terms of the scale of the problem – tiny, in fact. But it makes a significant difference in the communities where it operates. And it is a powerful statement from a country which is determined to do the right thing.
That motivation also lies Scotland's increasing role in international development.
Last year, we were one of the first national governments to confirm that we would adopt the new sustainable development goals. In doing so, we committed ourselves to tackling poverty and supporting sustainable growth within Scotland. And we also pledged to promote international development overseas. That's been a growing priority for us in recent years – we have development partnerships with Pakistan, Malawi, Zambia and Rwanda.
In doing that, we work closely and well with the UK Government. However we also look to learn from other countries. For example the annual Contribution to Development Index suggests that four of the five most effective countries in the world – in terms of the overall impact of their policies on international development – are Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Finland.
And so Scotland is now pursuing approaches which have been pioneered by Sweden and others – such as the idea that all Government policies, not just aid policies, should be consistent with international development goals. It's a good example of how the exchange of ideas among Arctic Circle countries can have a positive impact across the world.
Scotland's commitment to internationalism is relevant to one final issue I want to talk about this morning. Earlier this year the Scottish Government argued strongly for the UK to remain a member of the European Union. We welcome the EU's practical benefits – free trade, free movement, social and environmental protections. But, for all its imperfections, we also admire the principle behind it – we like the idea of independent countries working together for a common good.
And we believe that on some issues – and climate change is a good example – 28 independent nations working together can have a bigger impact than one on its own. In Paris last year, the European Union was plausibly able to negotiate with the United States and China as an equal. It played an important role in influencing the talks towards a successful conclusion.
For all of these reasons, people in Scotland voted clearly – by 62% to 38% – to remain in the EU. And so the Scottish Government is currently looking to find solutions which enable us to retain the benefits of European Union membership. We are also arguing strongly for the United Kingdom to retain membership of the single market, even as it leaves the EU. After all, the different Nordic countries here have taken different views on European Union membership, but all – including Norway and Iceland – have chosen to be members of the single market.
Fundamentally, Scotland will do everything we can to remain an open, inclusive and welcoming nation – working with our neighbours, playing a positive role in the world, and strengthening rather than weakening our partnerships with other nations. Our friendships and partnerships with the countries around us matter deeply to us. We will not allow them to be damaged by Brexit.
And that, of course, is why we warmly welcome the chance to contribute to this Arctic Circle gathering. At a time when insularity and protectionism can seem to be gaining ground, Iceland should be praised for establishing an important new forum for international co-operation. Scotland will support it in any way we can.
In doing so, we recognise that the principles behind this Arctic Circle resonate with a significant moment from Iceland's recent past.
Tuesday will see the 30th anniversary of the Reykjavik summit between President Reagan and General Secretary Gorbachev. It took place less than a mile from here. The summit did not see any immediate agreement, but General Secretary Gorbachev subsequently referred to it as a 'turning point' in the Cold War. Within 14 months, the USA and the USSR had negotiated reductions in missile stocks, which would have seemed inconceivable in previous decades. And just three years later, the Berlin Wall fell, as the Cold War came to an end and barriers across Europe came down.
Just before he departed for Reykjavik, President Reagan remarked on Iceland's willingness to act as host. He said that 'there could be no better testimony to the enduring commitment of the Icelandic people and government to the search for a just peace.'
The fears of the Cold War have been replaced now by other issues, including rising isolationism and international security concerns. But arguably the defining challenge of our generation – as Ban-Ki Moon said last year – is climate change. And so it is fitting that Iceland is again demonstrating its enduring commitment to a just and peaceful world. You are bringing people together to help find solutions to climate change, and to the interrelated challenges and opportunities that Arctic Circle countries share.
Scotland – a country proud of our Nordic connections, committed to our European neighbours, and keen to work with our friends from around the world – is an obvious and willing partner for you.
So I wish all of the delegates here all the best for the rest of this assembly. I hope that it can play some part in addressing climate change, promoting climate justice, and encouraging peace and sustainable prosperity. Because by doing so, it will make a positive contribution – not just to the people and environment of the arctic – but to the wellbeing of the wider world.

By Martin Breum
US secretary of state Mike Pompeo is to meet Russia's minister of foreign affairs Sergey Lavrov on Monday (6 May) in Rovaniemi, the main city in Finland's Arctic region, amidst tensions over both climate change and Chinese ambitions in the polar region.
Here they will engage in talks also with the foreign ministers of the six other nations in the Arctic Council, the prime forum for cooperation in the Arctic region.

On Monday afternoon, Pompeo will deliver a speech on US priorities in the Arctic, a region quickly moving up on the agenda of president Donald Trump's administration and of the Pentagon. The US is counted as an Arctic state because of the state of Alaska.
Prior to the meeting, US reluctance to recognise climate change as a key problem in the Arctic has frustrated negotiations on a joint declaration and on the Arctic Council's first ever longer term strategy, which the ministers were expected to adopt.
Global warming develops more than twice as fast in the Arctic than on the rest of the globe. Several governments in the Arctic, including the five Nordic governments, are keen to boost common efforts to combat climate change and to assist the local Arctic communities and the fragile environment.
The US negotiators, however, have reportedly been adverse to such common climate action. Some observers fear that the foreign ministers will agree only on a meagre status quo or even a diminished set of joint climate change ambitions.
One leading observer of Arctic cooperation, professor Timo Koivurova, who is head of the Arctic Centre of the University of Rovaniemi, shared his frustration with EUobserver. ""That is the concern that I have and also with me many of those who are following the Arctic Council for the moment,"" he said.
""The question is really now whether the US can live with the current level of climate change work. Already, the Arctic Council is doing so much about climate change, whether its scientific assessments or increasing the capacity in the Arctic regions to adapt to climate change consequences and the work on methane and black carbon.""
Lavrov critical of US
The ministers, who will meet alongside representatives of the Arctic peoples, gather for a biannual ministerial meeting of the Arctic Council on Tuesday.
US diplomats two years ago helped kick-start negotiations on a common long term strategy, but now other Arctic governments might prefer to postpone adoption of a strategy - rather than bow to US pressure and adopt one weak on climate change ambition.
Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov, speaking with the state wire service TASS at an Arctic conference in St Petersburg in April, said that the US sought to block mention of not just climate change, but also of the Paris Agreement on climate and the United Nations' 2030 sustainable development goals.
An unnamed diplomat involved in the talks last week told the Washington Post that US ""indicated its resistance to any mention of climate change whatsoever"".
In attempts to secure progress without explicitly mentioning climate change some actors within the Arctic Council have attempted to build consensus instead around pursuit of the UN Sustainable Development Goals, but also on this stretch they have met US resistance, Koivurova told EUobserver.
""I have felt it in my own work. First they had problems with the individual goals. I was told not to mention any of the individual goals, but then by the end of the day they asked that the SDGs were not mentioned at all,"" he says.
US concerns over China in Arctic
In his speech Pompeo will most likely air US concerns not only over Russian military build-up in the Arctic, but also over China's emerging interests in the region.
In late April, the US Department of Defense aired its concerns in its annual report on China's military strength to the US Congress, describing how China is rapidly expanding its scientific research facilities in the Arctic, icebreaker capabilities, commercial investments and diplomatic ties in the region.
""Civilian research could support a strengthened Chinese military presence in the Arctic Ocean, which could include deploying submarines to the region as a deterrent against nuclear attacks,"" the report said.
Similar concern over China's growing Arctic presence was also aired in an Arctic strategic outlook published by the US Coast Guard in April.
This report, incidentally, also illustrated US reluctance to recognise climate change.
The term ""climate change"" did not appear in the 46 page document.
Instead, climate change effects in the Arctic, including mudslides, eroded coastal communities, acidification of the seas, melting permafrost and the receding ice-cover was described as ""environmental transformation"".
EU status a non-issue
The EU will have no formal say at the meeting in Rovaniemi. The EU Council adopted its first Arctic strategy in 2008, but all attempts to be admitted as a formal observer to the Arctic Council has since failed.
A string of EU member states have been observers to the Arctic Council for years, including the United Kingdom, France, Netherlands, Poland, Spain and Germany, but the EU's ambition to become a formal observer were thwarted - first by Canada and Arctic communities angry about the EU's policies on the sale of seal skin, and then, since the Crimea crisis in 2014, by Russia.
Many within the Arctic Council, however, tend to deal with this as a non-issue, says professor Koivurova: ""That is exactly how I see it. In practice, the EU is treated like any other observer,"" he said.
The EU contributes increasingly to the work of the Arctic Council's scientific working groups, where the bulk of the work of the Arctic Council takes place, and representatives from the EU appear as part of the stable crowd at most Arctic Council gatherings.
No fishing at the North Pole
In Rovaniemi, the Arctic diplomats - if true to habit - will talk little in public of their disagreements on climate change. Instead, they will celebrate the many tangible results of Arctic cooperation.
A moratorium on fishing in the international waters in Arctic Ocean around the North Pole was imposed in 2018, and binding agreements on prevention of oil spills, search and rescue at sea and science cooperation have been adopted.
The Arctic Council's scientific working groups enrich global climate projections and efforts to preserve biodiversity, and still more observer countries like China, Japan, Korea, are being integrated into this work.
Finland, who has chaired the Arctic Council for the last two years, have engaged the World Meteorological Organisation which now contributes to more precise climate projections, and better ice- and weather services in the Arctic.
At a time of increased international tension and sanctions between the US, the EU and Russia following Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea, the presence of all eight Arctic foreign ministers will be interpreted as an important sign of governmental support for continued cooperation in the Arctic.
In January 2018, some 60 academics from the University of the Arctic Thematic Network on Geopolitics and Security nominated the Arctic Council for the Nobel Peace Prize, in part for its ability to expand cooperation on climate change, community support, biodiversity, environmental protection and so forth even as Russia and the rest of the Arctic states disagree on developments elsewhere.

Nowhere is this more evident, perhaps, than in the Arctic, yet this region remains one of the most remote and difficult to study. Researchers have increasingly relied on animal tracking data in these regions to understand individual species' responses, but if we want to understand larger-scale change, we need to integrate our understanding across species. Davidson et al. introduce an open-source data archive that currently hosts more than 15 million location data points across 96 species and use it to show distinct climate change responses across species. Such ecological “big data” can lead to a wider understanding of change. Science , this issue p. [712][1] The Arctic is entering a new ecological state, with alarming consequences for humanity. Animal-borne sensors offer a window into these changes. Although substantial animal tracking data from the Arctic and subarctic exist, most are difficult to discover and access. Here, we present the new Arctic Animal Movement Archive (AAMA), a growing collection of more than 200 standardized terrestrial and marine animal tracking studies from 1991 to the present. The AAMA supports public data discovery, preserves fundamental baseline data for the future, and facilitates efficient, collaborative data analysis. With AAMA-based case studies, we document climatic influences on the migration phenology of eagles, geographic differences in the adaptive response of caribou reproductive phenology to climate change, and species-specific changes in terrestrial mammal movement rates in response to increasing temperature.

This ‘pause’ gives an opportunity to reflect on the current state and the future of Arctic science and move towards a more resilient, thus equitable, coordinated, safe and locally-embedded Arctic research enterprise. Arctic science has been greatly affected by COVID-19. This comment looks forward to how Arctic science could be conducted in the future.
The Arctic has been at the centre of recent climate-driven changes influencing global climate dynamics, regional weather, and international commerce1. Now, the scientific community finds Arctic research capabilities severely limited by travel bans and our own trepidation of becoming vectors transmitting COVID-19. Arctic communities have justifiably asked that travel to their areas be curtailed. The consequences of the prolonged gap in field research will resonate for decades across scientific disciplines, through policy decisions, and into economic investments.
COVID-19 is not just an immediate danger for the Arctic. It will have lasting effects on communities as the current health, food security, and economic issues become exacerbated. Remote Arctic villages are poised to experience significant economic losses (including the earnings from hosting science operations), endure reduction of transportation accessibility, and may also face the loss of key knowledge holders—including elders—and thus the loss of culture, heritage, and tradition.
This article, co-written by Indigenous natural and social science experts, represents a synthesis of perspectives from the International Arctic Science Committee (IASC), the International Arctic Social Sciences Association (IASSA), and the University of the Arctic (UArctic) to help guide the science community’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the Arctic. We argue that although Arctic research has been disrupted, this pause is giving us a unique opportunity to reflect on the current state and the future of Arctic science and work on building a more resilient, equitable, coordinated, safe, and locally embedded Arctic research enterprise.
COVID-19 impacts on Arctic science
Arctic context for COVID-19
The Arctic is home to more than four million people, including Indigenous Peoples. Most remote settlements in the Arctic possess limited, if any, health-care facilities. They also have constrained financial and public resources and often suffer from food security issues and overcrowded housing2. Many of the smaller villages are not equipped with civic infrastructure, making it difficult to implement COVID-19 preventive measures. Connectivity of rural communities by transport and by Internet is often poor and limits opportunities for medical evacuation or telemedicine. Consequently, Arctic regions are particularly vulnerable to COVID-19.
Pandemics in the Arctic were disastrous in the past, so communities are now rightfully wary of any outside visitors. Multiple reports indicate that during COVID-19 the Indigenous Peoples have used traditional knowledge and lessons learnt from past pandemics. For example, Dene and Inuit communities in the Canadian Arctic encouraged their members to go on the land to ensure food security and maintain their health3. During COVID-19 isolation, a UArctic network of Indigenous colleges from Kola, Taimyr, Yamal, Nenets, Komi, and Sakha used their partnership to create online learning solutions that share knowledge on reindeer husbandry, Indigenous business, fishing, and tourism. A new Arctic Indigenous Virtual Arts Network (AIVAN) was established to connect Indigenous artists. The International Sámi Film Institute developed 15 short films to document the impact of COVID-19 on Indigenous Peoples and Indigenous knowledge-based responses in northern Sweden, Finland, Norway, and Russia. The films will be part of the Arctic Indigenous Film Academy and Film Witness. Building on Western science and Indigenous knowledge together to address the COVID-19 pandemic will be important in the coming months and years.
Impacts on field research and observations
Even in the best of times, field research in the Arctic regions is quite limited, with sparse observations of atmospheric, marine, and terrestrial variables, biological processes, and social systems4. Some research that is able to utilize satellite data may well be able to continue largely uninterrupted, but vital in situ field research has been severely impaired. The consequences of a lost season of field observations will propagate through all Arctic sciences and reverberate globally.
Although research in natural sciences is often conducted in remote regions away from settlements, almost all of these field studies have been cancelled or majorly modified over the anxiety of carrying the virus to regional hubs by science expeditions coming from outside the region. Ocean cruises that wouldn’t have visited any communities have also been cancelled to protect members of the scientific parties. Simultaneously, research by local community experts has also been restricted by quarantine measures. Although some found creative solutions, like in Svalbard, where the out-of-job tourist guides were remotely provided with basic training to do the annual reindeer monitoring, only limited information was collected. There are already successful examples of adapting field work to the new reality. The internationally collaborative MOSAiC Expedition, the largest Arctic research expedition ever, solved the challenges by modifying the logistics and part of its research programme5. Yet, further action needs to be taken to develop more resilient research in the Arctic and to avoid loss of data and knowledge, while being responsive to the needs and security of local communities.
An opportunity for reflection
Extreme events like the COVID-19 pandemic require immediate actions, but may also give time for reflection. The ‘pause’ in the pace of research serves a unique opportunity to scientists to publish and organize existing data, but, most importantly, to take a step back and critically assess the ways in which Arctic science should be conducted. It also may provide a chance for Arctic communities to reflect on the nature of this collaboration given their own priorities and consider what sort of science they will welcome in the future.
We need resilient, adaptive Arctic science that is community relevant and locally embedded, and yet strives to bridge major knowledge gaps of global relevance. Only then will science persist in the Arctic regardless of all disturbances. Strong collaboration, deep trust, and a high level of competence held locally in the Arctic are the sources of resilience that will enable observations, research, and knowledge co-production under dire circumstances, such as this pandemic.
Recommendations: building resilient Arctic science
Doing no harm
First and foremost, Arctic scientists must do no harm. Therefore, avoiding travel to Arctic communities to prevent the spread of COVID-19 until all risks are eliminated is essential. In this period, the scientific discovery in the Arctic shall continue, but it will look differently in both the short and long term.
Embracing the ‘local turn’ and knowledge co-production
The COVID-19 pandemic has re-emphasized that science needs permanent presence in the Arctic. Field stations, community observation systems, local colleges, and community experts reduce the need for outside specialists to conduct observations and maintain instruments (Fig. 1). Thus, investing in Arctic infrastructure is an acute science priority. Re-focusing Arctic science to localized operations is not a simple or inexpensive option, but now is the time to support a broader, localized science infrastructure network that is currently lagging. This investment though needs to be done hand-in-hand with the process of decolonizing Arctic science and embracing Indigenous, traditional, and local knowledge systems.
The need for this ‘local turn’ is very real and long overdue6. In Alaska’s Bering Strait region, for example, an Indigenous consortium delivered a scathing assessment of research practices in their homelands7,8. The community pointed out that the research has been often initiated, developed, and conducted without consulting the region’s Indigenous Peoples or ensuring their meaningful participation. Scientists sometimes have carried out their projects by disrupting traditional practices, disregarding customs, or overwhelming communities with redundant research that generated minimal feedback. The consequence has been not only a “reproduction of long-standing colonial dynamics”, but poor, inadequate science since “inequitable research can lead to misinformed results, incomplete data, and research fatigue on the part of region residents and communities”7.
Although field seasons and travel to the Arctic will continue after the pandemic ends, to build a resilient knowledge-building system in the Arctic, science must rely on local partnerships that are based on equity, trust, and respect. This necessitates collaborating with Indigenous and local communities to co-produce knowledge. Under the leadership of Indigenous Peoples, co-production will lead to improved science because it will be enriched by diverse Indigenous knowledge systems and will give voice to youth and elders. Co-production will redesign, decolonize, and indigenize science–community relationships and develop better, more equitable engagement mechanisms, and, thus, make research a source of empowerment9. We are encouraged by a number of successful co-production initiatives, such as the EALÁT Institute10 and Indigenous Food Knowledges Network11, and hope more will emerge.
As a first step, scientists must ask communities about their concerns and priorities prior to creating research agendas. This means involving Arctic residents and experts remotely to develop research plans and conduct research, providing equipment and fair pay. This requires investing in local capacity-building, along with funding community members to conduct collaborative and independent research, and supporting citizen science, including teachers and students in schools, a contribution that will have a lasting impact. Good examples, such as ELOKA12, SmartICE13 and ASAD14 projects, could serve as blueprints for future locally embedded research initiatives. UIC Science, a science logistics service in Utqiagvik, Alaska, demonstrates how investment in local capacities can provide continuous support for science operations. Scientists should also work with policymakers to strengthen physical and virtual connectivity in the Arctic, while promoting Indigenous Peoples’ control over its use in their communities. Finally, an immediate action must be to ensure that science projects provide emergency relief and long-term support for local contractors, logistics operators, and project participants.
Focusing on the next generation
A prolonged gap in training will undermine the future of Arctic science. But this opportunity allows us to reflect on how scientists of the future might be better trained. The next generation of scientists, whether from southern-based institutions or residents of the North, must be given the opportunity for place-based learning and training. This applies to traditional academic subjects as well as skills essential to the Arctic. It is important to develop programmes, courses, projects, and research opportunities that focus on Indigenous and local communities’ contexts and encourage learning about the social, historical, political, and economic circumstances in the Arctic.
The Arctic to remain an essential arena for global research
The economic and social ramifications of the COVID-19 pandemic are likely to persist for years to come. However, rapidly changing environmental impacts make in situ scientific studies vital to continue furthering our knowledge. Personal experiences in the field, community-driven knowledge co-production, and hands-on learning and teaching remain essential to secure insight for coming generations of Arctic experts, whether local or from outside the region. It is critical that the collective research community continues to build understanding of the Arctic as a grand challenge important to humankind.
Resilient Arctic science in the post-COVID-19 world will be based on a global coalition and meaningful collaboration among scientists, local and Indigenous rights-, stake- and knowledge holders, policymakers, science advocates, citizen scientists, industry partners, research institutions, and funding agencies, among others. Further embracing international cooperation15, fostering community-science and public–private partnerships, and pursuing well-coordinated planning will pave the way to novel, bold global initiatives for Arctic science, such as a new International Polar Year-2033, which, however, should be based on the locally focused principles and priorities.

Parvati Foundation is creating MAPS, the Marine Arctic Peace Sanctuary, to save the Arctic Ocean. For millions of years, since long before humans ever walked on Earth, the Arctic Ocean has been covered with ice and kept our planet cool.
Today, the ice is melting.
You have the right to know that this is a global emergency. All life is at risk.
Why we need to protect the Arctic Ocean
There is an under-reported, global, ecological, and humanitarian crisis that affects us personally, and all life on Earth, right now.
Arctic sea ice is our planet’s air conditioning system. It balances weather patterns globally so that we have the food and resources we need to survive. But it’s under threat as never before from corporations and governments that seek to profit from its melting.
Arctic sea ice reflects half of the sun’s heat away from our planet.
But today, there is 75% less Arctic sea ice in the summer than there was just 50 years ago.
Exposed Arctic water now absorbs 90% of the sun’s heat. Parts of the Arctic Ocean are 4C/7F too hot.
We are inherently and inescapably interconnected. What happens in the Arctic affects all life on Earth. We must act now to protect the Arctic Ocean.
How the Marine Arctic Peace Sanctuary protects the Arctic Ocean
MAPS, the Marine Arctic Peace Sanctuary, is by far the largest marine conservation area in history. It declares the entire Arctic Ocean north of the Arctic Circle an international peace park, free from exploitation of all kinds, in perpetuity. It prohibits all activities harmful to the health of the vulnerable Arctic Ocean ecosystem and its sea ice.
MAPS not only:
- Protects the fragile Arctic Ocean ecosystem, which has been a peace park for thousands of years by its very nature
- Safeguards remaining sea ice from damage by exploitation, helping to keep the planet cool
- Helps prevent natural disasters such as forest fires, floods and droughts
MAPS also:
- Compels a global shift away from fossil fuels to sustainable energy
- Unites world leaders in the commitment to value long-term collective good over short-term individual gain
- Declares our global commitment to sustainable energies and our cessation of the use of fossil fuels by saying “no” to offshore Arctic oil and gas
- Unites world leaders in agreement to no longer put short-term gain ahead of long-term consequence
What we can do to save the Arctic Ocean
The Arctic Ocean sustains us all, but it can only protect us if we protect it. Although exploitation poses a tremendous threat, most people still do not yet realize the melting Arctic ice is a global emergency. For MAPS to be established to save the Arctic Ocean, the world needs to understand why the emergency is so dire for each one of us, and that MAPS will safeguard this endangered ecosystem while catalyzing the needed global shift to sustainability.
Your country’s leader needs to know you want them to sign the MAPS Treaty.
The more signatures appear on the MAPS petition, the more world leaders will be compelled to pay attention. Sign the MAPS Petition now.
How MAPS protects all life
MAPS declares all ocean waters north of the Arctic Circle off limits to commercialization, militarization and industrialization to protect all life. By stilling the frenetic consumption of the Arctic Ocean and taking all Arctic seabed petroleum resources off the table for good, MAPS accelerates the world’s pivot to sustainability and renewable energy. It brings world leaders together to affirm the collective long-term good over short-term individual gain. According to leading biologists, we must protect 50% of our planet to prevent mass extinction. Dr. Jane Goodall, United Nations Messenger of Peace, says, “It is hugely important to establish this proposed sanctuary.”
MAPS is a direct and effective response to our global crisis. The Arctic Ocean is still one of the most pristine regions on Earth. In essence, it has always been an internationally protected area because of its year-round frozen seascape. MAPS is the only global initiative that ameliorates multiple ecological and humanitarian issues with one single, elegant solution. MAPS invites UN member states and all global citizens to exemplify the best of what makes us human — our ability to connect, collaborate and thrive. Unlike the mindset of the past which equated survival with domination, MAPS lights a path for nations of the world to set aside perceived regional differences, recognize the special role of the Arctic Ocean in preserving and nurturing all life on earth, and unite for the benefit of humanity as a whole in declaring the Marine Arctic Peace Sanctuary.

The final deadline for submitting applications is 24 January 2019.,"You can now apply for funding for Arctic projects
The Nordic Council of Ministers’ Arctic Co-operation Programme came into effect on 1 January 2018 and runs until 31 December 2021. It contributes to the Nordic Council of Ministers’ vision of a Nordic Region that lives up to the values of innovation, freedom of movement, visibility, and international engagement. It also supports the Nordic Council of Ministers’ other cross-sectoral strategies based on Nordic strengths and areas where the Nordic Council of Ministers has influence – both in the Nordic Region and globally – and can create added value.
The primary target group of the programme is the Arctic population, with the aim of continuing to contribute to the sustainable and constructive development of the region. Four categories make up the priorities of the programme: planet, people, prosperity, and partnerships. Traditionally, the Nordic Council of Ministers has prioritised the partnership perspective and made efforts to integrate it horizontally into the programme. Such efforts will continue to be a priority.
The programme is administered by Nordregio in co-operation with the Secretariat to the Nordic Council of Ministers. By the end of April 2019, a decision will be made as to which projects will receive funding from the Arctic co-operation programme.
Information about the application round can be found on Nordregio’s website. Applications must be sent electronically to Nordregio by 24 January 2019.
You can find information about the application round here. (Nordregio.org)
The work of the Nordic Council of Ministers, including the Arctic co-operation programme, is rooted in the Nordic countries’ tradition of entitlement to and legal and historical tradition for democracy and inclusion.

Climate change is transforming the region, opening up new maritime routes and facilitating the use of underwater resources. It can be noted that in recent years, the confrontation in the Arctic has significantly increased. There are several reasons for this, the main one is the uncertain status of borders in this region, as well as its importance in the strategic plan:
Energy and resources
So far, no one knows exactly how much wealth the Arctic holds. According to calculations by the US Department of energy, up to 13% of undiscovered oil reserves and a large number of gas fields are located under icy waters. In addition to hydrocarbons, the Arctic has significant reserves of Nickel ores, rare earth metals, tin, tungsten, gold and diamonds.
According to some estimates, the Arctic contains 30 percent of the world’s natural gas reserves and strategically important deposits of rare earth metals worth more than a trillion US dollars.
Logistics
In the modern world, the value is not only raw resources, but also the communications and logistics through which they are delivered. There are two major transoceanic routes in the Arctic: the Northern sea route (Hereinafter NSR – Auth.) and the Northwest passage, which connects the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.
The richness of the Arctic latitudes is almost completely offset by the climatic conditions of this region. The nature of the Arctic is extremely hostile to man. Most of the year, the Northern sea route is covered with ice. The cost of mining is so high that the development of most fields is not profitable at the moment.
However, due to global warming, the situation in the Arctic is changing. The ice is gradually melting, which opens up access to resources and increases the attractiveness of Arctic transport routes. There are well-founded forecasts that by the end of this century there will be no ice in the Arctic ocean at all, and this will make the NSR free for navigation all year round.
Going along the Arctic coast of Russia The Northern sea route significantly reduces the passage time of ships between East Asian and European ports compared to existing routes passing through the Strait of Malacca.
These facts put the issue of “the registration of the Arctic`s residence” on the agenda of many leading countries of the world.
The Arctic is the most important strategic region and the North polar region of the globe, which covers the entire Arctic ocean, adjacent parts of the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, as well as the edges of the continents of Eurasia and North America within the Arctic circle. This zone includes the territories of 6 Arctic states: Russia, the United States, Canada, Denmark, Norway and Iceland. Two other states – Sweden and Finland – have territories beyond the Arctic circle, but do not have access to the coastline of the Arctic ocean.
It is worth noting that significant interest in the Arctic is also shown by those states which territories are very remote from it, namely China, India, Japan, and South Korea. In particular, South Korea and China maintains its leadership in scientific programs to study the Arctic and builds gas carriers for Russian Arctic projects. Asian shipping companies are actively showing themselves in using the Northern sea route. In addition, Saudi Aramco (Saudi Arabia) closed a deal to join the Russian Arctic LNG – 2 project in 2019. China, in turn, is actively engaged in investment activities in the region and the implementation of the Arctic Silk Road.
Thus, illustrative examples clearly demonstrate the fact that many countries of the world are attracted by the prospects for developing the oil and gas potential of the Arctic continental shelf, fresh water reserves and the possibility of reducing transcontinental transport routes that may serve their national interests.
It should be understood that according to international law, each country has the right to use underwater resources at a distance of 200 miles from its coast. However, there is a UN Convention that states that if a country can prove that the ocean shelf is an extension of its continental platform, it will be considered its property. In this regard, the territorial Arctic issue is becoming quite relevant. Thus, Russia believes that the Lomonosov underwater ridge is a continuation of the Siberian platform. In this case, 1.2 million square km of shelf with huge reserves of hydrocarbons fall under Russian jurisdiction. Such statement in redistricting borders is not supported by other Arctic States (Iceland; Denmark; Sweden; Canada; Norway; USA; Finland). This position of the Russian side also raises concerns in China, India and the UK. These countries interpret international legislation in a completely different way, claiming vast areas of the Arctic shelf:
- Canada believes that the Lomonosov ridge is an extension of its territory and promises to prove this fact in the UN;
- The Lomonosov ridge is also claimed by Norway, which has already achieved the transfer of part of the shelf under its jurisdiction;
- The United States considers its own section of the shelf near Alaska and is also collecting evidence;
- China supports the collective use of the region’s resources, which will open up access to the region for Chinese TNCs and activate the Arctic Silk Road.
It is believed that the requirement that unites almost all members of the Arctic Council is international control over the Northern sea route. Currently, Canada, the United States, Norway and Russia have adopted state programs for the development of the Arctic. However, the approaches to the division and development of the region among the member countries of the Arctic Council are largely contradictory.
China also began to show increased attention to the Arctic. This country is an observer in the Arctic Council, and in 2013, China adopted a state program for the development of the region. It provides for the construction of its own significant ice-breaking fleet. Since 1994, North sea sails, the Chinese icebreaker “Snow dragon” made already several passages on NSR.
Analyzing the confrontation of geopolitical interests in the Arctic region, we should note the main Arctic powers and their military capabilities:
1) Russia is the owner of the largest Arctic coast, the Arctic water sector, and the largest continental shelf;
2) NATO, this organization includes five countries (USA, Canada, Norway, Iceland and Denmark) with coasts and territorial waters in the Arctic;
3) China does not have a coast and territorial waters in the Arctic, but by increasing its economic and, as a result, military power (including, first of all, a large military fleet under construction) may try to join the division of the international Arctic shelf – most likely by joining one of the two sides (Russia or NATO).
Today, many experts point to Russia’s superiority over the West in the number of icebreakers and Russia’s military advantage in the Arctic. But icebreakers are not warships, the main military importance in the Arctic are: 1) a military fleet that can be quickly transferred to the Arctic ocean from the Pacific or Atlantic; 2) aviation, including strategic; 3) air defense systems. It is noted that today Russia is strengthening its military grouping and tools of transferring troops in the region, as well as taking under joint Russian – Chinese control key sea routes.
China’s military capabilities in the Arctic region are generally more modest and are limited to a fleet that is also potentially armed with naval missile weapons capable of carrying tactical nuclear charges. China’s aviation today is limited by its attachment to aircraft carriers, the number of which China intends to significantly increase in the future.
Without leveling cooperation with Russia in the military sphere in the region, China actively involves economic tools of influence in the Arctic. Thus,in June 2017, the state Committee for development and reform and the State Oceanographic administration of China named the Arctic as one of the directions of the “One belt, One road” project. The “Concept of cooperation at sea within the framework of the BRI” refers to the need to involve Chinese companies in the commercial use of Arctic transport routes.
In January 2018, the state Council of China published the first “White paper on China’s Arctic policy”, which states that Beijing is interested party in Arctic Affairs. It was noted that China intends to create, jointly with other States, the sea trade routes in the Arctic region within the framework of the “Polar Silk Road initiative”. Thus, it was decided that the Polar Silk Road will be part of the broader Chinese “Belt and Road” program, creating sea trade routes and strengthening trade relations with different countries in the region.
It should be noted that in the Arctic strategy of NATO, in contrast to the strategies of other countries, the power component is most clearly traced, and the desire for sole leadership in the Arctic is demonstrated. The combined expenditures of the United States and Canada to expand their military presence in the Arctic over the past 6 years have increased dramatically, while Denmark and Norway have increased by at least 20 percent. In the American and Canadian Arctic sectors new military installations, points of the body and signals intelligence continue to be created.
The head of the US Commission on Arctic research, M. Treadwell, once pointed out that the accessible Arctic means new and expanded routes for American naval transport, and the emergence of aircraft, missiles and missile defense has made the Arctic region an important point for demonstrating power and an advanced area for ensuring the security of North America, Asia and Europe.
According to a report of the US Congressional Research Center, by 2022, the Pentagon intends to replace the F-16 fighters, which belong to the 11th air force stationed in Alaska, with new F – 35S. NATO allies will also be obliged to rearm. Thus, Norway is going to put into service American fifth-generation fighters in the number of 52 aircraft. Norway, in addition to the military confrontation with Russia, continues to develop transport infrastructure and, perhaps, in 2021, the railway connecting the mining areas of Finland with the Norwegian coast will be finally approved.
In November 2018, the largest NATO training in the post – Soviet era in the Arctic region, Trident Juncture 2018 (with the participation of more than 50,000 military personnel and large air and naval forces), took place near the Russian border. It also involved an aircraft carrier strike group led by the aircraft carrier Harry Truman, which interrupted its preparations for a mission in the Persian Gulf. In addition, U.S. Secretary of the Navy R. Spencer also underlined that the issue of creating a strategic port in the Bering sea is being studied. He stressed that this would be a nationwide project that would involve the US Navy, the US Coast guard and private companies.
At the time, British defense Minister G. Williamson emphasized that the UK should increase its military power in the Arctic and called this region “London’s own backyard”. It was immediately supported by the UK Parliament’s defense Committee, which reacted as follows: “NATO’s renewed focus on the North Atlantic is welcome, and the government should be congratulated for the leadership that the UK has shown on this issue”.
Thus, based on the above, we can predict that the relations within the China – Russia – US triangle on “the Arctic issues” are likely to be more complex and confrontational, since they are associated with countries’ desire to achieve “freedom of hands” and a leader’s position in solving many political problems, bypassing international organizations, and sometimes international law.
Analyzing the international situation on “the Arctic issue”, it should be emphasized that the Arctic can become the largest storehouse of energy resources and a key transport hub of the globe – this is the prospect of the near future, this is the prospect of the XXI century. The maritime route from Europe to Asia via the Arctic is much shorter than the Suez canal. From London to Shanghai, the South sea is 11,865 nautical miles, and the North sea is 8814nm.
Due to its special geographical location, large reserves of natural resources, defense, scientific, and environmental significance, the Arctic is a place where many countries’ interests intersect. Thus, tensions between the leading countries are increasing all over the world and will inevitably flow to the Arctic. Issues of sovereignty and freedom of navigation in the Arctic are becoming more relevant as sea traffic volumes increase and economic rates increase. Little-known in the past maritime routes such as the Bering Strait can become extremely important passages – a kind of Persian Gulf of the future. In this regard, it can also seen that whoever controls the Arctic will largely control the world economy and the new international strategic corridor.",,Maria Smotrytska,Intelligence,,2021-02-03,Modern Diplomacy

“Exceptional and prolonged” temperatures in Siberia, have left parts of the Arctic warmer than sub-tropical Florida, and fuelled “devastating” wildfires for a second consecutive year, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) said on Friday, while warning also of rapidly decreasing sea ice along the Russian polar coast.
According to the UN agency, temperatures in Siberia have been more than 5C above average from January to June, and in June up to 10C above average.
“Some parts of #Siberia this week have again topped 30 degrees Celsius – so it’s been warmer in Siberia than many parts of Florida. This should not be happening.” -- @WMO spokesperson briefs @UNGeneva press corps. pic.twitter.com/hIIXKRXSg7 — UN Geneva (@UNGeneva) July 24, 2020
“Some parts of Siberia this week have again topped 30 degrees Celsius – so it’s been warmer in Siberia than…many parts of Florida”, said WMO spokesperson Clare Nullis at a press conference in Geneva.
“We’ve had exceptional and prolonged heat for months now and this has fuelled devastating Arctic fires; and at the same time we’re seeing rapidly decreasing sea coverage along the Arctic coast”, she continued, noting that their estimated total carbon emissions since January are the highest in 18 years, when the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service of wildfires began.
The development follows an astonishing reading of 38°C in the Russian town of Verkhoyansk on 20 June.
This has been confirmed by the Russian Federal Service for Hydrometeorological and Environmental Monitoring (Roshydromet); WMO is in the process of establishing a committee to assess that decision.
The cause of the prolonged furnace-like conditions, is the “blocking” action of a vast weather front over the Arctic, along with a “persistent northward swing of the jet stream” which has been sending warm air into the region, journalists heard.
“The Arctic is heating more than twice as fast as the global average, impacting local populations and ecosystems and with global repercussions”, Ms. Nullis said, adding that such extreme heat would have been almost impossible without the influence of human-induced climate change.
Worrying footage of the forest fires close to the ocean have underscored the need for urgent climate action by nations and greater commitment to achieving the pledges made in the Paris Climate Agreement, the WMO spokesperson insisted, including efforts to limit global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels.
Data from Wednesday showed 188 probable points of fire in Siberia, according to Roshydromet, with blazes particularly intense in Russia’s Sakha Republic and Chukotka Autonomous Okrug, in the far northeast of Siberia.
Both areas have experienced much warmer conditions than usual in past months. Russian authorities have also declared that there is an extreme fire hazard throughout the Khanty-Mansiysk Autonomous Okrug – Yugra which is in western Siberia, WMO reported.
Wildfire smoke contains pollutants including carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxide, volatile organic compounds and solid aerosol particles, the UN agency said in a statement, which noted that Arctic wildfires emitted the equivalent of 56 megatonnes of carbon dioxide in June, compared to 53 megatonnes in June 2019.
“We’re seeing, you know, dramatic satellite images, which show the extent of the burns surface; the fire front of the northern-most currently active Arctic wildfire is less than eight kilometres from the Arctic ocean – this should not be happening,” Ms. Nullis said.
Highlighting new climate research published in the journal Nature Climate Change pointing to irreversible threats to the Arctic ecosystem, the WMO spokesperson said that “polar bears - which as we all know is a symbol of climate change - could be nearly extinct by the end of the century”, if sea ice continues to shrink at current rates.
Accelerating ice retreat along the Arctic Russian coast in the spring, has accelerated since late June, leading to very low sea ice extent in the Laptev and Barents Seas, WMO also warned.
“The Northern Sea route appears to be nearly open”. it added.
Changes to weather at the poles will likely affect other more distant and populated places too, Ms. Nullis cautioned, thanks to a phenomenon known as “teleconnections”.
These are observed in weather events including El Nino, where cold and dry air reaches places that are more used to seeing warmer, wetter conditions.
“In general, the Arctic is heating more than twice the global average”, Ms. Nullis said. “It’s having a big impact on local populations and ecosystems, but we always say that what happens in the Arctic doesn’t stay in the Arctic, it does affect our weather in different parts of the world where hundreds of millions of people live.”",,Esa,,,2020-07-10,UN News

Region I is the most northerly OSPAR region, characterised by its harsh climate and ice coverage although the ecosystems of this region are still rich. In spite of its low population density, human activities such as fishing and offshore petroleum production remain significant.
Region I constitutes approximately 40% of the OSPAR maritime area. The region is characterised by a relatively harsh climate with extreme variations in light, temperature and ice cover. The flow of oceanic water through Region I is dominated by the so called ""Global Conveyor Belt"" with warmer surface water arriving in the region in the east, sinking at high latitudes and dense cold deep water flowing southward through the Denmark Strait in the west.
Region I has a very low population density inhabited by a total population of 2.6 million. As a result, impacts of human activities related to settlements are relatively small and mostly local although there are significant fishing and petroleum industries in this region. The offshore industry is of importance both in the Norwegian and Russian sectors of Region I and ocean fisheries are significant in Iceland, The Faroe Islands, Norway and the north-western part of the Russian Federation.
In Region I there are six species of fish that support the major fisheries in the Nordic and Barents Sea: cod, saithe, haddock, blue whiting, herring and capelin. Importantly, major spawning grounds for these and other commercially important fish exist along the continental shelves along the Nordic countries. The European Arctic is also one of the most abundant seabird regions in the world with a breeding population of more than 25 million surface feeders (such as gulls, or fulmars) and pursuit diving subsurface feeders (such as Brünnich's guillemot).
In parts of Region I ice-cover occurs seasonally. The ice and ice-melt have a large influence on ecological conditions. The melting of the ice in spring and summer typically coincides with a sudden increase in light and a resultant burst of plant growth in the form of an ice edge bloom. This supports large populations of fish, marine mammals and birds.
A number of whale species are found in Region I including: minke whale, fin whale, blue whale, pilot whale and sperm whale, northern right whale and bowhead whale. Six species of seal, as well as the walrus, are found in the region: the common harbour seal, the grey seal, the harp seal, the hooded seal, the ringed seal and the bearded seal.",,,,,2021-04-26,OSPAR Commission

If the trend continued, Arctic routes could be used more reliably, at least during the summer months and for longer periods of time.
The North Sea route to the Arctic coast of Russia is likely to be ice-free and would reduce sea travel between Europe and East Asia from 24,000 kilometres, using the Suez Canal, to 13,600 km, thus reducing transit time by 10-15 days.
Furthermore, the Northwest Passage through the Canadian Arctic Ocean could become usable on a regular basis within the next few years, thus reducing shipping distances significantly.
Instead, the sea voyage between East Asia and Western Europe requires to travel 24,000 kilometres, also through the Panama Canal.
The Northeast Passage is the shortest sea route from Europe to Asia. Its only disadvantage is that it is located in an icy area for a period of about six months a year and cannot be crossed. This, however, seems to be changing. Global warming is changing the rules of the game, opening up new and – in some cases – unexpected opportunities for freight transport.
The increasing use of this hitherto neglected route provides many opportunities for commercial shipping. The Arctic and subarctic sea route is also considered to be the shortest sea passage between the Pacific Ocean and the Atlantic Ocean.
Arctic routes can save much time and fuel, as well as reduce fuel waste emissions, which is particularly important in an era of fierce competition between shipping companies and of ever increasing attention paid to environmental issues and ecology.
A further advantage is that this route allows ships to circumvent areas where piracy is rampant (such as the Straits of Malacca and the Red Sea region).
There are certainly many advantages, but also a major disadvantage. The route is only used by a relatively small number of ships. There are more ships passing through the Suez Canal every day than those sailing along the route between the Barents Sea and the Bering Strait.
The reason is simple: due to frost, ships can only navigate between early July and late November. Even in this short period of time the route is complicated; Russia charges taxes for crossing the territorial waters and you need to use icebreakers to clear the way in difficult weather conditions.
This entails additional costs. Moreover, fast climate change, sudden ice formations and irregular icebergs can also cause severe problems.
Since the infrastructure in Russia’s Northern ports has been in poor condition since the collapse of the Soviet Union, emergency situations could endanger ships.
Owing to global warming, this relatively short time window for traffic would become longer in the coming decades. In the past decades, the size and thickness of the Arctic ice cap have shrunk significantly. On August 29, 2008, the Northeast and Northwest Passages were even free of ice for the first time. Since then, the ice cap has further shrunk and thinned.
For example, an Asian icebreaker conducted a research expedition from the Pacific to the North Atlantic in August 2012. It encountered less ice than expected and the return journey took less time than the outward journey.
In the future the Northeast Passage could be completely ice-free in summer. From a historical viewpoint, this region has always been considered a harsh environment and its development is an important pioneering achievement.
As early as the 12th century, the Russians set off for Eastern Siberia by navigating in sight of the coastline. In the 16th and 17th centuries, the Netherlands, Great Britain, Sweden and Denmark often tried to find another way to Asia, but they never succeeded.
It was only in 1878-79 that the Swedish explorer, Adolf Erik Nordenskiöld (1832-1901), made an expedition with the sailing ship Vega, leaving from Göteborg to the Bering Strait, sailing along the Northern coasts of the whole Eurasia and solving once and for all the problem of the Northeast Passage. Previously, in 1875 and in 1876, he had only managed to reach the mouth of the Yenisey river and was forced to come back because of ice.
Strictly speaking, however, it is not really correct to call it a success – at least from a theoretically commercial viewpoint–as the ship Vega was blocked by ice and trapped in the Bering Strait for ten months.
It was only in 1932 that the Soviet icebreaker Aleksandr Sibirjakov made his first successful passage in a single season. In the summer of 1967, that route was finally opened to the international shipping industry.
Later, before the collapse of the USSR caused a sharp drop in the volume of shipments in the Northeast Passage, nuclear-powered icebreakers cleared the route and enabled ships to transit (at the latest since 1987, 331 times).
In 2009, the Bremen transport and shipping company was the first to use that route again with two cargo ships, thus causing a sensation. According to the shipping company, the two icebreakers leaving Vladivostok at the end of summer 2009 were both class E3 – therefore suitable for sailing through the North Pole.
In September 2018, the Danish container ship Venta Maersk crossed the Northeast Passage in 37 days: It was the first container ship to do so. As it is a large container ship, its class is 1A (it can cross up to one-metre thick ice). It is specially designed with a reinforced hull for being used in cold water (minimum -25°C).
The maiden voyage of the Venta Maersk revealed a serious flaw, so it is unlikely that a large 40,000-ton container ship will sail along this route in the near future. The problem was that some parts of the route have a draught of only 11 metres, which is too low for a large container ship.
The cargo carrying capacity of the Venta Maersk is usually less than 3,600 TEU, but the shallow water means that it can only hold 600 refrigerated containers.
The construction of large container ships does not meet ice breaking standards, and is also constrained by more unfavourable factors such as length. Hence the Northeast Passage will never be comparable to the Suez Canal in terms of transport volume.
Great progress is currently being made in the construction of flexible cargo ships capable of crossing ice and cope with difficult environments without icebreakers clearing the way to them. This type of vessel can be used for certain types of goods that cannot take longer traditional routes.
Although it will take time, the global economy is expected to reap many potential benefits from shorter supply routes to production sites and sales markets in Europe and Asia.
Crossing the Arctic Ocean risks becoming a decisive factor in the fierce price war between major shipping companies.
However, environmentalists have warned against the damage caused by increased traffic. They fear that this will have a lasting negative impact on the extremely sensitive Arctic ecosystem.
Moreover, the more ships on the route, the greater the risk of severe accidents in this region rich in natural resources.
However, the world’s joint efforts to tackle global warming will put an end to such plans before then. A case in point is the expedition of the German research icebreaker Polarstern, which started on September 20, 2019 and came to an end this autumn.
The MOSAiC research (Multidisciplinary Drift Observatory for Arctic Climate Research) was conducted by the Alfred-Wegener-Institut Helmholtz-Zentrum fuer Polar und Meeresforschung.
The results of MOSAiC will contribute to a better understanding of the regional and global consequences of Arctic climate change and sea ice loss and will improve weather and climate forecasting, as well as the opportunities of exploiting this potential economic and trade route in the future.",,Giancarlo Elia Valori,Economy,,2020-12-08,Modern Diplomacy

Preface
Norway’s Arctic policy revolves around security, stability and interest-based international cooperation. For us, foreign and domestic policy converge in the Arctic.
Climate change presents unprecedented global challenges with a particularly strong impact in the Arctic, but this is also accompanied by widespread opportunities for reform and adaptation to a new reality. However, international cooperation is under pressure and protectionism is on the rise. And now, and for some time to come, the multi- layered crisis caused by the corona pandemic will have an impact on all areas of social, economic and political cooperation – in the Arctic as well.
This white paper gives broad consideration to domestic policy issues in the Arctic. North Norway accounts for 35 % of Norway’s mainland territory, and 9 % of Norway’s population lives north of the Arctic Circle. Responsible economic growth and future-oriented jobs in the north are therefore a matter of national interest. Considering Norway’s geopolitical location, this also has strategic sig- nificance beyond the demographics. Further developing North Norway as a strong, dynamic and highly competent region is the best way to safeguard Norwegian interests in the Arctic.
Since the early 1970s, urbanisation has led to a relative population decrease in the north compared to the rest of the country, and the last few years have seen a net population decline in North Norway. Dealing with this, and possibly reversing it, will require abandoning traditional approaches that have failed to deliver and seeking new solutions instead.
Resilient towns and municipalities, sustainable business development, infrastructure, competence-building and security are vital to succeed in maintaining a strong region. Sami culture is a valuable part of our national historical heritage in the north and an important component in our Arctic policy. These factors are important to the future and opportunities for young people north of the Arctic Circle. Input from the youth panel established in connection with this white paper is reflected throughout the document.
While the growing international interest in the Arctic creates new opportunities for Norwegian cooperation, it also presents a number of challenges. The Norwegian Government will continue to emphasise the importance of the rule of law and strong multilateral structures. There is a well-functioning legal regime in place in the Arctic. The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea provides the fundamental framework, for instance as regards envi- ronmental protection, research, the delimitation of the outer limits of the continental shelf, and shipping. Norway supports cooperation with non-Arctic states based on respect for international law and within the framework of existing cooperation structures.
Nato is the cornerstone of Norway’s security and our defence and deterrence policy is based on effective national defence and the guarantee of Allied reinforcements in the event of war or crisis.
The white paper underlines the importance of bilateral, regional and multilateral cooperation with our neighbours and partners in the Arctic. The Arctic Council, the Barents Euro-Arctic Council, the Council of Baltic Sea States, the Northern Dimension and the EU’s cross-border pro- grammes provide a solid architecture for dialogue and practical cooperation.
The impacts of climate change in the Arctic are affecting countries both in and outside the region. The UN Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Agreement provide the overall direction for Norway’s Arctic policy. We must find a good balance between the exploitation and protec- tion of living marine resources. As maritime nations, the Arctic states have a special responsibility to take action to ensure healthy and productive oceans.
A successful Arctic policy will depend on experience, understanding and facts, and this white paper is based on over a hundred conversations with relevant stake- holders. The Arctic remains Norway’s most important area of strategic responsibility, and the Government will work to maintain its established security policy, promote observant diplomacy and cultivate a strong, innovative and sustainable North Norway. Our political choices in the north will be founded on presence, vigilance and knowledge.

1. Introduction
1.1 Overarching goals
Norway’s Arctic policy focuses on the international picture, relations with neighbouring countries in the Barents region, the northernmost regions of Finland, Norway and Sweden (known in Nordic countries as the North Calotte), and the development of North Norway. Further developing North Norway as a strong, dynamic and highly competent region is the best way to safeguard Norwegian interests in the Arctic. The region is rich in natural resources that contribute to economic growth for the country as a whole, and the economy and social development of this region are therefore a matter of national importance.
Norway’s Arctic policy is based on a long tradition of safeguarding Norway’s interests in the north through broad-based international cooperation. The Arctic will continue to be Norway’s most important area of strategic responsibility. The Government will maintain its engagement in broad-based, proactive international coopera- tion in the north and in global arenas where the Arctic is discussed. This includes facilitating cross-border local and regional cooperation in the north.
Some 9 % of Norway’s population lives north of the Arctic Circle, a greater proportion than in any other country in the world. North Norway accounts for 35 % of Norway’s mainland territory. The region is home to some of Norway’s leading academic and research institutions in areas such as marine research, fisheries and natural resource management, climate change and environmental research, Arctic innovation and sustainable ocean-based industries. For many Norwegians, the Arctic provides both a home and a livelihood.
The white paper does not provide a list of all political initiatives or measures that could conceivably be relevant for or in the Arctic. The Government’s aims and ambitions in the white paper will therefore also be followed up in future sectoral and budgetary processes.
The input on which the white paper is based has largely been obtained through dialogue with counties, municipalities, the Sámediggi (Sami parliament) and key stakeholders from the business sector, and various organisations and knowledge institutions in the north. A dedicated youth panel, set up in connection with the preparation of the white paper, has provided a report with recommendations. All these partners have given their perspectives on key challenges and opportunities in the north.
1.2 Definitions
The Arctic: In the white paper, ‘the Arctic’ refers to the sea and land areas between the North Pole and the Arctic Circle. This is the most common definition of the Arctic (for practical reasons, we have chosen to follow the county boundary and have included the whole of Nordland county in our definition). Within the Arctic, there are large differences in terms of population density, business activities, and access to the open sea.
The High North: The term ‘High North’ has its origins in the policy initiatives that were implemented under the two previous white papers on this region and a number of related strategy documents. In geographical terms, the ‘High North’ refers to the land and sea areas between southern Helgeland in the south to the Greenland Sea in the west and the Pechora Sea (the southeastern corner of the Barents Sea) in the east. This term has mainly been used in a geopolitical context and is closely associated with efforts to safeguard Norwegian interests through various initiatives and cross-border cooperation in the North Calotte region and the Barents region as a whole.
North Norway: Traditionally, Norway’s northernmost region has not been referred to as the Arctic, but it is now established practice to refer to North Norway as part of both the Arctic and the High North. Due to the Gulf Stream, the climatic conditions in the Norwegian part of the Arctic, including temperature and ice cover, differ widely from those in other parts of the region.
In the white paper, Svalbard is mentioned in cases where this has relevance for our capabilities on the mainland, for example in the areas of polar and ocean research, meteorology and emergency preparedness. The Government’s Svalbard policy is set out in a separate white paper.
1.3 The main features of Norway’s Arctic policy in the years ahead
Maintaining a consistent and predictable approach:In light of the increasingly complex foreign and security policy situation in the north, it is essential for us to maintain a consistent and predictable approach and a strong and cred- ible defence in cooperation with our allies and partners. The significance of security and defence in the Arctic is increasing, and strengthening Norway’s defence capability in the north is a priority for the Government. A substantial part of the Norwegian Armed Forces’ operational structure is located in the region. Norway has a long tradition of successfully balancing its various interests in the north.
Highlighting the benefits of cooperation: The growing inter- national interest in the Arctic has led to a greater tendency to focus predominantly on the various competing interests, while cooperation forums that have functioned well for decades are being overlooked or described as outdated. The Government will encourage Norwegian knowledge institutions to continue to play a part in ensuring that the international debate about the Arctic is based on facts and sound analyses, not on myths. In this way, Norwegian research and knowledge communities can participate in the efforts to promote Norwegian interests in the north. Promoting respect for international law: The Arctic is some- times portrayed as an unregulated or even lawless region. The impacts of the melting of the Arctic ice on countries outside the region are cited by some as a reason to view developments in the Arctic as a shared global concern (‘what happens in the Arctic doesn’t stay in the Arctic’). This is being used as an argument for giving non-Arctic states a general right to participate in the management of the Arctic. The rights, interests and options available to non-Arctic states vary depending on what they are seeking to achieve in the different areas of jurisdiction. There is consensus among the members of the Arctic Council that international law applies in the Arctic.
Taking a broad-based approach to climate change and the environment in the Arctic: The rapid warming of the Arctic is endangering Arctic species and ecosystems that are dependent on ice and snow, and also poses a threat to local communities and the way of life and culture of indigenous peoples. The rising temperature in the Arctic is primarily due to the increase in global greenhouse gas emissions, not to human activity in the region. This underscores the importance of the Paris Agreement and the need for follow-up and implementation. The Government will take steps to restructure the Norwegian economy and facilitate Norway’s transformation into a low-carbon society by the middle of this century, and will continue to assist other countries in their efforts to cut emissions.
Working towards the UN Sustainable Development Goals: The SDGs provide the overall direction for Norway’s Arctic policy. In addition, North Norway has both resources and expertise of relevance to the EU’s European Green Deal, including in the areas of blue-green technology and green transformation. This will be important for businesses and employment levels both in Norway and in other European countries in the years ahead. The Government’s ocean policy focuses on global leadership, clean and productive oceans, business development, knowledge and technology, and sound management.
Promoting job creation and value creation are overarching goals of Norway’s domestic Arctic policy. However, this white paper is being presented in the midst of a global health and economic crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic. The crisis is putting pressure on public finances, but has also highlighted the need to accelerate the process of restructuring the economy.
The Government will promote closer cooperation between the business community and the higher education sector, with a view to creating attractive jobs in the north. In this context, it is important to expand cooperation with the other Nordic countries, which rank high internationally in research and innovation-based business development.
Europe is a major market for the Norwegian aquaculture and fisheries sector, and virtually the entire industry in North Norway has stressed the vital importance of the EEA Agreement for ensuring food security and access to the European market for Norwegian seafood.
Norway must address fundamental challenges relating to continuing population decline in North Norway. New solutions are needed, as is a strong focus on fostering viable communities in the north. The Government will promote the development of environmentally-friendly towns and cities across the country that provide a good quality of life for people and good conditions for businesses. With this in mind, the Government has initiated work on a national strategy for small cities and urban centres.
Promoting and supporting the development of a diverse cultural and sports sector has always been a key element of the efforts to ensure that North Norway is an attractive place to live. Raising awareness of the history of North Norway as part of our national cultural heritage, from antiquity to thousand-year-old, coastal trading routes to the Second World War and the post-war reconstruction years, is an important part of this work.
Being at the forefront of technological development: Technological development continues to be a key goal of Norway’s Arctic policy, and is vital for reaching all our goals in the north. Norway is well placed to make use of new technologies in areas where we already have cutting-edge expertise, such as health, energy, petroleum, maritime and marine industries, and the public sector. In North Norway, better access to data on the oceans, space, climate change and health will open up new opportunities for promoting the sustainable use of natural resources and increasing value creation.
Preserving the identity and culture of national indigenous communities: Indigenous issues are a priority in Norway’s Arctic policy. Sami culture is a valuable part of our national historical heritage. In recent years, Sami art and culture have received growing attention and recognition both nationally and internationally. The Government will explore new ways of strengthening Sami culture, cultural industries and tourism, in consultation with the Sámediggi. This may have positive spin-off effects on job creation and value creation across the country. As an indigenous people, the Sami have a right to be consulted in matters that could affect them directly. Promoting Kven/Norwegian Finn identity and culture: The Kvens/Norwegian Finns have long ties to Norway and have left their mark on the historical development of the Arctic. Today, Kven organisations and communities are working to revitalise Kven language and culture. The Kven language is recognised as a minority language in Norway. The Government will facilitate the preservation of the Kven language and Kven/Norwegian Finn culture and society.
2. The international legal framework
International law applies in the Arctic just as it does else- where in the world. The 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea constitutes the basic international legal framework for all maritime activity, including in the Arctic. In order to achieve the Arctic states’ common goal of maintaining stability and predictability in the region, it is essential that all states respect international law.
Most global treaties and instruments apply in the Arctic. National sovreignty is undisputed in almost all areas of the Arctic. Only a few sea areas are beyond national jurisdiction. The Arctic is a peaceful region in which states display a willingness to cooperate and to resolve contentious issues in accordance with the principles of international law.
2.1 The Law of the Sea
The Ilulissat Declaration adopted in 2008 by the five coastal states around the central Arctic Ocean – Canada, Denmark, Norway, Russia and the US – confirmed that the Law of the Sea provides the framework for managing activities in the Arctic Ocean. This ministerial declaration played an important role in clarifying the international legal frame- work in the Arctic, for instance as regards environmental protection, research, the delimitation of the outer limits of the continental shelf, and shipping. The coastal states reaffirmed their commitment to the orderly settlement of possible overlapping claims to maritime areas. The fact that the Law of the Sea applies in the central Arctic Ocean provides a basis for orderly, predictable relations between the coastal states.
In the decades ahead, a reduction in the ice cover may make fishing activities possible in the central Arctic Ocean. In October 2018, the Agreement to prevent unregulated high seas fisheries in the Central Arctic Ocean was signed by the five coastal states surrounding the central Arctic Ocean and five distant water fishing nations and entities – the EU, China, Iceland, Japan and South Korea. The agreement does not prohibit fishing in the international part of the Arctic Ocean, but the parties undertake not to permit their vessels to fish in that area until international conservation and management measures have been established.
A number of global agreements relating to fisheries, shipping and the marine environment specify rights and duties in all maritime areas. These also apply in the Arctic. The 1995 United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement sets out detailed rules on fisheries management beyond the 200-mile zones. It also sets out principles for the conservation and management of fish stocks, such as the precautionary approach. The agreement attaches importance to subregional and regional mechanisms for cooperation on fisheries management in international waters.
The Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic (the Ospar Convention), which was adopted in 1992, provides a comprehensive framework for protection of the marine environment, including in parts of the Arctic.
Negotiations are ongoing in the UN on a new international legally binding instrument under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biodiversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction. This agreement will also be relevant for the Arctic. The process aims to strengthen the framework for international marine management by establishing rules for the use of area-based management tools, including marine protected areas and environmental impact assessments. Norway is working to ensure that the agreement is based on the existing Law of the Sea architecture, and that it complements other sectorial and regional mechanisms such as those of the international Maritime Organization (IMO), the North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission (NEAFC), the Ospar Commission, the North Atlantic Marine Mammal Commission (Nammco) and the Arctic Council.
2.2 Norway’s sea areas
Norway’s 200-mile zones
Under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, Norway has sovereign rights to explore, exploit, conserve and manage living and non-living natural resources in a zone extending up to 200 nautical miles from its baselines.
Norway established a 200-nautical-mile exclusive economic zone off the mainland coast in 1976. In 1977, in accordance with the Act of 17 December 1976 relating to the Economic Zone of Norway, a fisheries protection zone was established around Svalbard. The fisheries zone around Jan Mayen was established in 1980.
The Norwegian continental shelf
Norway exercises sovereign rights over its continental shelf for the purposes of exploring and exploiting natural resources. No one may exploit petroleum or mineral deposits or sedentary species on the Norwegian continental shelf without Norway’s consent.
The Norwegian continental shelf extends at least as far as 200 nautical miles from the mainland, Svalbard and Jan Mayen. In the Banana Hole, the Loophole and the area north of Svalbard, the Norwegian continental shelf extends beyond 200 nautical miles. The Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf in New York confirmed this in its recommendation in 2009.
Maritime delimitation
In cases where a state’s exclusive economic zone and/ or the continental shelf overlaps with those of another state, delimitation agreements are needed. In the Arctic, Norway has entered into delimitation agreements with Iceland, Denmark (Greenland) and Russia. Norway has also signed agreements with Iceland and Denmark (the Faroe Islands) on the delimitation of the continental shelf in the Banana Hole.
In 1980, following extensive negotiations, an agreement was concluded with Iceland on the establishment of a Conciliation Commission on the Continental Shelf area between Iceland and Jan Mayen. The subsequent delimitation agreement was signed in 1981.
Negotiations with Denmark on delimitation of the area between Jan Mayen and Greenland were conducted from 1980 to 1988, when Denmark brought the case before the International Court of Justice. The Court began the process of delimitation by drawing a provisional median line that basically divided the disputed area down the middle, but then adjusted this to take account of the marked difference in the lengths of the coasts of Greenland and Jan Mayen. The result was that Norway received 57 % of the disputed area, while Denmark received 43 %. The subsequent agreement on maritime delimitation was signed in 1995.
In 1997, the delimitation of a small sea area between Jan Mayen, Greenland and Iceland was agreed, following negotiations between the parties. With this, the entire extent of the fisheries zone around Jan Mayen was settled. In 2006, an agreement was concluded between Norway and Denmark together with the Home Rule Government of Greenland on the delimitation of the continental shelf and the fisheries zones in the area between Greenland and Svalbard.
In October 2019, Norway signed two agreements, with Iceland and Denmark/the Faroe Islands respectively, on delimitation of the continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles in the southern part of the Banana Hole.
The maritime boundary with Russia in the Varangerfjord area was agreed between Norway and the Soviet Union in 1957. With effect from 2004, the breadth of Norway’s territorial sea was extended from 4 to 12 nautical miles and a contiguous zone extending to 24 nautical miles was established. In 2007, Norway and Russia reached agreement on a 73 kilometre-long delimitation line in the Varangerfjord area.
In 2010, after extensive negotiations over a period of 40 years, Norway and Russia signed the Treaty on Maritime Delimitation and Cooperation in the Barents Sea and the Arctic Ocean. The Treaty entered into force in July 2011. In addition to establishing the delimitation line, the agreement contains provisions that ensure the continuation of the close Norwegian-Russian fisheries cooperation, as well as provisions concerning cooperation on the exploitation of any transboundary hydrocarbon deposits.
2.3 Norway’s land borders in the north
New border agreement with Russia
The Norwegian-Russian land border extends from the Varangerfjord to the Krokfjellet border point, where the Norwegian-Russian, the Norwegian-Finnish and the Finnish-Russian borders meet. The border was reviewed in the period 2009–2018, and a new border agreement that provides a detailed and updated description of the border based on modern technology entered into force on 8 February 2019.
Cross-border reindeer husbandry
When the 1972 Reindeer Grazing Convention between Norway and Sweden expired in 2005, a codicil to the 1751 border treaty with Sweden once again provided the legal basis for regulating cross-border reindeer husbandry. A new reindeer grazing convention was negotiated between Norway and Sweden in 2009, and was signed by the relevant ministers. Since then, ratification of the convention has been under consideration. A new reindeer fence convention between Norway and Finland entered into force on 1 January 2017.
Nordic Sami Convention
Sweden, Finland and Norway reached agreement on a text for a Nordic Sami Convention in 2016. The overall objective of the convention is to strengthen the rights of the Sami people so that they can safeguard and develop their culture, language and way of life, unhindered as far as possible by national borders. The Sami parliaments in the three countries provided input and were involved throughout the process right up until the negotiations were concluded. The Sami Parliamentary Council has since expressed a desire to make certain revisions to the text. The Government’s view is that the convention text is satisfactory as it stands. The Government is therefore not proposing to reopen the negotiations. The Government is ready to work to move this matter forwards towards signing and ratification, and has invited the Sámediggi to give its support to the draft, countersigned convention text, so that this work can begin.
3. Norwegian foreign and security policy in the Arctic
3.1 The strategic importance of the Arctic
The stability of the Arctic has long remained relatively unaffected by conflicts in other areas of the world. However, current global trends are leading to growing international interest in the region and a greater focus on Norway’s strategic location. The changing security policy landscape in recent years and the melting of the ice in the Arctic Ocean are also playing a part. Nor can the possibility be ruled out that increased tensions in other places will affect the situation in the Arctic.
Cooperation in the Arctic functions smoothly in many important areas. However, there have been some chal- lenging developments relating to the defence and security policy situation. This is primarily due to Russia’s military modernisation and increased activity in the north. The general deterioration in Russia’s relationship with Nato and Western countries as a result of Russia’s annexation of Crimea and involvement in eastern Ukraine is also a contributing factor.
Russia has expanded its civilian and military infrastructure in the Arctic. It has developed new military capabilities that strengthen its response capacity and enhanced its ability to strike targets over longer distances and with greater precision. In addition, Russia is demonstrating an ability to make use of a broader range of instruments. In particular, the new generation of strategic submarines, new missile programmes and the revival of the bastion defence concept aimed at protecting Russia’s strategic capabilities as far as the Greenland-Iceland-UK (GIUK) Gap could have major implications for Nato’s ability to keep the sea routes over the North Atlantic open. This is important to allow for Allied reinforcement of Europe in the event of a crisis.
Russia’s military build-up and military modernisation pose a challenge to the security of Norway and other Allied countries. As a result, the US and other Allies are showing a growing interest in increasing their presence in the north in order to monitor developments in the Russian part of the region. Recently, US strategic bomber aircraft have been carrying out regular flights over the Barents Sea, and in 2020, US Navy and UK Royal Navy surface vessels conducted operations in the area for the first time since the 1980s. Allied activity and presence, including in the Arctic, is welcomed by Norway. Norway’s security and defence policy is based on the guarantee of support from Allied countries in the event of war or crisis. This support requires knowledge of the region and of what is needed to operate here. It is therefore essential that Norwegian and Allied forces train and conduct exercises both in and outside Norway. At the same time, it is important to ensure that any military activity is carried out in a way that promotes security and stability in the region. Norway therefore considers it important to do its part to reduce tensions by ensuring predictability and transparency with regard to such activity.
As a result of climate change and the melting of the ice in the Arctic Ocean, the northern coastlines of Rus- sia, Canada and the US are gradually losing some of the natural protection provided until recently by year-round ice. This could lead to changes in threat assessments and thus military-strategic thinking. The melting of the ice also paves the way for an increase in commercial activity in the Arctic. The extent and implications of this activity will have to be assessed on an ongoing basis. A significant increase in commercial activity will not necessarily in itself have a negative impact on the security and military situation in the region.
When it comes to shipping in the Arctic, the picture that is emerging is twofold: the volume of transit traffic between Asia and Europe along the Northeast Passage will remain low for the foreseeable future, whereas destination traffic will rise. Russian and Chinese ambitions to transport more goods through the Northeast Passage have led to renewed international attention to the potential advantages and disadvantages of using this route as opposed to traditional trade routes. Russia has also taken steps to regulate foreign shipping traffic. Any discussion of the development of the Northeast Passage will need to consider the political, legal, economic and environmental aspects.
3.2 Norwegian security policy
Maintaining a balance between deterrence and reassur- ance vis-à-vis the Soviet Union, and subsequently Russia, has been a key component of Norwegian security policy for decades. Norway’s defence and deterrence policy is based on the maintenance of an effective national defence and the guarantee of Allied reinforcements in the event of war or crisis. Our guidelines for foreign military activity on Norwegian territory and other policies of reassurance vis-à-vis Russia serve to enhance predictability and reduce tensions. These well-established principles of our security policy will remain unchanged, but are adjusted as needed to take account of developments in the security situation.
The role played by the Norwegian Armed Forces in exercising sovereignty and authority and providing situational awareness in the north is an important element of the Government’s Arctic policy. We are strengthening our presence in the Arctic by investing in strategic capabilities, most notably F-35 fighter jets, P-8 maritime patrol aircraft and new submarines. These capabilities will enhance our ability to achieve situational awareness and exercise sovereignty in peacetime and will strengthen our defence in times of war.
Allied exercises and training activity in the north are a sign of solidarity between the Allied countries. Norway attaches importance to enhancing the ability of the Norwe- gian Armed Forces to plan and carry out joint operations with Allied forces in the north, while at the same time maintaining and strengthening Norway’s national presence and activity in the region. Important elements of this work include ensuring that Allied countries have access to suitable areas for carrying out training and exercises in the north, promoting cooperation between Allied and Norwegian forces, and providing other support to visiting Allied forces. At the same time, it is important to seek to set clear parameters for Allied military activity in areas close to Norway in order to avoid any escalation in tensions. Continuous assessments are needed to balance these two considerations, and our approach will have to be adapted to the changing security environment.
In the increasingly complex security threat landscape that is emerging, state and non-state actors alike are using a wide array of instruments to carry out targeted, hostile campaigns, which involve both military and civilian actions. Our ability to withstand complex threats depends on good coordination and exchange of information across sectors. In addition to maintaining a good understanding of international factors that affect Norway, it is important to monitor how these factors are manifesting themselves in Norway, including in the north. The Norwegian Police Security Service has primary responsibility for following up threats at the national level, focusing on actors that may pose a threat in Norway. The Norwegian National Security Authority plays a particularly important role in developing measures to safeguard Norway’s national security interests. Norway makes use of a wide range of instruments in its efforts to safeguard national security.
3.3 Nato
Nato is the cornerstone of Norway’s security, and the Alli- ance’s area of responsibility extends right up to the North Pole. Good situational awareness in the Arctic is vital for Nato to fulfil its responsibility for collective defence in this area too, in the event of a crisis or war. The Alliance’s new Concept for Deterrence and Defence of the Euro-Atlantic Area provides a constructive framework for this. Norway has worked for many years to increase Nato’s focus on the North Atlantic and to highlight the importance of the maritime dimension and transatlantic reinforcements for Allied security. This will continue to be a priority in the years ahead.
In addition, Norway has been at the forefront of efforts to strengthen Nato’s command structure and enhance the Alliance’s capacity to plan and lead collective defence operations, including in our neighbouring areas. Particularly important in this context is Nato’s new Atlantic Command, established on the US east coast in Norfolk, Virginia, which among other things will have responsibility for protecting the sea lanes across the North Atlantic. The Joint Force Command Norfolk (JFCNF) is closely integrated with the US Second Fleet and shares the same command and staff structure. This further enhances cooperation and coordination and strengthens the ability of the command structure to fulfil its tasks. The development of Nato Graduated Response Plans for the reinforcement of Iceland, Norway and the northern sea areas is also an important element in safeguarding Norway’s security in the north.
3.4 The US
The US is Norway’s closest ally. In recent years, the US has shown a growing interest in the security policy aspects of developments in the Arctic. This is illustrated by US participation in various types of exercises. It is therefore important that Norway facilitates US participation in relevant activities.
Multilateral cooperation under the Arctic Council with the US and other permanent members will continue to be crucial. It is encouraging that the US clearly gives priority to this arena, as indicated by its active participation in the Council’s working groups. Norway cooperates closely with the US on current maritime issues in the Arctic, for example the process under the International Maritime Organization (IMO) to introduce a ban on the use of heavy fuel oil in the Arctic.
Norway has regular dialogue at senior official level with various parts of the US administration. There are frequent exchanges of visits between our two countries and study trips to Norway by key US Arctic stakeholder groups. Several delegations from the US Congress have visited the Norwegian part of the Arctic in recent years.
A number of universities and research institutions in Norway have long-term, dynamic collaborative projects with US research institutions and administrative agencies. Norway and the US also cooperate at the local level in the Arctic Mayors’ Forum, which brings together mayors from Arctic municipalities. There is close bilateral cooperation between indigenous communities in Norway and the US.
3.5 Russia
Over the past 30 years, Norway has developed broad-based cooperation with Russia in the north in areas such as fisheries, research, the environment, search and rescue, nuclear safety and security, health, education, business, energy and not least culture, people-to-people contacts and indigenous issues. The four bilateral commissions in the areas of economic cooperation, fisheries management, nuclear safety, and environmental protection deal with many issues relating to the Arctic.
However, as a result of Russia’s violations of interna- tional law in Ukraine, Norway has suspended bilateral military cooperation, with the exception of cooperation in areas of particular importance to maritime safety, airspace security and stability in the north. The direct lines of communication between the Norwegian Joint Headquarters and Russia’s Northern Fleet, coopera- tion between Norwegian and Russian coast guards and border guards, search-and-rescue cooperation, and the mechanisms under the Incidents at Sea (INCSEA) Agreement have been maintained. In recent years, Norway and Russia have carried out negotiations on an additional protocol to the INCSEA Agreement. Since 2019 there has been a channel of communication in place between senior defence officials in Oslo and Moscow to help prevent misunderstandings and undesirable incidents in connection with military activity. In the current situation, it is particularly important to further develop contact of this kind in the area of defence.
Fisheries cooperation in the Barents Sea is perhaps the best example of practical, mutually beneficial Norwegian- Russian cooperation and has been critical in ensuring sustainable management of the fish stocks in our northern sea areas. Norwegian-Russian cooperation on nuclear safety and security, which takes place under the Norwegian- Russian Commission for Nuclear Safety, has helped to make our part of the world safer for over 25 years. Norway attaches great importance to cooperation with Russia on environmental protection. The most important framework for this is the Joint Norwegian-Russian Commission on Environmental Protection.
In 2018, as a follow-up to the maritime delimitation treaty between Norway and Russia, an agreement was signed as part of the energy dialogue between the two countries on the collection of seismic data up to and along the delimitation line on the continental shelf in the Barents Sea and the Arctic Ocean. The agreement entered into force on 21 August 2019.
3.6 The Nordic region
Our Nordic neighbours play an active and constructive role in regional cooperation forums such as the Nordic Council of Ministers, the Arctic Council, the Barents Euro- Arctic Council, the Council of Baltic Sea States, and the Northern Dimension. Even though there may be differ- ing approaches and priorities, all the Nordic countries consider it important to pursue a knowledge-based Arctic policy.
Increasing knowledge development and expanding exchange of experience with our closest neighbours in the north will promote development throughout the northernmost regions of Finland, Norway and Sweden (known in Nordic countries as the North Calotte). There are more cross-border services encompassing three or more countries in the Nordic region than in any other area of Europe. The European Commission has presented recommendations for easing border obstacles between the northern regions of Sweden, Finland and Norway. Top priority will be given to improving transport along the east-west axis, strengthening labour market integration and further developing common digital public services.
Nordic defence and security policy cooperation in the north
Due to the geographical proximity to Russia, developments in the Arctic and the Baltic Sea should be viewed in a com- mon strategic context. In 2018, under Norway’s chairmanship of the Nordic Defence Cooperation (Nordefco), a new ambitious vision, Vision 2025, was adopted setting out 16 specific targets for 2025. This was followed up by the subsequent Danish and Finnish chairmanships. Vision 2025 sets out the Nordic countries’ intention to enhance defence cooperation ‘in peace, crisis and conflict’.
Nordic participation in the Nato exercise Trident Juncture in 2018 was substantial. The Norwegian Army’s Brigade Nord took part in the Northern Wind exercise in northern Sweden in 2019, and as part of a cross-border training scheme, Norwegian fighter jets carry out regular training missions with Swedish and Finnish planes over the North Calotte from bases in Bodø, Luleå and Rovaniemi. This joint training activity has been further developed into the major Arctic Challenge Exercise (ACE), which has become one of Europe’s largest air power exercises. Allied countries also take part.
In autumn 2020, Norway, Sweden and Finland signed a statement of intent on enhanced operational cooperation.
The agreement is intended to facilitate cooperation on operations planning between the three countries with a view to coordinating operations in the North Calotte.
3.7 The Barents cooperation
The Barents cooperation occupies a central place in Norway’s Arctic policy in light of the role it plays for Norway’s northernmost counties, the Sámediggi (Sami parliament) and a range of stakeholders in various fields and sectors. What makes the Barents cooperation effective is the combination of intergovernmental and interregional cooperation, under the Barents Euro-Arctic Council and the Barents Regional Council respectively. The value of the Barents cooperation lies to a large extent in its stable focus on relatively uncontroversial issues, which ensures predictability and promotes good relations between stakeholders in a number of fields. The members of the Barents Euro-Arctic Council – Norway, Russia, Sweden, Finland, Denmark, Iceland and the EU – have maintained the constructive atmosphere in the Council in recent years as well.
Norway’s Chairmanship of the Barents Euro-Arctic Council in the period 2019–2021 has provided an opportunity for Norway to revitalise the cooperation and set the agenda for issues relating to the Barents region. Norway has identified health, people-to-people contact, and knowledge as priority areas for its Chairmanship, and has helped to strengthen the cooperation through its work in these areas.
3.8 Arctic Council
Close, constructive cooperation has been established in the Arctic Council between the eight member states (Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden and the US) and the six indigenous peoples’ organisations that are represented on the Council. The Arctic Council’s mandate primarily covers issues relating to climate change, the environment and sustainable economic development. It does not cover security policy. For this reason, the Arctic Council has been largely unaffected by the changing global security landscape.
The work of the Arctic Council has been strengthened considerably over the years. The assessments produced by the Arctic Council’s working groups on climate change and pollutants in the Arctic in particular have gained broad recognition and have been an important contribution to the efforts to develop international environmental conventions. The emphasis on dialogue and openness in the political contact between the members states of the Arctic Council is one of the Council’s key strengths. It is in the interests of the member states to maintain this dialogue, also in cases where opinions differ.
The Council’s work is carried out under its working groups. Indigenous peoples represent an important voice on the Arctic Council, through the participation of the six indigenous peoples’ organisations.
3.9 The EU
Norway and the EU share a number of key interests in the Arctic such as maintaining peace and stability, and promoting sustainable development, research and respect for international law. The EU is an important partner for Norway in fisheries, research and environmental coop- eration in the Arctic. The EEA Agreement provides a vital framework for facilitating exports from North Norway and access to labour in important manufacturing and service industries, and is thus also of crucial importance for job and value creation in North Norway.
Norway maintains a close dialogue with the EU on the Arctic and actively seeks to ensure that the EU’s policy is based as far as possible on knowledge and facts about conditions in the north. We also give priority to dialogue with Finland, Denmark, Sweden, which as Arctic EU member states are in a unique position to provide substantive input to the EU’s Arctic policy.
The Government has decided that Norway will participate in the EU’s programmes for regional territorial cooperation (Interreg) in the period 2021–2027. The Northern Periphery and Arctic Programme encompasses the whole of the Nordic Arctic, and representatives from northwestern Russia and parts of Canada participate as observers. The programme is an important instrument in the EU’s Arctic policy. Horizon Europe, the EU framework programme for research and innovation, is one of the most important funding mechanisms for Arctic research. Erasmus+, the EU programme for education, training, youth and sport, provides a framework for much of the cooperation in the field of education in the Arctic. Norway will be participat- ing in both these programmes in the period 2021–2027.
The Northern Dimension
The Northern Dimension was established in 1999 at the initiative of Finland to forge closer links between the EU and regional cooperation forums in the Arctic. The EU, Iceland, Norway and Russia participate as four equal partners.
Practical cooperation takes place under four partnerships focusing on the following areas: environment; public health and social well-being; transport and logistics; and culture. The Northern Dimension Environmental Partnership has yielded tangible results, and Norway has provided sub- stantial funding for projects on nuclear safety. Since 2014, political dialogue under the Northern Dimension has been limited as a result of the deterioration in relations between the EU and Russia following the Ukraine crisis, but activities under the partnerships have been maintained. The Government will continue to promote dialogue and practical cooperation under the Northern Dimension.
3.10 China
China has increased its focus on the Arctic in recent years and published its first Arctic strategy in 2018. China was granted observer status in the Arctic Council in 2013. Norway supports cooperation with China and other non-Arctic states based on respect for international law and within the framework of existing cooperation structures. Norway also supports Chinese participation in the Arctic Council’s working groups, particularly those dealing with climate and environmental issues. It is important that major emitters such as China play a part in finding solutions to these problems. There is a long tradition of dialogue between Norwegian and Chinese polar research groups. The Government considers it important to ensure that Norway pursues a clear and consistent policy towards China in the Arctic as elsewhere. It is important to ensure a nuanced, fact-based debate on China’s role in the Arctic.
3.11 Indigenous peoples
Four million people currently live in the circumpolar Arctic. Around 10 % are indigenous peoples. Between 40 and 90 indigenous languages are spoken in the Arctic, depending on the method used to classify languages and dialects. The traditional Sami homelands, Sápmi, extend across areas in Norway, Sweden, Finland and Russia. As an indigenous people in all four nations, the Sami people’s activities, their parliaments, organisations and institutions extend across the borders of Norway, Sweden, Finland and Russia.
Indigenous groups participate actively in the Arctic Council, the Barents Euro-Arctic Council and the Barents Regional Council. The Saami Council is one of six indigenous peoples’ organisations that has been granted permanent participant status in the Arctic Council. In the Barents cooperation, Sami representatives play a key role in the Working Group of Indigenous Peoples. The Government maintains a close dialogue with the Sámediggi (Sami parliament) and with Sami organisations and institutions on participation in the Arctic Council, the Barents cooperation and other forums, as well as at bilateral level.
It is important that indigenous and local communities are able to participate meaningfully in international climate change efforts, to demonstrate what they have to contribute and highlight the importance of traditional knowledge and their own efforts to address climate change. The Sámediggi is consulted as part of the Norwegian preparations for the international climate negotiations, and is often represented on the Norwegian delegation. The Sámediggi played an active role in the establishment of the Local Communities and Indigenous Peoples Platform under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).
4. Climate and environment in the Arctic
4.1 Climate change is creating new challenges in the Arctic
The Arctic is warming at more than twice the global aver- age rate, and major impacts are becoming apparent: the extent of the sea ice is shrinking, snow and glaciers are melting, the permafrost is thawing, precipitation patterns are changing and wildfires are becoming more frequent.
All these processes are resulting in rapid change in Arctic ecosystems and the loss of suitable habitat for Arctic species. Some areas in the far north of mainland Norway may warm by more than 6 oC by 2100 relative to the period 1971–2000. The severity of the impacts of climate change on North Norway will depend on society’s adaptive capacity, in other words its capacity to reduce vulnerability through adaptation to climate change. Climate change adaptation and mitigation efforts will need to be carried out in parallel. To avoid losing the Arctic as we know it today, it is vitally important that the world succeeds in achieving the long-term temperature target of the Paris Agreement. The Government will take steps to ensure that Norway’s greenhouse gas emissions are reduced in line with national targets and international commitments. Norway’s target for 2030 under the Paris Agreement is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 50 % and towards 55 % by 2030 compared with the 1990 level. Norway is cooperating with the EU to achieve this target. The Government intends to transform Norway into a low-emission society by 2050, where greenhouse gas emissions have been reduced by 90–95 %.
The Arctic states account for 10 % of global emissions of black carbon, but these emissions are causing 30 % of the warming effect of black carbon in the Arctic. Norway is cooperating with the other Arctic states on reducing black carbon emissions, and has played a leading role in the Arctic Council’s work on short-lived climate forcers. Norway has already implemented a number of measures to reduce its own black carbon emissions, which are now lower than those of the large Arctic states, both in total and measured per capita. The Arctic Council’s collective goal for black carbon emissions does not specify national targets for each country, but Norway is well on the way to reducing its black carbon emissions by more than 25 % by 2025.
4.2 Warmer and more acidic oceans
There is hardly a habitat type on Earth that is changing as rapidly as the Arctic sea ice. The water temperature has been rising particularly fast in the Barents Sea, and the sea ice is retreating. Arctic species from ice algae to polar bears are being displaced northwards. Changes in the ocean environment are being intensified by ocean acidification, which is caused by seawater becoming more acidic when it absorbs carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. The northern seas are particularly vulnerable to ocean acidification because water can absorb more CO2 at lower temperatures. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), these changes pose a threat to Arctic fisheries and may have implications both for economies and societies in the region and for global supplies of fish and seafood.
4.3 Loss of biodiversity
Human activity in combination with climate change is putting growing pressure on the natural environment in North Norway. Unless emissions are cut rapidly, many species and ecosystems may disappear from large parts of the Arctic. Some Arctic species are at risk of extinction. This applies particularly to ice-dependent species such as the polar bear and ringed seal. As yet, few alien species have been found in the Arctic, but the spread of alien species is expected to increase as the climate warms and human activity increases in the region.
4.4 Marine litter and the spread of microplastics
Marine litter and the spread of microplastics is a growing environmental problem in the Globally, the largest sources of marine litter are countries that do not have satisfactory waste management systems, but ocean-based activities appear to be one of the main sources in the Arctic. Investigations have shown that fishing gear that drifts ashore in Svalbard originates from both Norwegian and foreign vessels in the Barents Sea. Plastic waste and microplastics are also transported to the Arctic from other parts of the world with ocean currents.
At regional level, Norway is playing a leading role in the Arctic Council’s work on an action plan to combat marine litter and microplastics in the Arctic. Following an initiative by Norway, active Norwegian-Russian cooperation on marine litter has been established. Norway has provided funding to establish cooperation between research and knowledge institutions, the business sector (including the fishing industry) and the authorities.
4.5 Global agreements on hazardous substances have had a positive effect in the Arctic
Local sources of pollution in the Arctic are small compared with those in other regions, but there are considerable inputs of long-range transboundary pollution from else- where with ocean currents, the atmosphere and rivers. One result has been the accumulation of pollutants such as mercury and PCBs in apex predators in food chains. Despite this, the Arctic is still one of the least polluted areas of the world.
The Arctic Council’s assessments of pollution show that levels of many hazardous substances in the Arctic are declining, but in some cases there is cause for concern. There are still high levels of pollutants such as mercury and PCBs in species such as polar bear, beluga, orca and a number of seabird species. Moreover, new substances are constantly being developed and taken into use. Some of them have properties that allow them to be transported over long distances in the atmosphere and with ocean currents, so that they could potentially harm people and animals in the Arctic.
4.6 Integrated approach to management of the natural environment in North Norway
An integrated approach to management of the natural environment in North Norway is a vital basis for maintaining satisfactory ecological status and trends and for combin- ing sound environmental management with other public interests and user interests. The Government will develop a framework for integrated environmental management plans for Norwegian nature. Area-based protection under the Nature Diversity Act is an important instrument for safeguarding the most valuable habitats and ecosystems. Protected areas must be used in ways that both reinforce their conservation value and provide a basis for value creation. Establishing nature reserves, national parks and other protected areas safeguards the conservation value of these areas at both national and international level. In all, 15 % of the land area of the two northernmost counties, Nordland and Troms og Finnmark, is protected. There are 18 national parks in North Norway. In addition, national parks and large nature reserves cover 65 % of the land area of Svalbard. They have been established to safeguard the large areas of largely undisturbed Arctic environment on the archipelago.
4.7 Integrated ocean management in Norwegian waters
The purpose of Norway’s integrated ocean management plans is to provide a framework for value creation through sustainable use while maintaining the high environmental value of Norway’s marine areas. In spring 2020, the Gov- ernment presented the white paper Norway’s integrated ocean management plans for the Barents Sea–Lofoten area; the Norwegian Sea; and the North Sea and Skagerrak (Meld. St. 20 (2019–2020)). The white paper redefines the way the boundary of the marginal ice zone as a particularly valuable and vulnerable area is delimited, which is also used in the framework for petroleum activities in this area. Another measure is that the areas where no exploration drilling will be permitted in the breeding season for seabirds have been extended to 100 km from the baseline off the coast of Troms og Finnmark county. This change will be recon- sidered when the review of all the particularly valuable and vulnerable areas has been completed. Restrictions on when exploration drilling is permitted in a zone between 65 km and 100 km from the baseline around Bjørnøya were introduced in connection with the 24th licensing round, and have been maintained in the white paper on the ocean management plans. The rest of the framework for petroleum activities in the Barents Sea–Lofoten area and the Norwegian Sea has been retained.
5. Social development in the north
In order to promote sustainable communities in North Norway, it is essential that young people and young adults invest their futures in the region. In connection with the preparation of the white paper, the Government set up a youth panel to provide input and recommendations for developing Norway’s Arctic policy for the future. The panel’s report made it clear that, among other things, young people want to be included more widely in inter- national cooperation in the Arctic and that steps must be taken to integrate the Sami people’s way of life as a natural part of Norwegian identity and culture. The youth panel also highlighted the need to enhance the framework for education and skills development in the outlying districts and to improve conditions for young entrepreneurs in the north, including ensuring better access to capital.
The Government supports a number of international networks and programmes that facilitate cross-border cooperation between young people in the north, for example within the framework of the Barents cooperation and through EU programmes such as Interreg Europe and Erasmus+.
The Government promotes the development of envi- ronmentally friendly towns and cities across the country that provide a good quality of life for people and good conditions for businesses. Viable cities and urban centres have important functions, attract people and businesses and promote regional balance. Compact cities and towns with pleasant physical surroundings, a vibrant centre, a wide range of good housing options and access to a broad selection of goods and services and cultural and leisure activities are important for several reasons. An attractive regional centre can enhance access to labour throughout the region as a whole.
Sami language and culture
The Sami language is part of Norway’s national cultural heritage. The Sami Act stipulates that the Sami and Norwegian languages have equal status in Norway. Sami art and culture encompass voices and experiences that are an important part of Norway’s national narrative. These cultural expressions are of great value to society as a whole and to the ongoing effort to revitalise Sami language and culture. Sami institutions, artists and cultural practitioners play a vital role in disseminating Sami art, culture, cultural heritage and history in Norway, across national borders in Sápmi (the homelands of the Sami people) and at the international level.
Kven language and culture
The Kven language is recognised as a minority language in Norway, and it is also protected under the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, which Norway ratified in 1993. Today, there are few active users of the Kven language, and it is regarded as endangered. However, steps are being taken to revitalise Kven as a language. In January 2018, the Government presented a targeted plan for these efforts for the period 2017–2021.
History and identity
The efforts of researchers and writers in recent years have helped to expand national understanding of the important role that North Norway played during the five years of German occupation during the Second World War. In 1941, Germany attacked the Soviet Union across a broad front. The northern areas of Norway were a priority in Hitler’s strategic planning. At the height of the German occupation, the occupying forces in North Norway numbered around 150.000. For a short period during the German retreat, this number rose to approximately 330.000. The youth panel set up in connection with the preparation of the white paper on Arctic policy highlighted in particular the importance of promoting deeper, more widespread knowledge about the impacts of the war in the north, pointing out how crucial this is to young people’s understanding of their history and identity.
6. Value creation and competence development
In the period 2008–2018, economic growth in the counties in North Norway was higher than growth in the mainland economy as a whole. The Government will work to create a framework that enables companies in North Norway to further realise their potential in the years ahead across a wide range of industries: ocean-based industries, the maritime sector, petroleum, green power-intensive manu- facturing, mineral extraction, agriculture, tourism, space infrastructure and the services sector.
There is potential for substantial value creation, both onshore and offshore, and to increase positive spin-off effects by encouraging cooperation at various stages of the value chain. The EEA Agreement has played a crucial role in terms of facilitating exports from North Norway and thus also in terms of job creation and welfare.
Oil and gas activities and development projects on the continental shelf will open up major opportunities for companies and the industry on the mainland. These activities will also promote the development of a knowledge-based industrial structure in North Norway. The Johan Castberg field in the Barents Sea, which is currently under development, will further strengthen the industry in the region and lead to the creation of new jobs. The planning phase for developing other discoveries in the Barents Sea, including the Wisting discovery, is well under way. Final investment decisions on these development projects will promote further growth in this sector.
North Norway has a long tradition of sound and sustain- able resource management and business activity. Promoting climate-friendly, sustainable production of goods and services will be a key element of business development in all sectors. The Government will continue to facilitate innovation, entrepreneurship and start-ups in the north and will promote a well-functioning capital market.
Ensuring access to labour with the necessary skills and expertise will be a key challenge in securing further growth in the business sector in North Norway. In order to realise growth in the north, it will be important to forge closer links between the business sector, the research community and knowledge institutions.
The share of exports from North Norway is higher than the national average. In the time ahead, the level of activity in export-oriented industries in the north, such as the seafood industry and the processing industry, will largely depend on developments in the global economy and the supply and demand situation in various markets. In autumn 2020, the Government presented an export action plan that sets out measures to support the Norwegian business sector during and after the coronavirus crisis and aims to increase the number of competitive industries that are able to export goods and services in demand in global markets. The coronavirus pandemic has entailed major setbacks and poses extra challenges for the business sector in North Norway as elsewhere in the country. However, this does not affect the future potential for sustainable growth and job creation in the region’s business sector. In the time ahead, it will be vital to learn, adapt and lay the foundation for continued green and sustainable growth.
7. Infrastructure, transport and communications
There are long distances between communities and economic centres in North Norway, and the region has a relatively small population. Despite this, the level of business activity is high, and there is a significant potential for economic growth. However, high transport costs for the business sector and the population and unpredictable weather conditions during the winter may pose obstacles to business development and discourage people from settling in North Norway. Measures that aim to develop and improve the quality of infrastructure must be prioritised, weighted and considered on the basis of a range of factors, not just the socio-economic benefits.
The Government gives priority to involving and maintain- ing a dialogue with the counties in North Norway, which are responsible for the county road network and for public transport, for example in connection with processes such as the preparation of the National Transport Plan. The same applies vis-à-vis the Sámediggi (Sami parliament) in cases where transport infrastructure projects have implications for traditional Sami areas and Sami living conditions. The Government will continue to work to limit any negative impacts on the environment or on Sami interests when planning and implementing infrastructure projects.
Reliable energy supplies are essential for maintaining almost all critical societal functions. North Norway generally has a reliable, secure energy supply and the region has abundant access to renewable energy resources. These resources are spread over vast areas, and a long-distance transmission grid is needed to deliver power to the places where it is used.
Due to the long distances and low population density in the region, access to adequate, secure electronic communications networks (broadband and mobile) is crucial for job creation in urban centres and outlying areas in North Norway. The Government’s efforts to improve digital infrastructure will help to enhance value creation and increase mobility for people and businesses in the north.
8. Civil protection
Long distances, difficult climatic conditions, and extended periods of darkness present unique challenges when it comes to preventing and responding to undesirable incidents in the north. The Government will facilitate coordination and cooperation between different sectors and levels of the government administration and across borders in the north.
Today, most maritime traffic in the Arctic passes through sea areas that fall under Norwegian search and rescue (SAR) jurisdiction. The fishing fleet is operating further north, cruise traffic has increased considerably, and new shipping routes are being considered as the ice melts. In addition, expedition voyages with small and medium-sized passenger ships carrying from 12 to 300 passengers have become more popular. The rise in maritime activity could increase the frequency of accidents. Against this backdrop, the Government has appointed a committee to consider SAR-related challenges arising from the growth in cruise traffic in Norwegian waters.
Helicopter search and rescue capacity in the Arctic will also be strengthened through various temporary and per- manent measures. Coverage for communications services is poor in remote sea areas in the north where weather conditions are severe. Satellite-based coverage decreases north of 72°N (just south of Bjørnøya) and is limited and unstable north of 75°N. Radio communications systems also have limited range in the sea areas in the far north. Reliable, easy-to-use communications systems are crucial when incidents occur.
The governmental preparedness and response system for acute pollution is designed to prevent and limit envi- ronmental damage in the event of oil spills and other pollution incidents. However, there are long distances between potential discharge points and resources such as depots, personnel, repair facilities, airports and sites where recovered oil and waste can be deposited. Varying ice conditions also mean that material and vessels for dealing with oil spills must satisfy special requirements. Greater attention is also being directed to North Norway in the efforts to promote food security. The extensive cross-border cooperation on public health preparedness and response will be maintained.",,Ministry of Foreign Affairs,,The High North,2021-01-26,Government.no

The Arctic Cooperation Programme of the Nordic Council of Ministers is administered by Nordregio. There is one round of applications per programme year, usually towards the end of the year.
The Arctic co-operation programme contributes to the Nordic Council of Ministers’ vision of an “innovative, borderless, visible and outward-looking Nordic Region”. It must also give substance to the Nordic Council of Ministers’ other inter-sectoral strategies, which are based on Nordic positions of strength and areas in which the work of the Nordic Council of Ministers carries weight, both within the Nordic Region and globally, and can generate added value. The work of the Nordic Council of Ministers, including the Arctic Cooperation Programme, has its roots in Nordic rights-based, legal and historical traditions of democracy and inclusion.
It is central to the Nordic Council of Ministers’ Arctic Cooperation Programme 2018–2021 that the specific needs of the Arctic will be accommodated and that the programme will contribute to the region’s sustainable development. In this context, the Agenda 2030 and the 17 global sustainable development goals adopted by the UN General Assembly in 2015 play a significant role.
The purpose of the Nordic Council of Ministers’ Arctic Co-operation Programme 2018–2021 is to create sustainable and constructive development in the Arctic and for its people based on the four P’s: planet, peoples, prosperity and partnerships. Traditionally, the Council of Ministers has prioritised the partnership perspective and worked to integrate it horizontally into the programme. This will continue to be a priority.

but all phases would follow the same stage sequence. Responsibility for leading initiatives was
distributed differently across stages. LEA officials were required to orchestrate the entire
initiation stage, while central government ministers set limits to the scope of reorganisation
initiatives through their power of decision, at the time of the research, over formal proposals
for all schools affected. During the implementation stage, LEA officials held responsibility for
preparation to enact all approved proposals which was complemented by the responsibility of
governors, headteachers and other senior school staff for making detailed arrangements
affecting their own institution. Institutionalisation after the official reorganisation date was
primarily a school level responsibility, with LEA officials’ involvement reduced to assisting
where difficulties arose, and supporting school improvement activity from customwriting.com. The focus of this paper
is confined to the change leadership offered by LEA officials, since associated leadership at
central government and school levels depended on their efforts. If LEA officials did not
succeed at the initiation stage, reorganisation would not happen; if they failed to play their part
effectively during the implementation stage, reorganisation would be chaotic, impacting
negatively on institutionalisation and so on students’ education.",,,,,,Nordregio

It’s one of the world’s few remaining largely unspoiled frontiers, larger than the United States and home to fewer than 10 million people. But what’s the future of the Arctic? The region – with areas claimed by the US, Canada, Russia, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Iceland – is facing the disruptive challenges of climate change and shifting global political, social and economic patterns. How policymakers and business leaders respond will dramatically affect its future.
Arctic 2050, a new report by the SKOLKOVO Institute for Emerging Market Studies and Nord University Business School, supported by EY, finds two critical dimensions of uncertainties could lead to a significant shift in the Arctic region: the quality of the institutional environment, including the effectiveness of environmental, social and demographic policies and regulations, the availability of financial incentives and the quality of governance; and the pace of development of technology and innovation, including the level of digitalization and connectivity, the commercialization of technologies, and the cost of doing business.",,Ey Global,,,2021-02-16,EY

Even when diplomacy failed in other venues, the council, an international organization consisting of the eight countries that ring the Arctic Circle, was able to proceed with its work.
That ended, members of the council say, with the arrival of the Trump administration.
The shift in the Council was gradual at first, but by the second half of President Donald Trump’s term, his impacts were undeniable. The words “climate change”—or even references to the subject—became too controversial for inclusion in joint documents. Projects related to climate change proposed by other nations were shot down by U.S. negotiators who knew there was no way their top leadership would be on board. Negotiations within the council failed to reach a deal.
The changes in the council illustrate the mark left by the administration’s climate denialism on international diplomatic efforts, one that some experts say will take time to undo.
“It’s a bad stain on the history of the Arctic Council,” said Adrianna Muir, who served as the State Department’s deputy senior arctic official from 2014 to 2018 and was a part of negotiations at the council.
In four years, the Trump administration sought to uproot the existing narrative about the Arctic and replace it with something more sinister.
“The line of thought expressed by the Trump administration was that the Arctic is no longer a zone of cooperation, but a zone of conflict and somewhere the U.S. should seek to expand their influence at the expense of diplomacy and cooperation,” said Whit Sheard, the president of the Circumpolar Conservation Union.
Most glaring, Sheard said, was how little the Trump administration understood the region. Whether it was the administration’s misguided efforts to buy Greenland or the U.S. Ambassador to Iceland’s attempt to carry a gun in a nation considered one of the safest in the world, there was a blatant lack of comprehension about Arctic culture, Sheard said.
“It was all an attempt to destabilize the Arctic,” he said, “and it has ultimately left the United States a much less important actor.”
A Changing Tune on Climate
When Trump was elected, the United States was playing a central role in the Arctic Council.
Every two years, a different Arctic nation takes over as chair of the council, an opportunity for that country to set the agenda and showcase its presence in the region. The United States took over the chairmanship in the spring of 2015.
“We went into it knowing that there would be an election in the middle of the chairmanship,” Muir said. “And we had no ability to promise to any of our foreign interlocutors what that would mean.”
As Trump settled into the White House and made his cabinet appointments, the Arctic was not at the top of his to-do list. For some in the world of Arctic policy and research, that was a relief: In interviews at the time, experts working in the region said they planned to keep their heads down in the hope that their work could continue untouched for as long as possible.
At the State Department, though, they didn’t have that luxury.
In early 2017, the U.S. chairmanship of the Council was nearing its end. Each two-year rotation ends with a ministerial meeting in April, which is often a big, splashy event, and it was the United States’ turn to host the gathering. The meeting normally ended in the release of a declaration, signed by all eight Arctic nations, that would signal what work had been accomplished over the past two years and what lay ahead.
The language for that document was already in circulation among the countries before Trump was inaugurated. For nearly two years, negotiators from each of the countries, along with indigenous groups, had been working out what the declaration would say. It would acknowledge the signing of the Paris Climate Treaty, summarize the findings of the Council’s scientific work on climate impacts in the region, and commit the parties to implementing the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals by 2030.
But much was unknown. With a climate-denying president and Rex Tillerson, former Exxon CEO, as his newly-appointed Secretary of State, would an Alaska-based ministerial meeting even take place?
Muir and her colleagues did all they could to get a memo to the top of the pile in Tillerson’s office, she said. “It basically needed to communicate: There’s this forum, and P.S., we’re chairing it and we’d like you to host it,” said Muir, who now is the deputy director of the Alaska branch of the Nature Conservancy.
As the weeks ticked by with no response from Tillerson’s office, other Arctic nations began reaching out to Julie Gourley, the State Department’s Senior Arctic Official, who had been handling negotiations with the council for more than a decade. The other countries needed to know: Was the meeting going to happen? And would Tillerson be there?
“I still recall the day the memo came back approved to our office from Secretary Tillerson with his commitment to host the meeting and chair it,” said Muir. “We did a happy dance. We literally got up and did a dance—a jig. It meant that all of the work we had been putting forward for the last two years could get a bright light shone on it.”
When it came time for the meeting, though, the administration got more involved. At the last minute, when the declaration’s language was thought to be finalized, the State Department sent over several proposed changes, each of which would eliminate or soften the language related to climate change.
Those changes, shared with Inside Climate News in a leaked draft, clearly reflected the views of the new administration. One suggested change took out language encouraging the implementation of the Paris Agreement; another deleted the findings of a scientific report, including a concern that the Arctic Ocean might be free of sea ice in two decades and if that were the case, what impact that would have on both sea level rise and temperatures in mid-latitudes.
Some of the changes were accepted, others were tweaked to keep climate language in the declaration but make it softer. A reference to the scientific report remained, but the description of its findings was cut altogether.
When Tillerson signed the document and it was released to the public, many watchers of the Arctic Council felt relief—despite the new U.S. administration, the document mentioned climate change and the Paris Agreement, among other topics that were now considered controversial.
But to those who had seen the earlier language, it represented a compromise between what could have been and what the U.S. had demanded. It was a sign of things to come.
‘A Constant Push to Make Things Vanilla’
After the U.S. ministerial meeting in April 2017, the chairmanship passed to Finland, and for a little while, the State Department team was able to work without interference.
“We were sort of self-monitoring and trying not to get too climate-friendly,” said Gourley. As the Finnish chairmanship progressed and they began work on the next group declaration, it was up to Gourley to make sure that whatever was written would be something a Trump State Department—now led by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo—would sign. “We were just trying to keep the messaging low key,” Gourley said.
Gourley was in a challenging position. The Nordic countries, in particular, wanted the council to have a strong stance on climate change, she said, as did the representatives from the Indigenous groups. “It was this constant push to make things vanilla,” she said. “It was this three-prong debate about how to make it pass muster with the Trump administration.”
There were times, she said, that members of the group would raise their hands and propose a project related to climate change—a topic that’s never far from mind when talking about the Arctic—but the project would be quashed by the U.S. delegation. “Someone would say, this is something we need to alert the world about that is happening, and I’d have to say no. It was pretty awful,” she said.
And it was about to get worse.
A few months before Finland’s ministerial, the speech writers at the State Department “started to wake up and realize this was an opportunity,” Gourley said. Initially, her staff worked with the speech writers. “We thought maybe it would go kind of well, but then suddenly they cut us out,” she said.
As Gourley’s group headed to Finland for the ministerial in May 2019, Pompeo tapped Manisha Singh, then the acting undersecretary of state for economic and business affairs, to go to the meeting and “straighten things out,” Gourley said.
“She waltzed in and completely destroyed everything,” Gourley said. Despite having no background in climate change or in the region, Singh made significant changes at the last minute to the declaration—removing mentions of ocean acidification, which poses an imminent threat to the Arctic, and other climate-related issues.
At one point, Gourley said, she and her staff were locked out of the room their delegation had been assigned so that Singh could call Washington in private. “We had no idea what was going on,” Gourley said. When Singh came out of the room, she delivered the news to the negotiators: The United States would not be signing the document. For the first time since the council was established in 1996, there would be no Arctic Council declaration.
“It was the worst professional experience of my entire 30 years,” said Gourley. Years of diplomatic wrangling—for nothing.
The State Department did not respond to questions about Singh’s involvement with the Arctic Council. But on Tuesday, after four years of denying the impact of climate change in the Arctic and promoting oil and gas company interests, a department spokesperson—perhaps reflecting the views of the incoming Biden administration—issued a statement that included the following: “The United States envisions the Arctic region as one that is free of conflict, where nations act responsibly, and where economic and energy resources are developed in a sustainable, transparent manner that also respects the environment and the interests and cultures of indigenous peoples. The United States recognizes the climate vulnerabilities and risks that the Arctic faces because of its unique circumstances, including from changes in snow and ice cover.”
After the failed negotiations at the Finland meeting, the situation further deteriorated, Gourley said.
At a side event she and her team were required to attend, Pompeo gave a speech lambasting Arctic allies Russia and Canada, as well as China, which has observer status in the Arctic Council.
Pompeo referred to the region as a land of “opportunity and abundance,” one replete with untapped reserves of oil, gas, uranium, gold, fish and rare earth minerals. No longer did the Arctic Council have the “luxury” of focusing on scientific collaboration, cultural matters and environmental research, he said. As the sea ice gives way to open water in the North, “we’re entering a new age of strategic engagement in the Arctic, complete with new threats to Arctic interests and real estate,” said Pompeo.
Sitting in the audience, with representatives from the countries Pompeo was attacking, Gourley said, “We are all dumbstruck.” Her Russian counterpart came to find her afterwards to see if she knew why Pompeo had lashed out in that way. She learned through other Arctic partners that the Chinese representatives were “very unhappy.” The Canadians, understated but clearly displeased, told her, “Oh, that was an interesting speech.”
Sheard, of the Circumpolar Conservation Union, was at the talk as well. An American who attends council meetings with observer status, Sheard described sitting through Pompeo’s talk and feeling the “most embarrassed I’ve been for our country since I started working in the Arctic Council in the mid-2000s.” He said the “attempt to create a dialogue around a great Arctic competition is an attempt to create a self-fulfilling prophecy.” After the talk, he added, a representative from another country offered to let Sheard wear a pin with that nation’s flag on it, so he wouldn’t have to hang his head.
At the end of the event, Gourley’s colleagues from the other Arctic countries took her out for dinner to celebrate her final Arctic Council ministerial—she was about to retire. They told her that they felt bad about the position she had been put in, and wanted to celebrate her years of working with the group.
After the dinner, she said, “Me and my team went out and had a bender.”
A Need for Mending Fences
Now, as President-elect Joe Biden steps into the White House, there will be some diplomatic fences to mend.
“This push to isolate and bedevil China has pushed them closer to Russia,” Sheard said of the Arctic Council. “That leads to more cooperation in the Arctic that would actually threaten U.S. and economic power interests, in terms of keeping us from being a part of those plans for the Russian and Chinese ambitions.”
Beyond that, he said, the Arctic Council has always been the premiere forum for cooperation and respect for Indigenous values. “I think the fear of some is that Trump’s attempt to undermine this might have lasting impacts for the good work that’s been done over 20 to 30 years with respect to cooperation and working with indigenous groups,” Sheard said.
The new Biden administration will be met with relief, Gourley said, by all the countries except Russia, which supported the Trump administration. And Russia will be assuming a new role, as the chair of the council, starting in 2021.
That chairmanship probably will lean more heavily toward issues of security and oil and gas, said Gourley.
“Under Russia, it will probably be similar to the years under Trump,” said Sheard. “But it is the Arctic Council, and all of the positive cooperation will go on as well. The studies, the research, the cooperation on emerging issues like plastic debris—all of this will continue.”

By as early as 2030, the Arctic Ocean could be largely ice-free in the summer, the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Program of the Arctic Council estimates. And while climate change pushes the ice-shelves a little further north each year, a race to claim it is heating up too.
In 2018, a Russian vessel left Russia’s Yamal Peninsula, carrying the first India-bound shipment of LNG gas from the peninsula through Arctic waters via the Bering Strait.
At the same time, US President Trump abandoned his predecessors’ environment-oriented energy policy and opened almost all American offshore territory to oil and gas drilling – projects in the Arctic region are planned to start this year.
Arctic nations bet on ‘blue economy’ to reconcile climate, development goals
From global warming to over- and illegal fishing, the ocean on which Arctic communities are so heavily dependent is under threat like never before, delegates heard at the Arctic conference in Tromsø, Norway.
Finland, Norway, Denmark and Canada have also proposed significant infrastructure investment within their respective Arctic zones.
For now, environmental concern and growing acceptance of the rights of the region’s indigenous population hold back the rapid development of those parts of the Arctic.
As much as 90 billion barrels of oil and 47 trillion cubic metres of natural gas lies in wait under Arctic water and ice, Chatham House estimates.
But apart from natural resources, the changing geographical value of the Arctic opens up new opportunities:
Cruise lines and cargo companies, with fuel and time saving on their minds, are eyeing the fabled North Eastern Passage, which could potentially cut the distance from East Asia to Western Europe by more than 10,000 kilometres compared to the current shipping routes through the Suez Canal.
But the commercial side is only the tip of the iceberg, experts suggest.
What belongs to whom?
Twelve years ago, a Russian-led polar expedition planted the country’s flag on the Arctic Ocean sea bed directly under the North Pole.
Under international law, Arctic states can claim an “exclusive economic zone” (EEZ) in the waters they border, up to 200 nautical miles (370 kilometres) offshore. The areas beyond the economic zones have an international legal status and are part of the world’s oceans.
Shipping giant announces trial run of Arctic sea route
Danish shipping company Maersk will this week send for the first time one of its ships along the Northern Sea Route, an Arctic shipping lane along Russia’s northern coastline that is set to become more important as climate change makes it more viable.
This means that everything is “up for grabs” as long as a country can prove to the UN that the outer zone belongs to them.
Only Norway and Iceland have made Arctic claims that have been approved by the United Nations so far. Several countries, including Russia, Denmark and Canada have overlapping claims that the United Nations has yet to rule on.
Call it a new cold war
But as Arctic states are starting to map up their territories to compete over resources, the rise of human activity raises the region’s potential as a conflict area. Recently, the US, NATO and Russia have started carrying out large scaled military exercises in Europe’s High North.
The growing military presence in the region has brought back old feelings of mistrust, Norwegian officials told EURACTIV during a conference earlier in January.
“The last years we have experienced new and upgraded Russian capabilities and increased Russian military activity in the High North,” said Tone Skogen, state secretary in the Norwegian defence ministry.
“This underlines the need also for NATO to monitor closely developments in the region, particularly in the maritime domain. The Atlantic High North, up to the North Pole, is part of NATO’s area of responsibility, and covered by Article 5,” he said.
NATO to launch exercises in Europe's north as Russia tensions grow
In late October, NATO will conduct its largest military exercises since the end of the Cold War in Europe’s North, amid growing tensions with Russia over Moscow’s development of new nuclear-ready missiles and uncertainty over the Trump administration’s commitment to transatlantic security.
Skogen pointed towards a recent government report which revealed that Moscow had simulated a mock attack with tactical bombers on Norwegian Arctic radars.
GPS jamming, which has caused concern for civil aviation in Finnmark, police and maritime services, as well as private companies in construction businesses, has taken place at least five times since 2017, coming from “military sources on the Kola Peninsula”, the Barents Observer reported.
The US plans to expand its role in the region, too. Navy warships will sail through Arctic waters in the coming months on what’s known as a freedom of navigation operation (FONOP), Washington announced.
Last year, a Russian anti-submarine aircraft flew to North America via the Arctic for the first time since the end of the Cold War. Tensions arose as the US and the UK were conducting submarine drills at the time.
Between cooperation and militarisation
“We all try to work for a situation where we have as less tension as possible in the High North, especially because there is some cooperation in the Barents Sea framework moving forward,” NATO’s Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg told reporters in mid-February 2019 when asked about the alliance’s increased presence in Arctic waters.
Last October, NATO conducted its largest military exercises since the end of the Cold War in Europe’s North. Pointing to the increasing geopolitical importance of the Arctic region, experts described this as an “overdue shift of attention”.
“In recent years, Russia has boosted its military presence in the Arctic, including by re-opening Soviet-era military bases, deploying new weapons systems and radars and commissioning a new icebreaker fleet. Russia has also set up an Arctic military command. Allies are watching Russia’s Arctic build-up carefully,” a NATO official told EURACTIV.
China, on the other hand, considers itself a “near” Arctic nation without territoriality. In a White Paper detailing its Northern Sea Route plans, Beijing is pushing its way into the Arctic with ambitions to develop a ‘Polar Silk Road’.
Avoid politicising Arctic issues, expert warns
The Arctic has so far been largely conflict-free. If this ever changes, it will probably be the result of a spillover from other parts of the world, Arctic expert Svein Rottem told EURACTIV.com in an interview, in which he spoke about Arctic governance and the EU’s role in the region.
With three EU countries and two European Economic Area members being Arctic states, the EU has a strategic interest in the Arctic remaining a low-tension area, the EU’s 2016 Global Strategy stated, through cooperation on climate action, environmental research and search & rescue.
“The EU has been engaged in the Arctic for a long time, including as a de facto observer to the Arctic Council. The EU is a constructive player in the Arctic and contributes substantially in many areas, for instance in the area of climate science,” Norwegian Foreign Minister Eriksen Søreide told EURACTIV, emphasising the bloc’s soft power in the region.
The prospect of the Arctic becoming a theatre for conflict in the next few years, however, remains limited, experts say.
“If there is any conflict to meet the Arctic, it will probably spill over from other parts of the world. But I don’t think that Arctic issues as such will develop into conflict,” Svein Rottem of the Norwegian Fridtjof Nansen Institute told EURACTIV.

The talks between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his counterpart Sanna Marin virtually lasted about an hour and focused on increasing ""Sustainability Partnership"" which will involve renewable and clean energy, circular economy, as well as sustainable mobility. The two leaders also reaffirmed their commitment to work for multilateralism, a rules-based international order, Sustainable Development Goals and to jointly combat climate change. The two sides talked about Future Mobile Technologies and Digital education and ICT.
India and Finland have much potential for enhanced cooperation on polar issues, taking into consideration India's observer status within the Arctic Council. Both are consultative members of the Antarctic Treaty and both have active stations in Antarctica. Both sides underlined the key role of the Arctic Council as the main forum for circumpolar cooperation on Arctic matters and took note of the increasing international attention towards the Council. India as an active observer in the Arctic Council is welcome to join and concretely contribute to these efforts.
The two Prime Ministers interacted for the first time on Tuesday (March 16, 2021), since the Finnish Prime Minister assumed office in 2019. The longstanding close relations between India and Finland which were based on shared values of democracy, rule of law, equality, and respect for human rights was highlighted during talks.
""We have strong cooperation in such areas as technology, innovation, clean energy, environment, education,"" said Prime Minister Modi. Adding, ""Post-COVID, all the sectors are vital for global economic recovery. And, Finland is a global leader in the field of clean energy, and is also an important partner of India.""
COVID-19 Vaccines
Both leaders emphasized on the urgent need to speed up the development and to scale up the manufacturing of Covid-19 vaccines. And promote equitable access to all countries.
The joint statement issued at the end of talks states that ""India, through COVAX has provided 59 million doses to more than 70 countries. Prime Minister Modi stressed that Finland, also a firm supporter of vaccine solidarity, particularly through COVAX has also invested in R & D of new technologies for COVID-19 vaccines.""
Education
A High Level Dialogue in education between the Education Ministries was announced during the summit level talks. The two welcomed the proposal to renew the MoU between a consortium of ten Finnish Universities and 23 IITs for the subsequent five years.
On Climate Change
PM Modi has urged Finland to join the International Solar Alliance, and Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI) to increase international cooperation.
According to the joint statement they both conveyed their support to an open, inclusive and rules-based multilateral trading system. And also extended support for each other and expressed solidarity in the endeavour to bring about reforms in the United Nations.
Arctic Council
India and Finland underlined the key role of the Arctic Council which is the main forum for circumpolar cooperation on Arctic matters. With the international interest in the Arctic Council, India as an active observer in the Arctic Council can contribute to the efforts.
India-EU Strategic Partnership: India-EU27 Leaders’ Meeting is going to take place in Portugal in May 2021. This will be an opportunity for PM Modi to meet the leaders from the EU. Recently launched EU−India High-Level Dialogue on Trade & Investment is an important tool.

Finland is an active Polar actor. We are one of eight permanent members of the Arctic Council and one of 29 consultative parties making decisions concerning Antarctica.
The Arctic is still one of the purest and most pristine regions in the world. However, today it is also facing rapid and partly controversial changes. Climate change and its impacts and repercussions, both regionally and globally, logistics opportunities that open up as the ice is melting, pandemics and the natural resources of the Arctic have made the region increasingly interesting, but also more vulnerable on the international arena.
As also stated in Prime Minister Sanna Marin’s Government Programme, the key premises of Finland’s Arctic cooperation are the carrying capacity of the natural environment, climate protection, and respect for the sustainable development principles and rights of indigenous populations. According to the Government Programme, Finland will also be an active player in strengthening the Arctic policy of the EU.
The Strategy for the Arctic Region, adopted in 2013 and updated in 2016, specifies the objectives and means of Finland’s Arctic policy. Now the Arctic policy strategy is being revised on the basis of the current Government Programme.
Finland's foreign and EU policy on the Arctic
Finland’s foreign and EU policy on the Arctic builds on cooperation in the EU, the Arctic Council and the Barents Euro-Arctic Council, and in the context of the Northern Dimension Partnerships. Nordic cooperation strengthens Finland’s Arctic role.
Environmental cooperation and respect for the interests of indigenous populations are important elements of Finland’s Arctic foreign and EU policy.
Arctic Advisory Board
The Arctic Advisory Board, appointed by the Prime Minister’s Office for the term 3 February 2020–31 October 2023, brings together the key Finnish stakeholders involved in Arctic affairs. The Arctic Advisory Board is chaired by Mikko Koskinen, State Secretary at the Prime Minister’s Office, the vice-chair is Petteri Vuorimäki, Ambassador for the Arctic and Antarctic at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, and the Secretary General is Nina Brander, Senior Specialist at the Prime Minister’s Office.
The Advisory Board supports and strengthens Finland’s Arctic policy and promotes the achievement of its objectives.
Finland’s Antarctic cooperation
The key forum for Antarctic cooperation is the Consultative Meeting of the Antarctic Treaty, held every year to discuss matters relating to the Treaty. The decision-making power is exercised by the Consultative Parties. Finland acceded to the Treaty in 1984 and gained Consultative Party status in 1989. Now the number of Consultative Parties to the Treaty is 29.
Achieving the Consultative Party status requires significant research efforts, where Finland’s particular focus has been on meteorology, geology and geophysics. The building of Finland’s research station Aboa in Queen Maud Land was completed in 1989. Finland has active research and logistics cooperation with other countries operating in the Antarctic region.

Objective
The ArcHub project aims at establishing a network of excellence for sustainable mineral exploration and extraction in the Arctic. Such a Network would act as an Arctic Gateway and Forum to further strengthen synergy between research, education, governmental organizations and industry in the Arctic region/Europe promoting environmentally and socially sustainable extraction of resources.
The solution (technology)
ArcHub will go across all four EIT RawMaterials activities and touch on several of the six knowledge and innovation themes, starting with exploration and raw material resource assessment, mining in challenging environments and increased resource efficiency in mineral and metallurgical processes, including technical centres and analytical and modelling infrastructure as well as potentially pilot plants. An independent across-border gateway and forum on exploration and exploitation across the Arctic and Europe have not been established before. The main goal is that the ArcHub project will improve and identify synergies and exchange of know-how and experience that in the very end will result in more exploration and exploitation activities in Europe and Arctic. The main impact will also be that the Arctic exploration and exploitation community will have a common, strong and unified forum. The target end-customers are SMEs concerned with mineral exploration, larger mining and exploration companies as well as politicians and governments. From numerous dialogues, meetings, workshops and conferences related to the Arctic, the identified primary needs are:
- Better exploration and extraction methods that may or may not be unique to the Arctic. This requires research, innovation and implementation testing in pilot plants and will benefit from a close collaboration with an Exploration Lighthouse Programme and a High Tech Sustainable Mine Lighthouse Programme.
- Better treatment methods for mine waste and tailings. The sensitive Arctic environment and also fragile societies need unique solutions. Again the ARCHUB would benefit from a close collaboration with a High Tech Sustainable Mine Lighthouse Programme.
- Better understanding of societal issues specific to the Arctic region and a general strengthening of the licence to operate. Issues include exploitation of living resources, indigenous peoples right, permitting and legal issues, and environmental considerations.
- Better knowledge of where the most promising mineral resources are located in order to either direct targeted mineral exploration or manage land use plans and infrastructure investment.
Key beneficiaries are many, but foremost include the people and communities in the Arctic, as they are enabled to build a responsible, sustainable industry and attract investment. The EU benefits as exploration and production of primary raw materials in Europe increases. The industry benefits by getting into dialogue with research and government to join forces towards innovation in mineral exploration (decreasing financial risk), mining and waste management (decreasing direct costs and environmental impact). Exploration and mining have an additional set of challenges when it comes to the Arctic – it is cold, it is too dark or too light, it is remote, there is permafrost, there is a lack of local skilled labour, there is extremely sensitive and vulnerable environment. All of these challenges are challenges for mineral and metallurgical processes as well. Methods developed for exploration, extraction, environmental mitigation and protection in the Arctic require innovative world-class technology, which will be easily transferable to other environments and help ensure best practices wherever we extract our primary resources. The ArcHub project will thus address several of the six knowledge and innovation themes, most importantly, exploration and raw material resource assessment, mining in challenging environments and increased resource efficiency in mineral and metallurgical processes. This project will build up the community of Arctic exploration and mining in the EIT RawMaterials with strong leverage to other activities having the potential to bringing the EIT RawMaterials partners to the forefront of innovation in this field. The focus on the Arctic has the potential of increasing the number of critical raw material resources, SMEs, creation of new jobs, research innovation and investment in pilot plants or infrastructure. The ArcHub project will thus establish a network across the knowledge triangle by establishing a platform for business, research and higher education addressing the diversity of challenges in the Arctic with a great potential for significant innovation. A key success factor on a short-term is a better appreciation of stakeholders in government, academia and industry, resulting in common understanding and jointly targeted research in developing a responsible and sustainable Arctic minerals industry. Another important success criterion is regular submittal of research proposals and sustainable dissemination of results amongst the stakeholders. This is ensured by the regular workshops and controlled by presentation and education and training programs.In the longer term, an increase in exploration expenditures and exploration success rates is the expected outcome, and in the even longer term, an increase in primary raw materials production in the European Arctic, including Greenland will define the success of this project.

A “polar vortex” was responsible for the freezing conditions in the US state of Texas last month, UN weather experts said on Tuesday, before warning of a worrying increase in global carbon dioxide levels.
Spokesperson Clare Nullis from the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) told journalists during a regular briefing in Geneva that the United States shivered through its coldest February since 1989, thanks to the natural phenomenon:
The vortex is “area of low pressure and cold air, surrounding either of the poles”, she said. “It normally keeps cold air in the Arctic, warmer air in the lower latitudes. It weakened this winter so that meant that the cold air came spinning out of the Artic…warm air by contrast went into parts of the Arctic.”
By recent global standards, February 2021 was relatively cool. — World Meteorological Organization (@WMO) March 9, 2021
This doesn't mean #climatechange has stopped.
Average February CO2 concentrations at Mauna Loa, the world's benchmark station, were 416.75 parts per million, up from 413.4 ppm in February 2020.https://t.co/kJLahYTm79 pic.twitter.com/xvuIEBKUTa
Ms. Nullis added that no less than 62 all-time daily cold minimum temperature records were broken in the United States from February 11-16, according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
February temperatures were also well below the 1991-2020 average over much of the Russian Federation and North America, but they were well above average over parts of the Arctic, and from northwest Africa to southern Europe and China.
The UN agency also cautioned that although February was a relatively cold month, this does not negate the long-term warming trend from climate change.
“Cold records are becoming rarer, in contrast to heat temperature records and heatwaves. We expect this trend to continue”, WMO said in a statement.
Globally, February 2021 was close to the 1991-2020 average, but 0.26 degrees Celsius warmer than the 1981-2010 average. This value represents the coldest monthly anomaly for almost six years, according to the European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service.
According to the latest data on carbon dioxide concentrations, greenhouse gas concentrations continue to rise.
Citing the Mauna Loa station in Hawaii - a benchmark reference station – Ms. Nullis noted that average carbon dioxide concentrations in February were 416.75 parts per million, up from 413.4 parts per million in February 2020.
“The fact that we had a relatively cold month does not negate climate change, it does not reverse the long-term trend in rising temperatures due to global warming, climate change”, she said. “The fact that we’ve got COVID-19 which temporarily put a brake on emissions last year does not mean that the need for climate action is diminishing.”",,Unsplash/Thomas Park,,,2021-03-10,UN News

One option is to employ so-called molniya satellites.
The Danish military is tasked with maintaining coastline security throughout the Danish realm. From the mild temperate climate of Denmark’s approximately 7,000 km long coastline to Greenland’s 44,000 km long coastline in the unpredictable and inhospitable Arctic regions.
Thanks to a framework grant from the Danish Agency for Science, Technology and Innovation— DTU Space and Polar DTU are working closely with the Danish military to develop Arctic solutions with both military and civil applications.
One of Greenland’s biggest challenges is creating a better communications infrastructure. The geostationary satellites that provide broadband coverage at lower latitudes simply cannot cover the Arctic due to their orbit.
One possible solution therefore is to send up satellites in an elliptical orbit so they pass more slowly over the Arctic, thus providing better broadband coverage. This type of satellite is known as a molniya satellite, and in contrast to the geostationary satellites, it will enable the expansion of Greenland’s communications infrastructure. An improvement that will significantly boost the Danish military’s monitoring capability and at the same time support small settlements in Greenland.
“In today’s modern world, we are highly dependent on the internet. A better communications infrastructure will also give the small settlements access to high-speed internet. Greater internet access can also help to promote telemedicine and distance learning, once again improving our ability to support small settlements in Greenland. Achieving this, however, will require sufficient bandwidth and a stable internet connection,” explains Michael Linden-Vørnle, astrophysicist and Senior Executive Officer at DTU Space—and the anchorman responsible for collaboration with the military.
Better Arctic monitoring
Another technology which together with molniya satellites can boost military monitoring capability is unmanned craft—something that can also prove useful to scientists. The combination of satellites with high monitoring capability and low-flying unmanned craft that can see in greater detail works well.
Among other things, this will benefit Greenland’s maritime security. The greater the number of sources of information, the safer locals and transitory traffic will be able to navigate in Greenland’s waters. The combination of different types of technology will also prove extremely useful to scientists.
“One thing is that data can be used here and now to generate a situational overview. As the data become historical, they can provide the basis for analytical analyses and statistical material in scientific studies benefiting scientists, authorities and private businesses,” assesses Michael Linden-Vørnle.
Ordinary geostationary satellites orbit above the equator and therefore cannot cover the Arctic. What is known as ‘Molniya’ satellites follow an elliptical path and orbit slowly when they are far from the Earth. As a result, they can remain above the Arctic for a protracted period and provide better communication at latitudes higher than 81 degrees north, where standard geostationary satellites cannot reach.
‘Molniya’ means lightning in Russian. Scientists from the Soviet Union originally came up with the idea of launching satellites on elliptical paths. The concept has been tried previously, but there are no Molniya satellites orbiting the Earth at present.

Satellite at hour 6:
- Molniya satellites for use over the Arctic follow an elliptical path, which takes them to distances of between 600 and 40,000 km from the Earth, while geostationary satellites maintain a constant distance of 36,000 km from the planet. To compensate for the longer distance, Molniya satellites are equipped with more powerful transmitters.
The path—for example with a line to hour 2 or 10:
- Between hours 2 and 10, Molniya satellites provide full coverage of the northern hemisphere.
Satellite at hour 0:
- Permanent coverage therefore requires two Molniya satellites to take over from one another.
Rings on the Earth:
- The satellites send signals towards the Earth as a series of rays (illustrated by the rings) which, together, constitute the satellite’s area of coverage on the Earth.",,,,rumforskning,2021-03-23,https://www.dtu.dk

Against this backdrop, the Agreement on Enhancing International Arctic Scientific Cooperation, signed on 11 May 2017 by foreign ministers of the eight Arctic States, including the U.S. and Russia, as well as Greenland and the Faroe Islands, is a milestone. This “Arctic Science Agreement” is a strong signal reaffirming the global relevance of science as a tool of diplomacy, reflecting a common interest to promote scientific cooperation even when diplomatic channels among nations are unstable ([ 1 ][1]–[ 3 ][2]). It provides a framework for enhancing the efforts of scientists working on cutting-edge issues, but translating the general language of the agreement into enhanced action requires further attention, collaboration, and effort among diplomats and scientists to ensure its successful implementation. With the International Arctic Science Committee (IASC) convening the International Science Initiative in the Russian Arctic (ISIRA) at the Russian Academy of Sciences in Moscow next week, we highlight steps to advance science, its contributions to informed decision-making, and its role in maintaining the Arctic as a zone of peace and cooperation. Negotiated under the auspices of the Arctic Council through a process co-led by Russia and the United States, the agreement recognizes first “the importance of maintaining peace, stability, and constructive cooperation in the Arctic.” This legally binding agreement aims to enhance scientific cooperation by “removing obstacles” ([ 4 ][3]) and by providing a basic road map and commitment to facilitate consistent access for marine, terrestrial, and atmospheric research on a pan-Arctic scale. The agreement aims to improve use of existing infrastructures that were previously unavailable; enable new movement of researchers, students, equipment, and materials; promote sharing of data and metadata in ways that were not previously possible; and encourage holders of traditional and local knowledge to participate in scientific activities across territories (see the map). The science community, working through the organizations representing it in the Arctic Council, including IASC, the University of the Arctic (UArctic), and the International Arctic Social Sciences Association (IASSA), as well as through separate meetings of science ministers, already has identified substantive priorities for the next phase of Arctic research ([ 5 ][4]). Concrete examples of improvements needed to achieve success with the agreement would be to (i) establish procedures to expedite the granting of visas and permits for accessing field sites; (ii) digitize historic and other data from hard-copy formats and create shared platforms for searching data located in a variety of repositories, including coordination with the Arctic Data Committee and Sustaining Arctic Observing Networks; (iii) use organizations mentioned in the agreement to set up and monitor research partnerships across borders; (iv) increase support for field and summer schools and related means for training the next generation of Arctic scientists; (v) promote well-formulated comparative studies designed to examine common issues at multiple locations across the Arctic; (vi) maximize the use of icebreakers and other forms of infrastructure for scientific purposes; and (vii) create innovative venues that integrate natural and social sciences along with indigenous knowledge to address common concerns. Some of these measures will require action on the part of officials in foreign ministries; others can be handled best through organizations representing the science community. Each of the signatories can and should designate an official point of contact with a mandate to assist with the implementation of the agreement, monitor progress regarding efforts to remove obstacles, and make recommendations for the adoption of additional measures as needed. ![Figure][5]</img> Supplies are retrieved by crew from the U.S. Coast Guard Cutter Healy while in the Chukchi Sea, 12 July 2011. The Arctic Science Agreement can improve researchers' access to marine and terrestrial regions. PHOTO: NASA/KATHRYN HANSEN Although the Arctic States are the signatories, the agreement emphasizes that these States “may continue to enhance and facilitate cooperation with non-Parties with regard to Arctic science.” This holistic (international, interdisciplinary, and inclusive) science cooperation broadens the scope of the agreement beyond its defined area (see the map). The Arctic Science Agreement is the third legally binding instrument to emerge from the efforts of the Arctic States, following the search-and-rescue ([ 6 ][6]) and marine oil pollution preparedness and response ([ 7 ][7]) agreements. All have benefited from Russian and U.S. leadership of the negotiations (along with Norway regarding marine oil pollution), but only the Arctic Science Agreement enhances the logistic capacity for cross-cutting knowledge discovery and application. Historically, polar scientists have played important roles in building East-West cooperation as demonstrated at the height of the Cold War. The 1957–1958 International Geophysical Year stimulated cooperation leading to the 1959 Antarctic Treaty, with its membership based on “substantial research” to manage nearly 7% of Earth's area forever for “peaceful purposes only,” becoming the first nuclear arms control agreement. The Antarctic Treaty laid the groundwork for the 1967 treaty promoting the peaceful use of outer space. Derived from common interests of the United States and Russia, among other nations, these two international spaces ([ 8 ][8]) were used peacefully throughout the Cold War and remain insulated from global geopolitics as a result of science diplomacy [see the supplementary materials (SM)]. Drawing lessons from these regions and facing “burning security issues” involving nuclear weapons in the Arctic, Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev observed in his 1987 Murmansk speech ([ 9 ][9]) that “scientific exploration of the Arctic is of immense importance for the whole of mankind.” This speech triggered a stream of cooperative developments with science in the lead. Recognizing the value of Antarctic Treaty linkages with the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research, national academies of science moved quickly to establish IASC in 1990. Science-based public agencies took the lead in the 1991 formation of the Arctic Environmental Protection Strategy, which then became the first signed record of international governance among the eight Arctic States (see SM). This catalyzed the 1996 establishment of the Arctic Council ([ 10 ][10]) as a “high level forum” of the eight Arctic States and six indigenous peoples organizations with observers and six technical and science-based working groups, involving key Arctic stakeholders (see the map and SM). In parallel, the education community created the Circumpolar Universities Association in 1989. With the endorsement of the Arctic Council, the UArctic was born in 1998 (see the map). Within and between nations, research and education together promote understanding of and resilience to external stresses and disturbances ([ 11 ][11]), applying methodologies of the natural and social sciences as well as indigenous knowledge to detect and interpret changes over time and space. For example, diminishing sea ice and increasing ship traffic in the Arctic Ocean highlight biophysical and socioeconomic changes that directly affect the security of Arctic residents facing risks today and across generations ([ 12 ][12]). Moreover, external stressors, which are planetary in scale, raise additional questions (see SM) about the future of the Arctic in our globally interconnected civilization ([ 5 ][4]). Minimizing the risks of policy shifts, the agreement enhances the stability of research platforms across nations to interpret and disseminate previously inaccessible data, as well as generate continuous data to interpret marine, terrestrial, atmospheric, and human-centered changes on a pan-Arctic scale (see the map). Moreover, scientific investigation is being enhanced to facilitate research on land, extending from marine scientific research under the law of the sea, to which all Arctic States “remain committed” ([ 13 ][13]). Resulting questions, information, and observations can be organized into data; analyzed to expose patterns, trends, and other insights; and become evidence that can underlie decisions (see SM) about built infrastructure and governance mechanisms. As an apex goal, informed decisions benefit from consideration of available options (without advocacy), which can be used or ignored by the decision-makers. In the Arctic, this science-diplomacy process (see SM) is being enhanced by the agreement to address the “common Arctic issues,” in particular, “sustainable development and environmental protection,” established by the Arctic Council ([ 10 ][10]), balancing economic prosperity, environmental protection, and societal well-being. In this context, the Arctic Science Agreement emphasizes “the importance of using the best available knowledge for decision-making.” Science, whether for basic or applied objectives, can promote cooperation and prevent conflict by engaging diverse stakeholders in dialogue. With stakeholder inclusion (see the map and SM) enhanced by the Arctic Science Agreement, holistic evidence and options become increasingly feasible for informed decision-making (see SM) to achieve Arctic sustainability across the 21st century, recognizing that children born today will be alive in the 22nd century. As the upcoming ISIRA Workshop demonstrates, the agreement is already generating opportunities to enhance pan-Arctic research that will become increasi…","Log in to view full text

The agency also revealed that the Arctic sea ice is at its second lowest extent since satellite records began in 1979.
September temperatures were well above average in many regions across the globe, including off the coast of northern Siberia, in the middle East, in parts of South America and Australia, with the exception of eastern tropical Pacific. The month was 0.05 C warmer than September 2019, the previous warmest September on record.
Scientists also said that the temperatures for 2020 are showing a similar pattern to the year 2016 that was the warmest calendar year recorded to date. Whether 2020 surpasses that record would depend on other climate patterns such as La Niña - complex weather patterns resulting from variations in ocean temperatures in the Equatorial Pacific.
In the Siberian Arctic, temperatures remained warmer than average in September, continuing a warm spell that has affected different parts of the vast region since early spring. This in turn has affected the Arctic sea ice.
Many densely populated and low-resource countries like India are recording rising temperatures and worsening temperature extremes which disproportionately affect the poorest without the means to cope. And this is set to have an economic impact.

“Given the current adaptation deficit in terms of access to adequate indoor space cooling and large number of outdoor workers and mobility of people in India, large scale health impact and labour productivity decline is envisaged,” said Joyashree Roy, who researches economics of pollution and climate change, among other subjects, and is currently with the Asian Institute of Technology, Thailand.
Arctic ice at second lowest extent
Copernicus found that the Arctic sea ice extent for September was the second lowest recorded after September 2012. The sea ice extent has declined markedly since 1979 when satellite observations began. The agency said the Antarctic sea ice extent was slightly above average.
September is the month when the ice reaches its annual minimum before building up again to reach the maximum, typically around the month of March.
“In 2020, there was an unusually rapid decline in Arctic sea ice extent during June and July, in the same region where above average temperatures were recorded, preconditioning the sea ice minimum to be particularly low this year,” said Carlo Buontempo, director of the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S). “The combination of record temperatures and low Arctic sea ice in 2020 highlight the importance of improved and more comprehensive monitoring in a region warming faster than anywhere else in the world.”
Synergies between sustainable development goals & climate mitigation
Currently countries are focussed on Covid-19 recovery packages but experts believe that job creation, sustainable energy development and protecting human health are all synergistic. “We have shown in the IPCC special report on 1.5 C global warming that there are more synergies than tradeoffs between climate mitigation actions and sustainable development goals,” said Roy who is also the coordinating lead author from India for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) – the UN body set up to assess climate science. “Global cooperation for mitigation is undeniably the highest priority now.”",,Disha Shetty,Science,Arctic|Warm|September|Copernicus|2016|2020|climate mitigation|sustainable development,2020-10-07,Forbes

Arctic protected areas have been established in strategically important and representative areas, helping to maintain crucial ecological features, e.g., caribou migration and calving areas, shorebird and waterfowl staging and nesting sites, seabird colonies, and critical components of marine mammal habitats.
CAFF and the Protection of the Arctic Marine Environment (PAME) working groups have created an indicator report that provides an overview of the status and trends of Arctic protected areas.
Key facts:
The extent of protected areas within the CAFF boundary has almost doubled since 1980. While progress has been made, it has not been even across ecosystems and the report does not analyse how well the suite of protected areas meet the test of being an “ecologically connected, representative, and effectivelymanaged network of protected and specially managed areas that protects and promotes the resilience of the biological diversity, ecological processes and cultural heritage” (PAME 2015) of the Arctic.
Marine Protected Areas according to IUCN categories
Terrestrial Protected Areas according to IUCN categories
Currently, in 2016, 20.2% of the Arctic’s terrestrial area and 4.7% of the Arctic’s marine areas are protected. Protected area coverage of the Arctic’s terrestrial ecosystems exceeds Aichi Biodiversity Target 11 which aims for at least 17% of terrestrial and inland water to be protected by 2020. The protected area coverage of marine areas currently falls short of the Aichi Target goal for 10% of coastal and marine areas to be protected by 2020.
Within the CAFF boundary there are 92 areas recognised under global international conventions. These include 12 World Heritage sites (three of which have a marine component) and 80 Ramsar sites, which together cover 0.9% (289,931 km2) of the CAFF area. Between 1985 and 2015, the total area covered by Ramsar sites almost doubled, while the total area designated as World Heritage sites increased by about 50% in the same time period.
This Arctic Protected Areas Indicator Report, is part of the process that responds to actions identified in both the Framework for a Pan-Arctic Network of Marine Protected Areas (PAME 2015) and Actions for Biodiversity, 2013-2021: implementing the recommendations of the Arctic Biodiversity Assessment (CAFF 2015). It catalogues the extent of protected areas across the Arctic and the trends regarding protected area establishment. It helps track progress towards meeting the objectives of PAME and CAFF and supporting Aichi Biodiversity Targets 1 and 11 adopted in 2010 by Parties to the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). These Targets in turn contribute towards achieving relevant targets within the Sustainable Development Goals (UNEP-WCMC and IUCN 2016).",,Courtney Price,,conservation|arctic|biodiversity|biological diversity|flora|fauna|wildlife|animals|CAFF|Conservation of Arctic Flora and Fauna|Arctic Council|northern|science|monitoring|assessment|reporting|data|policy|CBMP|Circumpolar Biodiversity Monitoring Programme|Circumpolar Biodiversity Monitoring Program|sustainable use|arctic resources|strategy|press|media|ABA|Arctic Biodiversity Assessment|government|intergovernmental organization|IGO|living resources|polar|north,,Protected Areas Index

- The Arctic affects the jet stream, causing extreme weather all over the world.
- The Arctic used to be white but now it's turning blue, and absorbing more heat in a feedback loop.
We've all seen the pictures: a forlorn polar bear stranded on an ice floe - the living symbol of global warming melting the ice caps.
We worry for the polar bears, but most of us are unaware that Arctic melting could be just as dangerous for us.
""What happens in the Arctic does not stay there,"" Gail Whiteman, Director of the Pentland Centre for Sustainability at Lancaster University told Davos 2020.
""What's at stake in the Arctic is actually the future of humanity itself.""
Here are extracts from Professor Whiteman's introduction to the discussion What's at stake: the Arctic:
Earth's circulation system
The Arctic is an incredibly important system in the global climate system. So just like the Amazon is the lungs of the world, the Arctic is like our circulation system and feeds in to global climate change everywhere.
Science also tells us that the Arctic is in crisis. We know based on observational data that we have lost 50% of Arctic ice in about 50 years.
Albedo effect
So just when the World Economic Forum was starting the Arctic was very white and over that time period it is increasingly blue. Now, why would we care? Well, we care because of the 'albedo effect'.
And that is the thing in climate science where if something is white, it bounces off sunlight back out into the atmosphere and it doesn't absorb.
As the Arctic Ocean and the glaciers have melted we see that dark blue is absorbing more and more heat which is feeding through the rest of the system...
Since the 1970s, we have lost 75% of the volume of Arctic summer sea ice.
If you think of that as the insurance policy for the rest of the world to prevent catastrophic runaway climate change we are in trouble...
Permafrost and methane
And then we can see that the permafrost is thawing. Now, permafrost, of course, releases methane which is a concentrated [greenhouse] gas.
And if all the permafrost in the Arctic is released that is like adding in the CO2 emissions of all EU countries...
Extreme weather
If we take a look at extreme weather we can see that the Arctic plays a key point. Now, certainly the Arctic had its own fires. We saw that in Siberia. We see that in various parts.
But on top of that because of the way the Arctic affects the jet stream, it affects crazy weather all throughout the middle latitudes.
So if you remember the Sonoma fires of last year that is related to the Arctic change because of how it affects the jet stream.
If we take a look at Australia the Arctic does not have a direct correlation with those fires.
But indirectly, because we are driving global climate change because of the loss of the albedo effect that will affect things like severe weather and fires everywhere.
It's not just fires. It's also the hurricanes. It's the polar vortex coming down through Europe and North America.
Sea levels
On top of that, though, we can see that with the Greenland ice sheet, we are accelerating sea level rise.
If we get to a 2 degree warmer world we can see from some of the major cities around the world including Tokyo and New York, that they will indeed be flooded.
If we stay at the 1.5 Paris aspirational target we will save the Arctic summer sea ice.
Two degrees is not safe; 1.5 definitely is.
So from a scientific perspective, from my perspective, the Arctic is a barometer of global risk.
What happens in the Arctic does not stay there.
And what's at stake is not a geopolitical question alone or the short term economic benefits from shipping or extraction. What's at stake in the Arctic is actually the future of humanity itself.",,Robin Pomeroy,Arctic,World Economic Forum|WEF|Davos|Klaus Schwab|globalization|globalization4.0|globalization4|globalization four|what does globalization mean?,2020-01-23,World Economic Forum

As the Chairmanship of the Arctic Council in 2017–2019, Finland emphasized the implementation of the Paris Agreement on climate change and the UN sustainable development goals (SDGs) in Arctic cooperation. During its term, Finland strengthened the Arctic cooperation and its continuity also at the highest political level.
The Arctic Chairmanship rotates among the Arctic States (Finland, Iceland, Russia, Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Canada and the USA), each of them assuming the lead position for two years at a time.
During its Chairmanship, Finland contributed to the maintenance of stability and to further strengthen the Arctic cooperation. Finland reinforced its country brand and raised awareness of its Arctic expertise.
The Chairmanship Team at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs
In the preparatory phase, Finland consulted the Arctic States and Arctic Indigenous People’s organisations in cooperation with representatives of the central government. Finland’s chairmanship programme focused on mitigation of and adaptation to climate change and on sustainable development.
The priorities include environmental protection, meteorological cooperation, connectivity, and education.

The Ministry for Foreign Affairs coordinated the activities in collaboration with other ministries and various stakeholders. In issues related to the economy, the Arctic Economic Council was a central partner of cooperation.
Several environmentally sustainable meetings in Finland
Finland organised many meetings at senior official and expert level as well as Arctic conferences and seminars. The last event during Finland’s Chairmanship was the Arctic foreign ministers’ meeting in May 2019 in Rovaniemi.
The Ministry for Foreign Affairs in cooperation with WWF Finland developed guidelines on how to arrange environmentally sustainable meetings. These were followed in all Arctic Council meetings organised by the Foreign Ministry in cooperation with various service providers. The guidelines helped in making environmentally friendly choices, for example, in the provision of catering, in procurements and in connection with evening programmes.

A “polar vortex” was responsible for the freezing conditions in the US state of Texas last month, UN weather experts said on Tuesday, before warning of a worrying increase in global carbon dioxide levels.
Spokesperson Clare Nullis from the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) told journalists during a regular briefing in Geneva that the United States shivered through its coldest February since 1989, thanks to the natural phenomenon:
The vortex is “area of low pressure and cold air, surrounding either of the poles”, she said. “It normally keeps cold air in the Arctic, warmer air in the lower latitudes. It weakened this winter so that meant that the cold air came spinning out of the Artic…warm air by contrast went into parts of the Arctic.”
By recent global standards, February 2021 was relatively cool. — World Meteorological Organization (@WMO) March 9, 2021
This doesn't mean #climatechange has stopped.
Average February CO2 concentrations at Mauna Loa, the world's benchmark station, were 416.75 parts per million, up from 413.4 ppm in February 2020.https://t.co/kJLahYTm79 pic.twitter.com/xvuIEBKUTa
Ms. Nullis added that no less than 62 all-time daily cold minimum temperature records were broken in the United States from February 11-16, according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
February temperatures were also well below the 1991-2020 average over much of the Russian Federation and North America, but they were well above average over parts of the Arctic, and from northwest Africa to southern Europe and China.
The UN agency also cautioned that although February was a relatively cold month, this does not negate the long-term warming trend from climate change.
“Cold records are becoming rarer, in contrast to heat temperature records and heatwaves. We expect this trend to continue”, WMO said in a statement.
Globally, February 2021 was close to the 1991-2020 average, but 0.26 degrees Celsius warmer than the 1981-2010 average. This value represents the coldest monthly anomaly for almost six years, according to the European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service.
According to the latest data on carbon dioxide concentrations, greenhouse gas concentrations continue to rise.
Citing the Mauna Loa station in Hawaii - a benchmark reference station – Ms. Nullis noted that average carbon dioxide concentrations in February were 416.75 parts per million, up from 413.4 parts per million in February 2020.
“The fact that we had a relatively cold month does not negate climate change, it does not reverse the long-term trend in rising temperatures due to global warming, climate change”, she said. “The fact that we’ve got COVID-19 which temporarily put a brake on emissions last year does not mean that the need for climate action is diminishing.”",,Unsplash/Thomas Park,,,2021-03-10,UN News

Poorly built homes with no indoor plumbing. Food insecurity in a community practicing traditional subsistence hunting and fishing. Stubbornly persistent poverty in rural pockets. Environmental concerns as multinationals hunt for oil, gas, and minerals.
This slate of issues sounds like textbook development challenges afflicting low- and middle-income countries. But the ones in question here can be found in the United States, Canada, Russia, and to a lesser extent the Nordics — among the richest countries on the planet.
“Because the northern bits of these highly developed countries are not recognized as developing ... there is a problem when it comes to funding from infrastructure to research.” — Dwayne Menezes, founder and managing director, Polar Research and Policy Initiative
Such is the conundrum of the Arctic, an underdeveloped region that finds itself inside the jurisdiction of high-income nations. For professionals looking to tackle some of the sustainable development needs in the far northern latitudes — a sparsely populated corner of the globe that accounts for 4% of the planet’s landmass — the challenges go far behind the extreme cold and harsh weather.

Last week, national policymakers, local elected officials, indigenous representatives, private sector innovators, climate scientists, and foreign diplomats gathered in Seattle, Washington, for the sixth annual Arctic Encounter Symposium to discuss this complex and little understood region.
Devex spoke with over a dozen experts with deep knowledge of the Arctic, who offered key advice for outsiders looking to dip their toes into the region’s icy waters.
1. Remember, you are on indigenous land
Eight national governments that make up the Arctic Council, a two-decade-old, high-level intergovernmental forum, drew the borders that currently divide the Arctic. But distant capitals lack the local knowledge of how to live sustainably in the harsh region originally settled by indigenous communities.
They include major players such as the Inuit — who run an international NGO stretching from eastern Russia across Alaska and Canada all the way to Greenland — and the Saami, who maintain their own parliaments across northern Scandinavia.
“The task is to bring sustainability back to our communities again, now that we have transitioned to cash or mixed economies, build houses using materials that do not originate in our regions, and use fuel to propel ourselves in the way of the rest of the world,” said Cordelia Qiġñaaq Kellie, an Alaskan Inupiaq and government affairs adviser for Ilisagvik College.
“We cannot go back; we can only go forward, and perhaps that path forward is creating almost a third way of being, that incorporates the best of all technologies, led by indigenous peoples who know the environment, lands, systems, and resources the best,” she said.
Some of that effort is underway with organizations such as the Cold Climate Housing Research Center, which is drawing on traditional indigenous housing typologies to design climate-resilient buildings using 21st-century technology and materials.
In other contexts, that could mean partnering with First Nations self-governments in Canada or Alaska’s native corporations — a uniquely Alaskan system of indigenous-led, private corporations — and their nonprofit partners. Microgrid maintenance software enterprise 60Hertz has done this, to deliver reliable electricity to remote communities.
“I don’t know how we would have been successful flying in and meeting the operators in the power plants where we wanted to work without the chaperoning and endorsement of their native corporation or nonprofit,” 60Hertz founder Piper Wilder said.
She reflected on the cultural sensitivities required of working in predominantly indigenous communities: “There is a lot of value in showing up in sincerity and humility,” she said. “I’ve bent over backwards to look for local hires and invest in native employees.”
Above all, from Western and indigenous counterparts alike, she added, “there’s a very high sensitivity to carpetbaggers in the Arctic.”
“We cannot go back; we can only go forward, and perhaps that path forward is creating almost a third way of being, that incorporates the best of all technologies, led by indigenous peoples.” — Cordelia Qiġñaaq Kellie, Alaskan Inupiaq and government affairs adviser, Ilisagvik College
2. Beware the ‘double minority’ trap
The World Bank is not going to lend money to the U.S. to provide water and sanitation services in Alaska, despite the fact that 12,600 rural homes still lack complete plumbing and/or kitchens, according to the 2018 state housing needs survey. At the same time, national and provincial or state investment is unreliable, arguably a far less ready source of funds than development financing institutions are for the mid-latitude developing world.
A decade ago, Canada unveiled a Northern Strategy, with a social and economic development pillar that has delivered in fits and starts — most recently, a 300 million Canadian dollar ($224 million) commitment to build affordable housing in the north. Russia’s Arctic policy, meanwhile, has established so-called “support zones” to maintain a viable economy in the far north, one-third of the country’s landmass.
How these public policies trickle down to those attempting to deliver better energy systems, improve housing conditions, and tackle indigenous health issues such as growing rates of obesity and diabetes rarely involves big-ticket contracts.
“You might compete for 12 months to land a $40,000 procurement,” Wilder said.
Dwayne Menezes, founder and managing director of the Polar Research and Policy Initiative, echoed this frustration, which he called the “double minority” dilemma.
“Because the northern bits of these highly developed countries are not recognized as developing despite sharing the challenges of the developing world, there is a problem when it comes to funding from infrastructure to research,” he said.
3. Heavy-duty Arctic infrastructure financing could be on the way — and it needs guidance
With the warming Arctic, there has been increasing global attention on the potential for new maritime shipping routes and longer periods of ice-free ocean in which major defense powers including Russia, China, the U.S., and Canada are maneuvering. This so-called “opening of the Arctic” has put up to $1 trillion in infrastructure investments in the Arctic pipeline, according to a 2016 study by private equity firm Guggenheim Partners, which has developed an Arctic Investment Protocol aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals.
Some corners are calling for a dedicated Arctic Infrastructure Bank financed by the Arctic nations, a move that could jumpstart regional development.
The Polar Research and Policy Initiative, meanwhile, is calling for an Arctic Infrastructure Standard to ensure that outside contractors build properly in a region whose melting permafrost and coastal erosion is already causing the need to rebuild and relocate entire communities.
“Even when local mayors and local leaders fight for investment and they get it, the way the money is spent and the infrastructure is built is not always to the right standard,” Menezes said, pointing to the CAD$300 million all-season road opened in 2017 that connects Tuktoyaktuk, Northwest Territories, to the rest of Canada, but may not be built to withstand the expected traffic of a deep-water port that could make Tuktoyaktuk a transfer point on the new Arctic shipping routes.
4. As resource extraction looms, a need to diversify economies
Offshore drilling in the oil-rich Arctic is a tantalizing prospect for petroleum companies, and the region is a potential treasure trove of coal, iron ore, zinc, lead, nickel, and precious metals. As multinational resource companies circle the circumpolar world, the region must diversify its economy with a focus on small- and medium-sized enterprises.
“When multinationals come in, yes you can have agreements in place, but the vast majority of profits get diverted back to existing finance capitals,” Menezes said.
“How do we support entrepreneurs and SMEs that live and operate in the region? That’s the money that’s going to be kept in the local community and possibly reinvested in local development.”
He is looking to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s SME program as a possible avenue to help Arctic small businesses get off the ground — as all eight Arctic nations are OECD members.
Rebecca Lynge, a Greenlandic diplomatic representative to the U.S., is keen to see her semi-autonomous homeland wean itself off its over-reliance on fisheries, which account for 90% of the economy. But without direct air links to anywhere besides Iceland and Denmark, establishing a service economy is challenging for the massive but isolated country.
Still, she does not think the race for Arctic resources will erode principled stances about how to develop sustainably in a territory with strong institutions inherited from the Danish.

Extreme warm air temperatures in the Eurasian Arctic illustrate significant region-wide effects of year-to-year variability and connections across the Arctic environment.
Highlights
- The average annual land surface air temperature north of 60° N for October 2019-September 2020 was the second highest on record since at least 1900. Record warm temperatures in the Eurasian Arctic were associated with extreme conditions in the ocean and on the land.
In the oceans
- Sea ice loss in spring 2020 was particularly early in the East Siberian Sea and Laptev Sea regions, setting new record lows in the Laptev Sea for June. The end of summer sea ice extent in 2020 was the second lowest in the 42-year satellite record, with 2012 being the record minimum year.
- August mean sea surface temperatures in 2020 were ~1-3°C warmer than the 1982-2010 August mean over most of the Arctic Ocean, with exceptionally warm temperatures in the Laptev and Kara seas that coincided with the early loss of sea ice in this region.
- During July and August 2020, regional ocean primary productivity in the Laptev Sea was ~2 times higher for July and ~6 times higher for August compared to their respective monthly averages.
- Bowhead whales have been a staple resource for coastal Indigenous peoples for millennia and are uniquely adapted for the arctic marine ecosystem. The Pacific Arctic population size has increased in the past 30 years likely due to increases in ocean primary production and northward transport of the zooplankton they feed on.
- Shifts in air temperatures, storminess, sea ice and ocean conditions have combined to increase coastal permafrost erosion rates, in regions where a high proportion of Arctic residents live and industrial, commercial, tourist and military activities are expanding.
On the land
- The exceptional warm spring air temperatures across Siberia resulted in record low June snow cover extent across the Eurasian Arctic, as observed in the past 54 years.
- Extreme wildfires in 2020 in the Sakha Republic of northern Russia coincided with unparalleled warm air temperatures and record snow loss in the region.
- Since 2016, tundra greenness trends have diverged strongly by continent, declining sharply in North America but remaining above the long-term average in Eurasia.
- From September 2019 to August 2020, the Greenland Ice Sheet experienced higher ice loss than the 1981-2010 average but substantially lower than the record 2018/19 loss.
- Glaciers and ice sheets outside of Greenland have continued a trend of significant ice loss, dominated largely by ice loss from Alaska and Arctic Canada.
Observing Arctic change
- Advancements in the integration of models and observations have increased the skill and utility of Arctic sea ice predictions on seasonal to decadal to century timescales.
- Important additions to the Arctic Observing Network (AON) systems and data products and advancements in process-level understanding have improved the quality and accessibility of information used to produce the Arctic Report Card.
- The unique Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate (MOSAiC) project concluded a historic, international, yearlong expedition into the Arctic ice pack in September 2020, collecting a legacy dataset that aims to advance the understanding, modeling and predicting of Arctic environmental change.
- Opening of the new NOAA Barrow Observatory, near Utqiaġvik, Alaska, enables the continuation of nearly half a century of atmosphere and terrestrial in situ observations.",,Tracey Nakamura,,,2020-10-01,Arctic Program

An international team of researchers has published the most detailed submarine map of the Arctic Ocean. The study, by Miquel Canals, José Luis Casamor and David Amblàs from the Consolidated Research Group on Marine Geosciences of the University of Barcelona, has been published in Scientific Data.
The map is the 4.0 version of the International Bathymetric Chart of the Arctic Ocean (IBCAO), an initiative that was created in 1997 in Saint Petersburg (Russia) in order to map the depths of the Arctic floor. Published in digital format, the new chart expands up to 19.6% the submarine surface mapped in previous versions.
""The 4.0 IBCAO map is this year's contribution to the Nippon Foundation-GEBCO Seabed 2030, whose objective is to map all seas and oceans in the world by 2030,"" says Martin Jakobsson, professor at the Stockholm University (Sweden), who led the scientific team with experts from fifteen countries, together with Larry Mayer, from the University of New Hampshire (United States).
The new bathymetric chart of the Arctic Ocean
The northernmost ocean of the planet, and also the smallest and shallowest one, plays a decisive role in the regulation of the planet's climate, and it is the most sensitive polar region to the effects of global warming. According to some predictions, the progressive loss of the marine ice layers could open navigation to some areas that were previously inaccessible, such as the Northwest Passage, the legendary marine route pursued by many 19th century expeditions, joining the boreal Pacific and Atlantic oceans.
""The potential difficulty for the current science campaigns in the Arctic is the access to places which are permanently covered by marine ice, and the short-lived duration of the navigation period. However, global warming made these inaccessible areas easier to reach now,"" says Professor Miquel Canals, head of the Consolidated Research Group on Marine Sciences of the UB.
Since 2018, the team has contributed to the 4.0 IBCAO map with data mainly obtained through the multibeam bathymetry in oceanographic campaigns in the Arctic, specially in the western area in the Barents Sea, ""a volunteering collaboration to benefit science and knowledge,"" Miquel Canals says. In its different editions, the IBCAO maps received thousands of downloads over the years and are widely used by governments, companies and researchers with scientific interest and activities in the Arctic.
The new cartography has a volume with a higher and better resolution data than the previous versions, and it includes marine regions which were unknown to date. ""This results from the efforts made by an international collaborative of many institutions and researchers who provided their scientific data to reach a common objective: discovering the depths of the Arctic Ocean,"" says Canals.
Multibeam probes and nuclear submarine under the Arctic ice
In order to carry out the IBCAO 4.0 map, the team used the same technology used in the submarine study in other regions of the ocean. ""The compounds of the new map, mainly the most recent ones, were obtained through the most advanced multibeam bathymetry systems that exist. These data come from oceanographic vessels, ice breakers and nuclear submarines, the only ones to map those areas under the iced sea, impossible to reach with other ships,"" says Canals. ""Regarding the data processing and fusion –with a new Mallat algorithm–, new techniques were added, and provided an excellent result.""
Ocean currents, climate regulation and stability of ocean floors
In general, a better and larger cartography helps to broaden the knowledge of the geological and glacial evolution of such a sensitive region like the Arctic. Therefore, the new bathymetric map identifies a great variety of the shapes of the relief with glacial origins, ""some at large scales—from hundreds to thousands of meters in length—that show the direction of the movement of the ice on the ocean floors, which helps to reconstruct the geological processes of the recent past in arctic latitudes.""
Bathymetrical data are relevant in other fields of polar science, such as the study of the path of ocean currents, and therefore, the distribution of the heat, the sea-ice decline, the effect of inflowing warm waters on tidewater glaciers, and the stability of marine based ice streams and outlet glaciers grounded on the seabed.
One of the most spectacular formations in the Arctic ocean floors is the Lomonosov Ridge, a geological element with more than 1,600 kilometers of length ""which connects Northern Greenland and Siberia and crosses the ocean leaving deep basins in both sides,"" says Canals. ""The most recent cartography studies carried out with ice breakers, revealed the presence of thresholds that influence the exchange of water between both basins, and anchoring marks in ice platforms on the ridge.""
The IBCAO 4.0 bathymetric chart also reveals the detailed map of the Greenland fjords, and provides data of interest for the development of predictive models on the behavior of the ice sheet, currently undergoing a rapid recession, which covers the island and on the sea level rise worldwide.
The challenge of mapping marine floors worldwide
To date, researchers have mapped about one-fifth of the ocean floors worldwide. Knowing the submarine relief of the global ocean is essential to manage and protect the marine and coastal ecosystems, as stated in one of the objectives of the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), approved by the General Assembly in 2015.
Within the frame of the international effort to study the Arctic marine floors, the Consolidated Research Group on Marine Geosciences of the UB is one of the teams that take part in the Nippon Foundation-GEBCO Seabed 2030, the most ambitious global project to complete a great task in marine geosciences: high-resolution submarine bathymetry in all oceans worldwide.",User comments,Science X staff,,Science|Physics News|Science news|Technology News|Physics|Materials|Nanotech|Technology|Science,2020-07-27,Phys.org

Despite its numerous valuable contributions to Arctic governance, throughout its history the Arctic Council (AC) has been subject to criticism and reform proposals from academic, non-governmental and practitioner communities alike. In order to inform this ongoing debate, the paper evaluates the proposals that have been presented for the AC thus far. The proposals are grouped into three clusters: legal reforms, organisational reforms and functional reforms. Each of them is examined in terms of its applicability and usefulness to the case of the AC, and specifically its suitability given the prevailing conditions in the Arctic. What the conducted analysis reveals is that the ideas regarding means to enhance the AC’s effectiveness can be largely attributed to the assumptions their proponents make—oftentimes implicitly—about the nature of state actors and international relations more broadly, without attending to the particular conditions of the case study at hand. This is an important inference, given the unrelenting change happening in both Arctic and global socio-environmental settings that calls into question the usefulness of past modes of thinking and forms of international cooperation. Far from offering solutions, their continuous application in particular circumstances might even impede progress in addressing present and future challenges.

Arctic and Antarctic Sea Ice: How Are They Different?
We often get questions from readers about Earth’s sea ice in the Arctic and the Antarctic, and the differences between those areas. Arctic sea ice has declined over the past five decades, while Antarctic sea ice has increased, and then declined. Why do they behave differently?
How They’re Different
The primary difference between the Arctic and Antarctica is geographical. The Arctic is an ocean, covered by a thin layer of perennial sea ice and surrounded by land. (""Perennial"" refers to the oldest and thickest sea ice.) Antarctica, on the other hand, is a continent, covered by a very thick ice cap and surrounded by a rim of sea ice and the Southern Ocean.
The Arctic Ocean is very deep and closely linked with the climate systems around it, making it more sensitive to climate changes than Antarctica.
During the centuries of human exploration in the Arctic, sea ice covered the Arctic Ocean well year-round, up until recent decades. But satellite observations show that Arctic sea ice has been declining in extent*, thickness and volume since 1979.1 Average Arctic sea ice extent is at its lowest since 1850.
During the summer melt season, the sea ice’s edge retreats toward the North Pole, only to re-grow during the Arctic winter. As a result of ongoing warming driven by human activities, the trend toward summer sea ice loss (from July to September, followed by a winter re-growth) continues.
Recent research suggests that there is a relationship between Arctic sea ice losses and the human burning of fossil fuels in all months.2 Aerosols (tiny particles suspended in the atmosphere) tied to human activities have offset some of the Arctic sea ice extent loss trend; a reduction in aerosol pollution will likely see a sea ice loss acceleration.3 Ice loss at the sea ice’s margins** results in winds driving warmer water beneath the Arctic sea ice, increasing the amount of heat the Arctic Ocean stores 4 and priming conditions for further sea ice loss.
A figure showing current Arctic sea ice extent can be found here.
Antarctic Sea Ice
Antarctic sea ice expands during the winter, only to melt back largely to the continent’s edge in summer.
Antarctic sea ice extent is currently below the long-term average of all decades prior since 1979. Previously, Antarctic sea ice extent had been above that long-term average due to long-term, large-scale wind circulation patterns that drove sea ice away from Antarctica5, making room for more sea ice to form nearer to the continent.6 Climate models, or computer simulations that incorporate all the factors that affect Earth’s climate, predicted this behavior.7 These long-term wind patterns reversed several years ago, resulting in a significant sea ice decline surrounding Antarctica. Values since then have been hovering around the average of all years prior in the satellite record. A figure showing current Antarctic sea ice extent can be found here.
Why Sea Ice Matters
Some of the questions we receive ask why we should care about the polar regions. These regions are very important in regulating global temperature. Because sea ice has a bright surface, 50-70 percent of incoming energy is reflected back into space. As sea ice melts in the summer, it exposes the dark ocean surface. Instead of reflecting 50-70 percent of the sunlight, it absorbs 90 percent of the sunlight. As the ocean warms, global temperatures rise further.
Also, what happens in the polar regions doesn’t stay in those regions. Their changes affect global temperatures and can even change ocean circulation. Earth’s sea ice is very attuned and responsive to even small changes in global surface and ocean temperatures.

It is time to rearrange the world order, an order in which Greenland’s Indigenous and original inhabitants, the Greenlanders, who live in balance with nature and have a great history of balanced utilization of their natural resources, can be given the means to develop their own country, without giving in for big politics and big money…
Greenland is far away from the dealings of the world economy and big industries, but as a nation is largely affected by them – the climate crisis and global warming some of these effects. Another thing is, that the development in the country is largely dominated by foreign companies who are investing in different ventures, while the Indigenous population, the local Greenlanders, are merely spectators to this development.
As a local Greenlander, it is practically impossible to have access to the financial markets, since those markets are situated in financial hubs elsewhere. It is much easier for a foreign company to obtain financing for an opportunity or venture in Greenland since foreign companies are normally situated in a financial mature market that is looking for new opportunities. They have access to those financial transactions, while Greenlanders do not.
With the new blockchain technology and the accompanying cryptocurrencies, we are able to tap into the new financial transaction streams, because blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies are decentralized and are thriving in cyberspace. We are able to tap into those streams everywhere – all you need is a smartphone or a computer to do that. This is the main driver for the Arctic Exchange: to secure that the Arctic region can tap into the new financial transaction streams and to secure that we, as Greenlanders, can be able to engage in different opportunities in Greenland – the New Frontier. To ensure that local Greenlanders have the opportunity to have control over own resources and the sustainable utilization hereof.

Introduction
Achieving the sustainable development goal for the oceans requires a sustainable use of its renewable natural resources [1]. In this respect marine fisheries are not only essential for food security and protein intake [2], but also support the livelihoods of roughly 500 million people dependent on fisheries [3]. The increasing release of carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere causes global warming, while at the same time its dissolution in upper ocean waters leads to ocean acidification [4]. In addition to overfishing, both effects have been identified as potential major stressors to marine fish and subsequently fisheries. Ocean warming affects species distribution [e.g. 5–7] and vital rates, such as growth and mortality [8]. In the case of ocean acidification experimental work shows effects on behavior [9–12] and vital rates [12–14]. Although evidence for commercially exploited fish species is still sparse, it does suggest non-uniform reactions for different species or stocks [14–19].
Given the uncertainties on the single-fish species level it is by no means easy to up-scale physiological responses to ocean warming and acidification to the level of the fish population. This exercise, however, is essential to inform policy-makers about possible consequences for food security and help designing appropriate mitigation and adaption strategies. To this end, one possible methodology is to incorporate the effects of ocean warming and acidification into the stock-recruitment relationship within a bio-economic fishery model. This strand of literature is relatively new and has mostly analyzed either ocean warming [20–22] or ocean acidification [23–26] in isolation. For example, Årthun et al. [22] use a variety of temperature, salinity and climatic indices to predict Northeast Arctic cod recruitment. Only very few studies [27–30] combine ocean warming and acidification effects on recruitment within an integrated bio-economic model.
Lam et al. [27] feed a Dynamic Bioclimate Envelope Model with outputs of physical variables capturing ocean warming and acidification from four different Earth System Models to project future changes in the distribution and maximum catch potential of Arctic fisheries. Fernandes et al. [28] combine an ecological model that captures habitat suitability, species ecophysiology, population dynamics and metabolic theory with economic input-output analysis to study how ocean warming and acidification affect commercially important fisheries in the UK. Unlike Lam et al. and Fernandes et al., our model explicitly includes dynamic feedbacks between the ecological and the economic part of the model.
Closest to our modelling framework are Cooley et al. [29] and Voss et al. [30]. Cooley et al. [29] focus on the United States Atlantic sea scallop fishery by modelling ocean acidification effects on juvenile sea scallop as well as ocean warming and acidification effects on adults. OA effects on scallop recruitment are included into a Berverton-Holt stock recruitment relationship while deep-water temperature and ocean acidification effects on scallop growth are used to adjust the body growth coefficient of adult scallops, which is assumed directly proportional to the growth in calcification. Voss et al. [30] employ a methodology very similar to our study. They alter the parameters of growth and natural mortality of a Ricker type stock-recruitment function in a dynamic age-structured fishery model and find that the management of the Western Baltic Cod fishery will not be able to adapt to the combined effect of ocean warming and acidification.
Our contribution to this strand of literature is twofold: First, we provide a very relevant case study. The Northeast Arctic cod (Gadus morhua) is the world’s largest cod stock supporting one of the commercially most valuable fisheries with a long history [31–33]. The effect of rising temperatures on Northeast Arctic cod recruitment has so far been positive [21–22], and likely has supported stock management and assisted in stock recovery over recent years. However, comparisons between cod stocks suggest a non-linear relationship between temperature and recruitment. At bottom temperatures below 5°C recruitment increases with sea surface temperature, while recruitment decreases above bottom temperatures of 8.5°C [34–35]. Whereas overall the effects of ocean acidification are still less understood, there is evidence that ocean acidification may have a significant effect on recruitment of Northeast Arctic cod [14, 36]. It is therefore becoming increasingly important to not study the effects of ocean warming in isolation, but in interaction with ocean acidification as an additional stressor that impedes recruitment success. Moreover, due to polar amplification the Arctic Ocean and the marginal Barents Sea are warming faster than the global average [37, 38, 4] and are expected to experience the strongest acidification of the global ocean [39].
Second, our methodology brings together time-series econometrics, experimental data and bio-economic modelling. Thereby it offers a promising methodology to analyze the sustainability of renewable natural resources and its repercussions on key socio-economic indicators. Our results confirm the initial positive effect of ocean warming on the Northeast Arctic cod stock, but also indicate an optimal temperature beyond which additional warming negatively influences recruitment and fishing outcomes. When considering the additional effect of ocean acidification that is projected under a business-as-usual scenario, the fishery could be at risk of collapse by the end of the century, even if fishery management would optimally adapt fishing pressure and gear selectivity. Because Northeast Arctic cod supports one of the most important fisheries in the world, the stock’s contribution to sustainable food production could be at stake in a few decades’ time.
Materials and methods
We quantify both the isolated and combined effects of ocean warming and acidification on Northeast Arctic cod recruitment using time-series data of ocean temperature from the Kola Section–one of the longest oceanic time-series and a well-known indicator of Barents sea temperature [40]–as well as published experimental data from Stiasny et al. [14] that show acidification to have a strongly negative effect on recruitment. We scale up physiological responses to ocean warming and acidification to population-level processes by considering how both stressors could modify the parameters of growth, mortality and reproduction within a Ricker type stock-recruitment relationship [41] in an age-structured fishery model. Following Hjermann et al. [42] and Röckmann et al. [43], our main assumption is that ocean warming and acidification both cause changes in early life stage mortality rates leading to a density-independent mortality rate during the recruitment phase.
Mortality during the recruitment process is due to density-independent and density-dependent effects, both of which may potentially be affected by warming and acidification. Although Myers and Cadigan [44] and Fromentin et al. [45] showed that density-dependent mortality can be important for cod populations in general, there is no evidence linking density-dependent mortality to changing environmental conditions.
Population level effects of ocean warming
To include the effects of ocean warming in the stock-recruitment model for Northeast Arctic cod, we use annual time-series data on spawning stock biomass and recruitment numbers from 1946 to 2013 supplied by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea [46]. The monthly temperature data were taken from the Kola Section [40]. Temperature data are the monthly-integrated mean for 0–200 m depth along the 33°30′E meridian from 69°30 to 77°00′N for each year between 1921 and 2013. Although these data are not depth-specific, the monthly-integrated mean is a widely used indicator for the impacts of ocean warming on cod populations in the Barents Sea [47–50]. Using Ordinary Least Squares regression, we find that the January temperature statistically best explains recruitment within this period.
Using Rt+3 for the number of recruits in year t at age 3 years, SSBt for spawning stock biomass in year t, Tt for the Kola Section in January of year t, and εt to denote an independent and identically distributed error term, we estimate the following stock-recruitment function: (1)
The final estimators are given in Table 1.
We find a non-linear effect of the January seawater temperature on recruitment. Initially a one-percent increase in January seawater temperature leads a 4.03% increase of the 3-year old recruits per spawning stock biomass, while this effect decreases by 0.45% for every additional percentage increase in temperature. Hence, we find that stock recruitment for Northeast Arctic cod is an increasing but concave function of the January seawater temperature. The latter implies an optimal temperature beyond which additional warming has a negative effect on recruitment.
Population level effects of ocean acidification
Estimates of mortality increase due to ocean acidification are based on experiments by Stiasny et al. [14] in which the survival of cod larvae was quantified in direct response to increased partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) levels. Eggs and larvae from the Northeast Arctic cod stock caught in the Barents Sea were kept under control conditions (~400–500 μatm corresponding to pH 7.6±0.03) and elevated CO2 conditions (~1100 μatm corresponding to pH 7.9±0.15) until 25 days post-hatching, and survival was monitored closely. The elevated pCO2, which is globally predicted to be likely reached by the end of the century under the IPCC RPC8.5 scenario, but due to the increased solubility in colder waters and retreated sea ice in the Arctic is likely reached much sooner in the Arctic, resulted in a doubling of daily mortality rates compared to present-day CO2 concentrations during the first 25 days post hatching, a critical phase for population recruitment. The results were consistent under different feeding regimes. In this study we use the estimate of Stiasny et al. [14] in their more conservative scenario, implying that recruitment under end-of-century acidification may be reduced to 24.5% of the recruitment under baseline CO2 levels. While the time-series approach for integrating ocean warming effects allows us to model a continuum of ocean warming, the experimental results only support an analysis of the additional effect of projected end-of century ocean acidification compared to a scenario without acidification.
Age-structured ecological-economic optimization model
Following the approach of Tahvonen et al. [51,52], we apply an ecological-economic optimization model for a fishery of an age-structured fish stock, parameterized for the Northeast Arctic cod fishery. The model calculates the economically optimal fishing effort and related total allowable catch (TAC) to be set under steady state conditions. This analysis considers maximum economic yield management, i.e. catch, gear choice and age-specific stock numbers are determined to maximize steady-state economic surplus. We use xst to denote the number of fish in age class s = 1,…,n at the beginning of year t. The number of fish that are caught from age class s in year t is denoted by hst. We include n = 13 age classes with the last age class subsuming all individual fish that are 13 years or older. Spawning stock biomass follows as (2) for which weights-at-age ws are taken from ICES [46: table 3.8] and maturity-at-age gs from ICES [46: table 3.11]. The relationship between spawning stock biomass and recruitment three years later is captured by calculating recruitment as one-year old fish that then face zero natural mortality until becoming three-year old fish. Because of this implementation strategy, the Ricker-type stock-recruitment function includes the new variable x for recruitment, while the estimates for φ0, φ1, φT and remain as reported in Table 1. (3)
The dynamics of age classes s = 2,…,n follow as (4) (5)
In Eqs (4) and (5) denotes total biomass caught (across all age classes), and is the efficient stock size ICES [48], that is the total fishable biomass when sorting grid spacing σt may limit the age-specific catchabilities qs(σt) to values below one. The sorting grid became mandatory in the Northeast Arctic in 1997. All fishing trawlers must use a grid with a minimum bar spacing of 55 mm [53]. The equality (6) used above follows from the assumption that the share of age class s in a catch equals its share in efficient biomass, (7)
The general functional relationship between sorting grid spacing σt (in mm) and the age-specific catchability coefficients qs(θt) are as found in [54]: (8)
For Eq (8) Sistiaga [53] have estimated the following relationships for Northeast Arctic cod, while we use the means of the values reported by ICES [48: tables A5, A7 and A1] for the length-at-age values ls. (9)(10)
Following the approach of Diekert et al. [55–56] and Diekert [57], this study considers age- and year-specific average landing prices ps, calculated from the landing tickets of Norwegian trawlers. For each weight category and year, the cumulated catch value in NOK was divided by the respective cumulated live weight caught. Our model of fishing costs assumes that fishers choose the different input variables (capital, labor, fuel) such as to maximize profits. Adopting the standard formulation from biomass models, fishing profits and hence profit margins can be written as (11) (12) which we rearrange to yielding the following equation: (13)
Using time-series data on fish prices, landings, biomass, stock numbers at age, and profit margins, we can use (13) in logarithmic form to estimate the parameters c0 and γ of the cost function. For this, annual means of the profit margins of Norwegian trawlers, defined as , were calculated from data of the Norwegian Directorate of Fisheries [58]. The estimates (standard errors in parentheses) of ln(c0) = 2.8463 (1.1514) and 1−γ = 0.8959 (0.1796) were computed using an Ordinary Least Squares regression with seven data points between 2004 and 2010 (R2 = 0.8327). Transforming these estimates yielded c0 = 17.224 and γ = 0.104.
In our optimization model, we determine catches and grid size of the fishing gear such as to maximize the annual profit (Eq 11) subject to the age-structured population dynamics (Eqs 2–6) and gear selectivity (Eqs 7 and 8). As the population dynamics of cod are on a much faster time scale than ocean warming and acidification, we report all optimized variables for a fish population that is in steady state under the given climate conditions.
Combined effect of ocean warming and acidification
As the first step of the analysis, we construct a risk of stock collapse indicator by considering the combined effects of fishing, warming and acidification. For this sake, we vary both fishing mortality and January temperature to study the combined effects of fishing and warming on the expected stock size in steady state. We repeat the analysis for the case with and without acidification-induced mortality of early life history stages of cod. Thus, our analysis includes a temporal evolution of January temperature from the Kola section, but can only capture the same level of ocean acidification for every incremental increase in ocean temperature. In all computations, we keep the sorting grid size at 55mm, according to current regulation [53]. Specifically, the risk of stock collapse indicator is constructed by using the age-structured fishery model to compute the resulting steady-state stock size under the combined stressors of ocean warming and acidification and divide it by the unfished steady-state biomass for the optimal temperature. Thereby we obtain an indicator of how the combined stressors of fishing, warming and acidification reduces the equilibrium stock size. The risk of stock collapse is then calculated as one minus this indicator.
As a second step, we used the age-structured ecological-economic optimization model to calculate the economically optimal fishing management in terms of fishing mortality and gear choice for different levels of temperature increase, and with or without acidification effects. We thereby investigate how to best adapt the management of the Northeast Arctic cod fishery to changing environmental conditions. Adaptation to the environmental stressors of ocean warming and acidification could be implemented by reducing fishing pressure on the stock, for example by decreasing total allowable catches, or by adapting the selectivity of fishing gear, to preserve more older spawners which have a higher fertility. We analyze the effect of increasing seawater temperature and fishing pressure on the target stock size. Subsequently, we take the additional mortality due to projected end of century ocean acidification into consideration. Specifically, we calculate the economically optimal fishery management in terms of fishing mortality and gear choice for different levels of temperature increase, and with and without the additional ocean acidification effect on mortality.
Results
Risk of stock collapse under fishing, warming and acidification
Fig 1 shows the risk of stock collapse as a function of (i) seawater temperature increase in January, which is the month with the highest explanatory power on recruitment, and (ii) fishing mortality. Darker shades of red indicate a higher risk of collapse. For example, a value of 0.9 translates into a stock decline to 10% of the un-fished biomass at optimal January seawater temperature conditions. While the left panel considers only fishing pressure and ocean warming, the right panel takes the additional effect of larvae mortality due to ocean acidification into consideration, indicating a strongly increased risk of collapse.
‘Burning ember’ plots showing the combined effect of fishing and warming on the Northeast Arctic cod stock without taking into account mortality due to acidification (left panel) and the combined effect of fishing and warming plus the extra mortality due to acidification (right panel). In both plots, the January seawater temperature ranges from 2.7°C (the minimum in the time series) to 6.7°C (beyond the historical maximum) and fishing mortality ranges from zero to one. Color codes show the risk-of-collapse-indicator, with darker shades of red/purple indicating a higher risk of stock collapse.
In both panels of Fig 2 an ‘optimal’ temperature of 4.5°C is roughly visible. At this temperature, the stock can support a much higher fishing mortality for the same risk of stock collapse. Without acidification effects (left panel), even at a fishing mortality of F = 0.5 corresponding to a yearly fraction of 39% of the stock fished, the steady-state population size is about half that of the unfished size. Overall, ocean acidification greatly increases the risk of stock collapse. Under the combined effect of warming and acidification, the levels of fishing mortality that the stock can support to minimize the risk of stock collapse are much lower than under warming only. In this case the fishery management would have to adapt by drastically lowering fishing pressure on the stock.
Depicted are catch and recruits (top panel), fishing mortality and mean age of catch under optimal management (middle panel), and net revenue and spawning stock biomass (lower panel). Plots in the left column show results for warming only, while plots in the right column show results for the combined effect of warming and acidification. It is important to note the marked change in scale for the two sets of vertical axes.
Socio-ecological effects of ocean warming
The ecological-economic model determines optimized fishing mortality, size of the spawning stock, catch level, and profits for the fishery (Fig 2A–2C). The temperature range considered spans 2.7°C to 6.7°C January temperature. The number of recruits is at a maximum of 1100 million for a temperature optimum around 4.5°C. At about 0.9 million tons, the corresponding catch is close to the levels reached in the early 1970s. This optimal temperature maximizes net revenues at around NOK 2300 (US$ 266) million per year, while the spawning stock biomass is kept at an optimal level of around 1.5 million tons that is only slightly above the current estimated stock level at 1.486 million tons [59]. At the optimal temperature of 4.5°C fishing effort reaches a maximum of 0.25 per year. The sorting grid size is chosen such that the mean age of catch of 6.5 years is close to the current level.
Socio-ecological effects of ocean warming and acidification
The combined effect of ocean warming and acidification on the stock-recruitment of Northeast Arctic cod results in severe outcomes for the fishery (see Fig 2D–2F). Recruitment and catch are reduced to about a quarter of the numbers reached when acidification is excluded. Under the optimal January seawater temperature for the fishery (4.5°C), the optimal spawning stock biomass is higher and decreases faster under the combined case than under ocean warming only in order to buffer the adverse effects of ocean acidification. Hence, under ocean acidification the fishery is much more vulnerable to temperatures that deviate from the optimum. Net revenues decrease to about 10% of those attained without acidification, while the optimal fishing mortality is reduced by about 80%. In summary all social-ecological indicators point in the same direction: Commercial fishing activities will need to be reduced drastically to sustain the profitability of the Northeast Arctic cod fishery under ocean warming and acidification. As a consequence, it is likely that not only the fishery’s contribution to food security will be at stake, but also less fishermen will be employed in the industry.
Conclusions and discussion
This paper uses a combination of time-series econometrics, in-situ experiments and an bio-economic optimization model to study the ecological and economic effects of ocean warming and acidification on one of the commercially important fish stocks in the North Atlantic; a natural environment that can be deemed an ‘early warning system’ for climate change in marine environments. The analysis examined how increasing temperature and CO2 affect ecological (stock size), economic (profits), consumer-related (harvest) and social (fishing effort) indicators, ranging from present-day conditions to future climate change scenarios. Results show that climate change will benefit the fishery as long as the temperature is still below the optimum for cod reproduction. However, under a combined scenario of ocean warming and acidification that is likely to occur by the end of the century in the Barents Sea, this commercially important fishery may be at risk of collapse, even with the best adaptation efforts in terms of reduced fishing intensity. Our results thus highlight the immediate need for adaptive fisheries management in the light of anticipated ocean warming and acidification in order to sustain the fishery’s profitability, contribution to food security and employment possibilities.
This study faces limitations in current knowledge that can provide new challenges for future research. The first limitation relates to the physiological response of fish populations to ocean acidification, which is highly uncertain. On the one-hand potential negative impacts have been found for the organ structure of larvae fish [15, 17], hatching success [60], sensory abilities and behavior [61–62] or with respect to the survival in very early larval stages [13, 63]. Early life stages prior to gill formation have a limited capacity for pH regulation [64] and are therefore more vulnerable to environmental change. On the other hand, for different fish populations other studies have reported no impact on egg or larval survival under acidification levels addressed in this study [15, 19, 63]. Moreover, research that suggests effects on behavior could not be replicated in recent studies [65]. In addition, due to the high capacity of adult fish to osmoregulate, they have been found to be tolerant to extreme values of ocean acidification [66]. Thus, we neglect the potential for acclimation and adaption to ocean acidification resulting in potentially over-pessimistic scenarios.
The second limitation relates to how ocean warming and acidification are incorporated into the integrated bio-economic modelling framework. With respect to ocean acidification this study builds on the experiments reported by Stiasny et al. [14] that only rely on two CO2 scenarios. The elevated CO2 treatment corresponds to a business-as-usual emissions scenario consistent with RCP8.5 globally, but is also contained in the confidence intervals for more optimistic scenarios like RCP4.5 and RCP2.6 [4]. Additionally, considering the faster climate change in the Arctic region due to the feedback related to retreating sea ice and the high solubility of CO2 in colder waters, ocean acidification in high latitude regions will far exceed the global average making our scenario likely much earlier [67]. Because until now experimental work cannot provide data for a case between the two extreme scenarios, it will be important to explore other ways of quantifying the implications of ocean acidification on recruitment.
Ocean warming, in turn, is a widely accepted driver of vital rates of fish such as growth, or mortality [68–69], while the cod stock’s reaction to temperature increase can be both positive and negative [37]. Thereby, the effect of temperature increase on recruitment has both a direct physiological impact on juveniles and an indirect effect through other climate variables as well as changes in prey fields and food availability [70]. Sundby [70], for example, suggests that the recruitment-temperature relationship for Atlantic cod is a proxy for food availability of the copepod Calanus finmarchicus during early life stages. In this paper, we did not describe mechanistic processes how temperature affects recruitment. Rather we have adopted a reduced-form approach and estimated the compound effect of temperature changes on cod recruitment by means of a statistical analysis of time series data. Accordingly, projections have to be considered with caution, especially if they go beyond the past range of variation in climate variables and recruitment.
Moreover, this study relies on the monthly-integrated mean temperature for 0–200 m depth along the Kola Section, as well as general scenarios for atmospheric CO2 concentrations and hence lacks the spatial resolution relevant for cod spawning areas. The Kola section temperature in the eastern Barents Sea does not fully reflect the ambient temperature that the recruiting larvae and pelagic juveniles experience along the drift pattern during the first half year of life. Moreover, this study abstracts from spatial redistribution of the cod stock due to changing environmental conditions [37]. One promising research approach that overcomes the limitation on how ocean warming and acidification are incorporated into the modeling framework could be to use an ecosystem model that explicitly captures both in situ warming and acidification for different depth layers in the Barents Sea. Such a model could also take into account the availability of food as an important driver of recruitment and hence cover direct, indirect and combined effects.
Finally, our study has focused on the long-term average effects of ocean warming and acidification. In reality, fish populations commonly exhibit substantial variability in recruitment, even under present-day climate conditions [e.g. 71–72]. Whereas previous studies suggest that the optimal management strategy is not sensitive to the stochastic nature of recruitment [52], a stochastic model that fully takes into account the variability in recruitment by considering a stochastic optimization would be needed to more precisely assess the effects of ocean warming and acidification on the likelihood of stock collapse, especially on shorter time scales.
In summary, the modelling approach described here cannot capture all real world complexities associated with the socio-ecological effects of ocean warming and acidification on an important commercial fishery, such as that for Northeast Arctic cod. On this basis, rather than considering the results obtained here as firm predictions, they should be seen as an illustration of what could happen if unregulated ocean acidification was added to the well-known stressors of warming and fishing.

Foreword from the minister
The Arctic and Northern Policy Framework is a profound change of direction for the Government of Canada. For too long, Canada's Arctic and northern residents, especially Indigenous people, have not had access to the same services, opportunities, and standards of living as those enjoyed by other Canadians. There are longstanding inequalities in transportation, energy, communications, employment, community infrastructure, health and education. While almost all past governments have put forward northern strategies, none closed these gaps for the people of the North, or created a lasting legacy of sustainable economic development.
In her 2016 Interim Report on the Shared Arctic Leadership Model, Minister's Special Representative Mary Simon said, ""the simple fact is that Arctic strategies throughout my lifetime have rarely matched or addressed the magnitude of the basic gaps between what exists in the Arctic and what other Canadians take for granted.""
Co-developing the new framework became a bold opportunity to shape and direct change in the region by collaborating with governments, northerners and Indigenous governments and organizations. Consultation was not enough to meet the challenges and harness emerging opportunities in the Arctic and North. In a significant shift, the federal government, Indigenous peoples, Inuit, First Nations and Métis, 6 territorial and provincial governments (Yukon, Northwest Territories, Nunavut, Newfoundland and Labrador, Quebec, and Manitoba) contributed to this framework together.
A shared vision
Today, there is a shared vision of the future where northern and Arctic people are thriving, strong and safe. The Arctic and Northern Policy Framework gives us a roadmap to achieve this vision. There are clear priorities and actions set out by the federal government and its partners to:
- nurture healthy families and communities
- invest in the energy, transportation and communications infrastructure that northern and Arctic governments, economies and communities need
- create jobs, foster innovation and grow Arctic and northern economies
- support science, knowledge and research that is meaningful for communities and for decision-making
- face the effects of climate change and support healthy ecosystems in the Arctic and North
- ensure that Canada and our northern and Arctic residents are safe, secure and well-defended
- restore Canada's place as an international Arctic leader
- advance reconciliation and improve relationships between Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples
For the federal government, the framework's goals will guide investments and activities, through 2030. Implementing the Arctic and Northern Policy Framework will require collaborative approaches. Our government recognizes that 'made in Ottawa' policies have not been successful. The new approach puts the future into the hands of the people who live there to realize the promise of the Arctic and the North. Through the co-development of the framework, and by working in partnership to realize its vision and implement its goals and objectives, this initiative will advance reconciliation and renew Canada's relationship with Inuit, First Nations, Métis and support the non-Indigenous residents of Canada's Arctic and North.
A crucial element of this innovative, cooperative form of policy making is the inclusion of chapters from our Indigenous, territorial and provincial partners. Through these chapters, our partners speak directly to Canadians and to the world, expressing their own visions, aspirations and priorities. These critical components of the Arctic and Northern Policy Framework map out areas of present and future collaboration between partners and the Government of Canada, and will provide guidance on the implementation of the framework.
In reflecting their priorities and aspirations, these chapters recognize and advance the vision and interests of Inuit, First Nations and Métis peoples. Partners have chosen their own approaches to crafting these chapters. For example, Yukon First Nations and the Government of Yukon have collaborated closely during the development of the Arctic and Northern Policy Framework, and will be producing separate chapters that speak to their mutual as well as distinct interests. First Nations and Métis worked with the Government of the Northwest Territories to draft the Northwest Territories chapter of the framework.
Inuit Nunangat is the Inuit homeland in Canada. Inuit are the majority population in this distinct geographic, cultural, and political region. In order to respect and support Inuit self-determination, an Inuit Nunangat chapter was developed as an Inuit-Crown Partnership Committee deliverable. This chapter will guide how Arctic and Northern Policy Framework goals and objectives are implemented in Inuit Nunangat. This will ensure that the framework respects Inuit rights and that an Inuit Nunangat approach is utilized in the development and implementation of federal policies and programs that are intended to benefit Inuit, creating efficiencies that in turn benefit all Canadians.
Territorial governments have authored chapters setting out their priorities for new investments and approaches in areas such as economic development, infrastructure and post-secondary education. Yukon, Northwest Territories and Nunavut are also contributing a pan-territorial chapter that articulates their common challenges and opportunities. Drawing on the 2017 Pan-Territorial Vision for Sustainable Development, the territorial governments offer their vision for how the Arctic and Northern Policy Framework can support strong and healthy communities, based on a foundation of responsible resource development, economic diversification, infrastructure and innovation.
The next phase of framework co-development will focus on implementation, investment strategies and governance, moving towards more integrated federal-territorial-provincial and Indigenous approaches to challenges and opportunities in Canada's Arctic and North. Partner chapters will be integral to this next step towards improving the quality of life for our Arctic and Northern residents, especially for Indigenous peoples.
On the front lines of climate change…
The Canadian North is warming at about 3 times the global average rate, which is affecting the land, biodiversity, cultures and traditions.Footnote 1 At the same time, climate change and technology are making the Arctic more accessible.
The region has become an important crossroad where issues of climate change, international trade and global security meet. As melting sea ice opens shipping routes, it is also putting the rich wealth of northern natural resources within reach. Increased commercial and tourism interests also bring increased safety and security challenges that include search and rescue and human-created disasters.
By forging new partnerships, the framework will help address the massive implications of climate change for individuals, communities, businesses and governments alike, and ensure a more sustainable future for northerners.
…and a changing world
Unlike previous Arctic and northern policies, the framework better aligns Canada's current national and international policy objectives with the priorities of Indigenous peoples and of northerners. As the region undergoes rapid environmental change and international interest surges, Canada must demonstrate renewed Arctic leadership.
The Government of Canada will continue to support the co-operative, rules-based international order that has served national and global interests by fostering peace, security and stability for the circumpolar Arctic. Canada will also continue to ensure that the Canadian Arctic and North and its people are safe, secure and well defended. As part of achieving this goal, Canada has committed to increasing Search and Rescue reaction and responsiveness to emergencies for Arctic residents and visitors.
What have we done so far?
The framework and its chapters provide a foundation for future cooperation between the Government of Canada and its Arctic and Northern partners.
The time has arrived to put the goals and objectives into action. The Government of Canada has already begun to realize the framework's vision of thriving, strong and safe communities, and made progress on the priorities identified in the chapters developed by Indigenous, territorial and provincial partners. The following provides just some examples of Canada's commitment to responding to the priorities of partners and the needs and aspirations of our Arctic and Northern residents.
Investments to support better, more relevant and accessible education have been identified in the Inuit Nunangat and Northwest Territories chapters and by Yukon Government. The 2019 federal budget included:
- funding for a task force to study post-secondary education, which will make recommendations on a robust system of higher education in the Arctic and North
- support for culturally-appropriate and community-developed courses for Indigenous and non-Indigenous northern students through the Dechinta Centre for Research and Learning
- an Inuit-led post-secondary education strategy
As well, a new science building at Yukon College will be built to support the goal of transforming this institution into Canada's first university in the North.
To build stronger communities, there is funding for community-led food production projects and skills training for local and Indigenous food production systems. Recent federal investments and policy development undertaken in cooperation with Indigenous peoples will help strengthen food security in Arctic and northern communities and reinforce Indigenous connections with wildlife and the land, as called for in the Inuit Nunangat chapter. The Government of Canada has recently invested $62.6 million over 5 years starting in fiscal year 2019 to 2020, with $10.4 million ongoing to support changes to the Nutrition North program, including a Harvesters Support Grant to help lower the high costs associated with traditional hunting and harvesting activities, which are an important source of healthy, traditional food. Canada and Inuit have also established an Inuit-Crown Food Security working group to focus on food security and work towards a sustainable food system in Inuit Nunangat.
As stated in the Northwest Territories chapter, growing a diversified and sustainable economy is vital to cushioning the northern economy from boom and bust cycles. The federal Jobs and Tourism Initiative will support cultural exchange and expand trade opportunities, while the new Inclusive Diversification and Economic Advancement in the North initiative will provide funds for a wider range of infrastructure such as roads and visitors centres.
Funding has been allocated for scientific research in the North, including for advancing Canada's claim to its continental shelf in both the Arctic and Atlantic oceans, for the Polar Continental Shelf Program, and for the Eureka Weather Station on Ellesmere Island. In its chapter, the Northwest Territories identifies the achieving of major advances in the remediation of reclamation sites following resource development as an environmental priority; cleaning up old mine sites of debris and toxic materials will be funded under the Northern Abandoned Mine Reclamation Program.
New transportation infrastructure funding has been identified by all partner chapters as crucial to improving safety and fostering economic and social development. Canada is investing $71.7 million in federal funding through Canada's National Trade Corridors Fund for four Nunavut transportation projects, including preparatory work on the Grays Bay Road and Port Project and an expansion of the Rankin Inlet airport terminal building capacity. Funding for priority action items identified in the Northwest Territories chapter was included in the 2019 federal budget investments in support of the eventual framework. For example, planning for the proposed Taltson hydroelectricity expansion project in the Northwest Territories, identified as a priority infrastructure project, is funded starting in 2019. There is also a commitment for long-awaited, universal high-speed internet in remote and northern communities. Delivering high-speed internet to these communities will help businesses grow, create new jobs and connect people to the resources, services and information they need to build a better future. It is a key step to closing the gap in the quality of life experienced by Arctic and northern residents and other Canadians. As part of its commitment to support new protection for the High Arctic and create opportunities for Inuit, the Government of Canada is providing infrastructure investments totaling over $190 million to build multi-use buildings, food processing units and harbours.
Canada's international interests are supported through funding for the first Arctic Council-related permanent secretariat in Canada (for the Sustainable Development Working Group), increasing the participation of northerners in Arctic Council and Arctic research activities and providing northern youth with international learning opportunities.
The Inuit Nunangat chapter singles out mental health and closing gaps in social and economic well-being between Inuit and other Canadians as central to developing strong communities and advancing reconciliation. In partnership with Inuit organizations, Canada continues to invest towards this goal, including: new addictions treatment facilities in Nunavut and Nunavik with an emphasis on suicide prevention as well as significant new funding dedicated to health and social services for Inuit children.
Our future
The Arctic and Northern Policy Framework is ambitious and has just over 10 years to translate its goals and objectives into reality. In that time, the Government of Canada and its partners will close the gaps that exist between this region, particularly in relation to its Indigenous peoples, and the rest of the country.
Canada sees a future in which the people of the Arctic and North are full participants in Canadian society, with access to the same services, opportunities and standards of living as those enjoyed by other Canadians. This ambition will require greater effort, focus, trust and collaboration amongst partners.
Other circumpolar nations are making significant investments to make their Arctic regions part of the global community. Supporting Canadian initiatives to keep pace with international efforts will bring increased opportunities, health and well-being to Indigenous peoples and northerners.
Indigenous and Northern leaders have offered their best innovative, adaptive policy solutions that call for trust, inclusiveness and transparency. We can do no less than to respond with integrity, collaboration and openness. Building on these new partnerships, the Arctic and Northern Policy Framework provides a long-term foundation for transformative change, benefiting our Arctic, its Indigenous peoples, northern residents and all Canadians.
The Honourable Carolyn Bennett,
Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs
""The simple fact is that Arctic strategies throughout my lifetime have rarely matched or addressed the magnitude of the basic gaps between what exists in the Arctic and what other Canadians take for granted.""
— Mary Simon, Interim report on the Shared Arctic Leadership Model
Our vision
Strong, self-reliant people and communities working together for a vibrant, prosperous and sustainable Arctic and northern region at home and abroad, while expressing Canada's enduring Arctic sovereignty.
On December 20, 2016, the Government of Canada announced that a new Arctic Policy Framework would be co-developed in collaboration with Indigenous, territorial and provincial partners.Footnote 2
Canada recognizes that what has been done before has not succeeded in building a strong, sustainable region where most people share in the opportunities expected by most Canadians. Insufficient physical and social infrastructure has hindered opportunities for growth and prosperity in the region.
Doing what we have done before as a nation has not closed the gaps in well-being between Arctic and northern people and the rest of the country, so in trying to close those gaps, we have taken an approach that has not been tried before. Inspired by the consensus traditions of Arctic and northern Indigenous peoples, the federal government sought to engage representatives of territories, provinces, and Indigenous peoples as partners in the development of this policy framework. All have made considerable contributions. There is not unanimous agreement on all the issues, but robust and respectful discussion has shaped this document.
This federal framework is informed by extensive engagement, including:
- regional roundtables held in Arctic and northern communities
- interest-based roundtables
- a public submissions process
The voices of people who took part in these engagements are included here, as well as in the other integral parts of the framework which describe:
- Canada's international Arctic policy
- Canada's commitment to safety, security and defence in the region
- the distinctive needs and opportunities of:territoriesprovincesArctic and Northern Indigenous peoples of Canada
These sections provide further detail on priorities, aspirations, and potential actions to be implemented under the framework.
The Government of Canada committed to co-develop an ""Arctic Policy Framework"" with:
- Inuit
- First Nations
- Métis
- territorial governments
- the governments of Manitoba, Quebec and Newfoundland and Labrador
The area covered by the word ""Arctic"" has many definitions. As we worked together on the policy framework, several partners, including First Nations in Yukon as well as First Nations and Métis in the Northwest Territories, expressed concerns that they did not feel included in the term ""Arctic."" Inuit also drew attention to the way in which terms can include and exclude. Often, strategies, policies, programming and investments targeted for the ""North"" have been directed towards the three territories and excluded Inuit. In response to these concerns, Canada's vision for the framework takes into account both the ""Arctic"" and ""Northern"" character of the region and those who live there; it is a policy framework for Canada's Arctic and North that includes the entirety of Inuit Nunangat — the Inuvialuit Settlement Region in the Northwest Territories, Labrador's Nunatsiavut region, the territory of Nunavik in Quebec, and Nunavut — the Inuit homeland in Canada.Footnote 3
In developing this framework, we have built on the extensive work already done by Indigenous, territorial and provincial partners. This includes the Pan-Territorial Vision for Sustainable Development, which is foundational to the framework.
The Pan-Territorial Vision, released by the territorial governments in 2017, reinforces the importance of resource development, economic diversification, improved infrastructure and innovation in building strong territorial economies and increasing self-reliance.
Other key policy initiatives that have contributed to the development of the framework include:
- strategies developed by Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami such as:National Inuit Suicide Prevention StrategyNational Inuit Strategy for Research
- the Parnasimautik Consultation Report produced by Nunavik Inuit
- the Government of Quebec's Plan Nord
- the work of the Look North steering committee appointed by the Government of Manitoba
""Every Northerner deserves the opportunity to experience wellness and the strength of community that characterizes Canadians. Economic development and diversification are foundational to this goal.""
— Pan-Territorial Vision for Sustainable Development
Our partners have helped us to understand and reflect the unique opportunities and challenges within the different regions, jurisdictional responsibilities and treaty rights across the Arctic and the North. The ongoing collaboration required to make this work is essential to the framework's successful implementation.
Together with the people and governments of the Arctic and the North, we will use domestic and international policies and investments to help realize the potential of the region and those who live there.
Another important contribution to this framework was made by Mary Simon, the Special Representative of the Minister of Indigenous and Northern Affairs, who advised the federal government on the most pressing issues facing the region. As Ms. Simon noted in her final report on shared Arctic leadership, there is a ""long history of visions, action plans, strategies and initiatives being devised 'for the North' and not 'with the North'."" This is why this framework has been co-developed for the North, in partnership with the North, to reflect the needs and priorities of the North.
""Nothing about us, without us"" is the essential principle that weaves federal, territorial, provincial and Indigenous institutions and interests together for mutual success. The Arctic and Northern Policy Framework is a response to change in the region. The framework represents an opportunity for Arctic and northern people, and their institutions, municipalities, organizations and governments, to come together with the federal government to shape and direct change toward better outcomes. Together, we can achieve our vision of strong, self-reliant people and communities working together for a vibrant, prosperous and sustainable Arctic and northern region at home and abroad, while expressing Canada's enduring Arctic sovereignty.
Our past
The Government of Canada is committed to building trust with our Arctic and northern partners.
To do so, we must first:
- begin to acknowledge the damaging aspects of our shared past
- face the challenges and opportunities of our shared present
- advance a vision of a shared, collaborative and brighter future
Prior to contact with non-Indigenous peoples, the first peoples had already developed sophisticated technologies, flourishing trading networks, and a rich and diverse array of innovative practices that allowed them to live well in difficult conditions.
The Inuit lived mostly on the coast, and developed innovative watercraft and hunting gear that enabled them to hunt game as large as bowhead whales. First Nations peoples tended to live inland, using both land and freshwater bodies; they developed watercraft suited to lakes and rivers and snowshoes that allowed them to use the land during long northern winters; and they followed the huge caribou herds that migrated between treeline and tundra.
Non-Indigenous people first came north in search of trade and trade routes, and in search of resources such as furs and gold. Most of the early contacts were brief, but over time the initial phase of first encounters and co-operation was followed by more prolonged and extensive contact, increasing numbers of newcomers, and eventually a period of profoundly damaging domination and colonization.
The impacts of colonialism in the Arctic and the North affected Indigenous peoples in many ways, including diseases, cultural assimilation including through residential schools, coerced relocation, and the drawing of international boundaries severing familial and cultural ties.
""There must be a system set up where the Indian people have some control over the programs that affect us. This control must not be just in the Administration of the program — but in the planning. If the idea behind the program is wrong, then we are wasting money, and people, trying to make it work.""
— Council for Yukon Indians, Together Today for Our Children Tomorrow, 1973
Modern self-determination in the region has evolved over the last 50 years and formalized with:
- the James Bay and Northern Quebec Agreement, concluded in 1975
- the Inuvialuit Final Agreement, signed in 1984
- the Umbrella Final Agreement for Yukon, finalized in 199011 of the 14 Yukon First Nations have now concluded agreements
- the Gwich'in comprehensive land claim, signed in 1992
- the Nunavut Agreement signed in 1993
- the Sahtu Dene signed in 1993
- the Métis Comprehensive Land Claim Agreement, signed in 1993
- the Tlicho Land Claims and Self-government agreement, signed in 2003
- the Labrador Inuit Land Claims agreement, signed in 2005
- the Nunavik Inuit Land Claim Agreement, signed in 2006
Many of these land claim agreements established innovative forms of co-management by Indigenous peoples and territorial, provincial and federal governments over land, water and other resources.
In addition to the land claim process and renewal of Indigenous self-government, the 20th and early 21st centuries have witnessed a strengthening of public governments in the Arctic and the North.
Territorial governments have become more democratic and attained increased responsibilities. Province-like powers over land and resources were devolved from the federal government to Yukon in 2003 and to the Northwest Territories in 2014. Negotiations with Nunavut over these powers and responsibilities are ongoing.
Each territory and province has developed unique ways to provide services to Indigenous residents and work with Indigenous governments.
- The Government of Yukon works in partnership with the territory's First Nations, including its 11 self-governing First Nations
- The Government of the Northwest Territories collaborates with Indigenous governments through its Intergovernmental Council and through a formalized commitment to Indigenous governments set out in Respect, Recognition, Responsibility: Government of the Northwest Territories' Approach to Engaging with Aboriginal Governments (2012).
- The Government of Nunavut works with regional Inuit associations through working partnerships to advance shared objectives, including provisions of the Nunavut Agreement.
- Drawing upon Indigenous traditions, the Northwest Territories and Nunavut government legislatures are based on a consensus decision-making system.
- The Government of Quebec works with:the Kativik Regional Government, established through the James Bay and Northern Quebec Agreement and elected by all the inhabitants of the Nunavik regionthe Makivik Corporation, also established by the James Bay and Northern Quebec Agreement, which represents the Inuit of Nunavik in their relations with the governments of Quebec and Canada on issues specifically pertaining to their Indigenous rights
At the forefront of this movement towards greater autonomy are the Indigenous peoples of the Circumpolar North. Their efforts to secure self-determination and self-government are influencing Arctic governance in ways that will have a profound impact on the region and its inhabitants in the years to come.
— Arctic Human Development Report (2015)
As an Arctic nation, Canada has long been interested in finding ways to cooperate with other Arctic and non-Arctic states on shared goals and challenges. In 1996 Canada played a key role in the Ottawa Declaration that created the Arctic Council, the pre-eminent forum for international cooperation in the Arctic on sustainable development and environmental protection. Canadian leadership also contributed to the Arctic Council taking the trail-blazing step of including Indigenous peoples' organizations at the Council table; 3 of which include Canadian membership.Footnote 4
Arctic Indigenous peoples have made remarkable contributions to international governance, both inside and outside the Arctic Council. For instance, the Inuit Circumpolar Council's highlighting impacts of global contaminants on Inuit helped mobilize support for the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants.
The legacy of colonization has left deep rifts in the region's social structure. Those rifts are being gradually healed, in part by the reclamation of self-determination. As highlighted in the Arctic Council's Arctic Human Development Reports, ""fate control"", or ""guiding one's own destiny"", is an important element in peoples' well-being. From the agreements already signed with Indigenous peoples, to those still being negotiated, and the devolution of powers to regional governments, the degree of fate control in the Arctic and the North is on the rise. Part of the challenge we currently face is to ensure that fate control comes with the capacity to meaningfully exercise local aspirations.
Our present
""Why, in spite of substantive progress over the past 40 years, including remarkable achievements such as land claims agreements, Constitutional inclusion and precedent-setting court rulings, does the (Canadian) Arctic continue to exhibit the worst national social indicators for basic wellness? Why, with all the hard-earned tools of empowerment, do many individuals and families not feel empowered and healthy?""
— Mary Simon, A New Shared Arctic Leadership Model
Longstanding inequalities in transportation, energy, communications, employment, community infrastructure, health and education continue to disadvantage people, especially Indigenous peoples, in Canada's Arctic and North. These gaps are evident in the socio-economic statistics and indicators for the region, and closing them is a priority for all partners.
A distinctive feature of the region is its high proportion of Indigenous people in the population. This includes Inuit, First Nations and Métis populations. The manner in which the Government of Canada interacts with Indigenous peoples continues to evolve.
The Principles Respecting the Government of Canada's Relationship with Indigenous Peoples affirm that ""The Government of Canada's approach to reconciliation is guided by the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's Calls to Action, constitutional values, and collaboration with Indigenous peoples as well as provincial and territorial governments."" Inuit and the federal government have developed the Inuit Nunangat Declaration and formed an Inuit-Crown Partnership Committee to jointly advance shared priorities. These include the implementation of Inuit land claims agreements, and the implementation of reconciliation measures between Inuit and the Government of Canada.
The federal government agrees with the people of the Arctic and the North that they must play a greater part in governing the region — domestically and internationally. In addition to land claim and self-government agreements, devolution agreements have been signed with the Northwest Territories and Yukon, transferring some authorities to their respective territorial governments, and another such agreement is being negotiated with Nunavut. Relationships that better recognize the rights and aspirations of people in the region have also been negotiated with sectors other than government. Benefit and partnership agreements with local communities have been developed in the resource sector, and successful partnerships have been established with researchers, and with non-governmental organizations.
The Arctic and North has what is described as a mixed economy: some people depend on traditional economies of hunting, fishing, and gathering, others depend on a wage economy, and some depend on both. The cultures and lifestyles of the peoples of the region provide them not only with subsistence and cultural continuity and strength, but also a bridge to the wage economy.
Despite the poor communications infrastructure in many communities, connectivity is increasingly important to the region.
- Students in Nunavut can connect to students throughout Inuit Nunungat
- A telehealth network links 14 Yukon communities
- Yellowknife's booming tourism industry is transformed by visitors' social media posts
- Telehealth is providing an opportunity to close gaps within the care provided to patients in Labrador
- Remote presence technology is allowing people on the northern coast of Labrador to receive some health-care services in their home communities
However, though there have been significant advances, many northern communities still have slow internet connections and no cell phone service, and priority within networks must be kept for vital services such as telehealth.
""…latent mineral potential of the north is perhaps still the single most likely source of long-term northern prosperity.""
— Look North Report and Action Plan for Manitoba's Northern Economy
Responsible, sustainable resource development and job creation are key to the economy of the region, and a source of prosperity for its communities and residents. Indigenous-owned businesses have for many years been providing resource industries with workers and services, and now Indigenous peoples are also moving into ownership positions in resource development businesses. Indigenous ownership, investment and participation in the resource industry are essential to the success of this sector and a means of economic reconciliation with Indigenous peoples.
Resource projects provide:
- education
- training and employment opportunities in communities
- direct Indigenous participation in supply and services business development
Looking to the future, there is no force likely to reshape the Arctic and the North greater than climate change. Globally, the region is amongst the most affected by climate change, which is redefining the environmental, social and economic landscape, both below the tree line and on the tundra. Arctic ecosystems are at a disproportionately high risk of experiencing the adverse effects of global warming.
The circumpolar Arctic is warming 2 to 3 times more rapidly than the global average, even though the region is not a leading source of greenhouse gas emissions.Footnote 5 According to Canada's Changing Climate Report, 2019, northern warming will continue for both low and high global greenhouse gas emission trajectories. The high scenario projects that annual average temperatures could increase 4 times as much as under the low scenario, and that events such as extreme precipitation could be 4 times as common.
Both scenarios would see accelerating loss of seasonal sea ice across Canada's Arctic, with extensive sea ice-free periods projected by mid-century for the Canadian Arctic and Hudson Bay, thawing permafrost causing irreversible changes to the landscape, a changed distribution of species, changing patterns of precipitation and more frequent wildfires.
Indigenous communities are particularly affected: traditional food sources are disappearing; ice conditions are becoming unpredictable and therefore dangerous for travel by hunters using either dogsled or snowmobile; and melting ice and rising sea levels are exposing communities to destructive coastal erosion and costly damage to infrastructure.
The greenhouse gases driving climate change are also making the water more acidic, which has been shown to have negative effects on some marine life. Considering the depth and irreversible nature of changes brought about by climate change in the region, Indigenous peoples are finding their cultural and social well-being affected at unprecedented rates.
For peoples closely connected to the land, ways of knowing are challenged to keep pace with the change around them. This is affecting cultural and social norms, such as engaging youth on the land, accessing country foods, gathering medicinal plants and protecting water sources. Indigenous communities need tools and knowledge that are locally and culturally appropriate to adapt to these urgent issues.
If there is a single argument for a collaborative approach to a shared Arctic and northern future, it is the shared and complex challenges posed by climate change. The response of all partners to this challenge must be no less transformative in scale, scope or duration.
As the sea-ice pack recedes and cold-weather technologies improve, the Arctic and the North region are also becoming increasingly accessible for a broad range of activities, including:
- fishing
- tourism
- scientific research
- shipping, both small and large vessels
- other commercial activities
Increasing numbers of domestic and international resource developers are being drawn to the region, resulting in a mix of optimism about economic prospects and concerns about potential environmental, social and security impacts. Higher levels of activity also increase the acute security risks associated with irregular movements of people and goods, the pursuit of foreign interests and human-induced disasters. As a whole, these changes highlight the importance of enhancing situational awareness across the region, and of promoting research and observation, including charting and mapping, that will provide the information necessary for sound decision-making.
A collaborative approach to climate change research is underway in the region, bringing together Inuit organizations, northern communities, federal and provincial agencies and the private sector. This effort is directed at understanding how climate change will affect communities and biodiversity. However, the current lack of baseline data poses major challenges to evidence-based decision-making. The responsible use of data can help cultivate a better understanding of the 'big picture' of environmental issues, contributing to the development of informed, data-driven policy and decisions that can help Arctic and northern communities build resiliency in the face of climate change.
Other currents are also driving change in the lives of Arctic and northern people. The place of the Arctic in the global consciousness has changed enormously over the past few years.
- Growing global interest in the region has been shown by several non-Arctic states and actors in Europe and Asia that have developed Arctic policies or strategies.
- Increased interest in the Arctic reflects concern about the global impacts of climate-driven changes in the region, including its increasing strategic and military importance.
There are already national and international efforts to ensure that growing international interest does not lead to additional problems for people in the region. For instance, the International Maritime Organization's Polar Code has mandated that larger ships travelling in polar waters are better equipped than previously, and their crews better prepared.
In particular, the idea of the ""Northwest Passage"" continues to stir the imagination of people around the world. While transiting the various waterways that are commonly referred to as the ""Northwest Passage"" may be increasingly feasible at certain times of the year due to diminishing ice coverage, extremely variable ice conditions continue to make navigation difficult and hazardous. Unregulated vessel traffic and accidents could have a devastating impact on Arctic and northern people and the unique environment in which they live. As these waterways are Canada's internal waters, Canada will continue to manage vessel traffic within our national waters to ensure that navigation is conducted in accordance with our rigorous safety and environmental protection standards.
There are robust rules, norms and institutions in place that guide international affairs.
- The Arctic Council and other multilateral forums such as the Arctic Coast Guard Forum, Arctic Economic Council and various United Nations organizations, including the International Maritime Organization, make decisions affecting the region
- An extensive international legal framework applies to the Arctic Ocean, including the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea
- Canada is also a signatory to several legally-binding international agreements that address Arctic-specific issues
- Canada has bilateral relationships in place with other Arctic states to address issues of a bilateral nature
Territorial and provincial governments and Indigenous partners are regularly engaged in the development of Canada's international Arctic policy through a well-established mechanism, and are often members of the Canadian delegation to international meetings and negotiations. Canada strongly believes that the rules-based international order in the Arctic and the North has been beneficial to national and global interests by helping to foster peace, security and stability for the region.
Through the wide range of activities undertaken by the Government of Canada, its partners and local communities, Canada's enduring sovereignty over its Arctic and northern lands and waters is continually expressed. Canada's sovereignty over the region is long-standing, well-established and based on historic title, and founded in part on the presence of Inuit and First Nations since time immemorial.
The Canadian Armed Forces play a key role in demonstrating Canada's sovereignty across all of its territory. In the Arctic and the North, this is undertaken through:
- an established and permanent presence, with the Joint Task Force — North headquarters in Yellowknife, Northwest Territories
- detachments in Iqaluit, Nunavut and Whitehorse, Yukon
- the 5 Wing Goose Bay base in Labrador which protects North American airspace and also supports military training
- the Canadian Rangers which serve as the military's eyes and ears in remote and northern communities.
The Canadian Armed Forces conduct:
- regular operations and exercises in the Arctic and the North to enhance their ability to operate and demonstrate presence
- air, land and sea patrols
- air and sea search and rescue activities
- monitor and control airspace through the North American Aerospace Defence Command (NORAD) network
- work with government and community partners to ensure safety and security in the region.
What we heard and what we know
Broad engagement with Arctic and northern people and other interested Canadians was an important element in the co-development of this document. The engagement helped shape the content of this framework, as did the work undertaken by territorial, provincial and Indigenous partners in developing their own priorities. This includes foundational documents developed by public governments, such as the Pan-Territorial Vision for Sustainable Development, as well as those of Indigenous governments and organizations.
""To create a better North for our children, the focus needs to be on what forms of knowledge and skills exist within our communities and how the federal government can assist in building upon and supporting these strengths. This means focusing on what we have versus focusing on what we lack, and valuing our existing capacity over voices that tell us we are not capable.""
— ""We Are One Mind"" report, written submission
Arctic and northern leadership
During public engagement on the framework, participants underscored the importance of decision-making about the Arctic and north moving closer to the region. The need for Arctic and northern leadership in crafting solutions, and the necessity of stable and accessible funding for federal programming, were often given as conditions for progress on regional challenges. Building capacity in regional organizations was also identified as a key part of developing leadership.
Participants highlighted the importance of building upon previous strategies, policies and agreements, notably land claim agreements and Canada's commitment to fully implement the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. They want to see full implementation of economic, social and cultural rights, as laid out in the land claims and in the declaration. They also want to see implementation of provisions related to economic development and land use planning.
Strong people and communities
Views expressed through the engagement sessions varied widely, but for many participants the theme of ""strong Arctic and northern people and communities"" was seen as the most central to the development of the new Arctic and Northern Policy Framework for Canada. Institutions and services rooted in local cultures and language were a widespread prescription for addressing social challenges, and for building strong people and communities. There was concern about the erosion of Indigenous languages, and a demand for programs that would assist with the revitalization of language and culture.
- In 2014, about 22% of Northwest Territories households indicated that they often or sometimes worried that food would run out before they had money to buy more
- Just under 70% of Inuit households in Nunavut are food insecure
Life expectancy is considered one of the most fundamental indicators of the overall health and wellness of a population, given that it is influenced by a range of factors including access to health care, nutrition, living conditions and lifestyle. Gaps are stark and striking. For instance, life expectancy for Inuit in Canada is 72.4 years versus 82.9 years for Canada's non-Indigenous population.
- 52% of Inuit in Inuit Nunangat live in crowded homes, which are associated with high rates of communicable disease such as tuberculosis, as well as other challenges, compared to 9% of Canadians overall
- In 2016 18% of Northwest Territories households required major repairs compared to the Canadian rate of 6.5%
References to social challenges, and especially those affecting the Indigenous peoples of the region, were common during the framework engagement sessions. Statistics make it clear that not everybody is similarly disadvantaged. For instance, income inequality does not only exist between the Arctic and the North and the rest of Canada; there is also considerable income inequality within the region itself. The median before-tax individual income for Inuit in Inuit Nunangat is 75% lower than for non-Indigenous residents.
While some of the highest median and average incomes in Canada are found in the region, this should not mask the fact that the costs of living and the rates of poverty and food insecurity are also among the highest in the country. In 2017, for instance, the Nunatsiavut Government Household Food Security Survey identified that food insecure households in Nunatsiavut are over 4 times the level reported in Newfoundland and Labrador, and over 5 times the level of food insecurity in Canada overall.
The deep and ongoing impact on Indigenous peoples of the residential school experience and the broader colonial legacy were consistent themes at regional roundtables, especially when participants spoke of language and culture, education and Indigenous knowledge. Some participants called upon the framework to support the implementation of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission Calls to Action. Links have been made between the intergenerational trauma caused by the impacts of the residential school system and the high rates of substance abuse and suicide in Indigenous populations.
""For many Yukon First Nations, the legacy of colonization continues and the impacts are both real and present. The underlying mental illness experienced by many First Nations is a normal human response to very abnormal conditions brought on by intergenerational impacts of colonization.""
— Yukon First Nations Mental Wellness Workbook
Education and skills development, including early childhood education, improvements in elementary, secondary and post-secondary education, access to higher education as well as the need to enhance opportunities for local higher education in the region, were raised in regional roundtables and other forms of engagement. In written submissions and during stakeholder roundtables, industry representatives talked about the need for more qualified local workers, and about matching education and training with job opportunities. Youth similarly saw education as a path to participating in the local economy, and called for higher-quality education. Participants in engagement sessions described how students from the region graduating with high school diplomas found that their available selection of high school courses or levels of knowledge did not match the requirements of post-secondary education.
- 34% of Inuit in Inuit Nunangat aged 25 to 64 have a high school diploma compared to 86% of Canadians aged 25 to 64 with a high school diploma
- In 2016, nearly three-quarters, 74%, of 25 to 64 year old Northwest Territories non-Indigenous residents had a postsecondary certificate, diploma or degree compared to 43% of Indigenous peoples
""Employment and education are inextricably linked, with 83 per cent of residents 15 years of age and older with post-secondary education having a job, compared to an employment rate of 49 per cent for those without a post-secondary diploma, certificate or degree. Employment and education also have strong linkages to reduced issues related to health, crime and housing.""
— Mandate of the Government of the Northwest Territories 2016–2019 (revised)
The provision of health-care services can be challenging in the Arctic and the North due to the lack of infrastructure and trained professionals, the small populations spread out over vast distances and the need to deliver services in an inclusive, culturally appropriate and responsive manner. Access to health care in the region is currently not comparable to the average Canadian's access to high quality care.
- Hospitals and specialized health services are often not locally available
- Many people are forced to fly out from their home communities to access specialized care, or to give birth
In addition to facing barriers to care, people face disproportionate health challenges.
- In 2014, the rate of new or retreatment cases of tuberculosis was almost 50 times higher in the Inuit population than in the Canadian population overall
Mental health facilities and services are also generally lacking. The severity of mental health challenges in Arctic and northern communities, including the unacceptably high rate of suicide among Indigenous peoples (particularly youth), was a common theme at regional engagement sessions. For example, the rate of self-injury hospitalizations in Labrador is 231 per 100,000. That is more than 3 times the Canadian average. These health outcomes are further complicated by social determinants of health, such as overcrowded housing, high unemployment and low formal education levels.
The importance of local partnerships with municipalities, regional Indigenous associations and development corporations, chambers of commerce and others emerged at roundtable discussions and in written submissions. Local governments, including Indigenous governments and institutions, play a special role in a region which includes urban centres as well as many smaller communities dispersed over large areas.
Municipalities and other forms of local and regional government play key roles in developing and supporting Arctic and northern communities, and are integral to addressing challenges such as housing, health and education.Footnote 6 Many communities are already taking actions that contribute to the goals and objectives of this framework.
""Northern and remote communities play a critical role in delivering essential services. Working with citizens, the private sector, civil society and other orders of government, Arctic municipalities improve the social, economic and environmental well-being of their communities.""
— Jenny Gerbasi, President, Federation of Canadian Municipalities, written submission
Comprehensive infrastructure
Infrastructure concerns were a common theme in engagement, including the need for transformative investments in infrastructure, rather than a remedial approach that only perpetuates a state of crisis.
Almost everyone who spoke about infrastructure mentioned reliable broadband access as a priority, given its role in enabling business, research, education, justice and health.
""With only 1 access into Yukon, 1 misstep from a backhoe operator in British Columbia knocks out the internet across the territory. No telehealth, banking, purchasing of gasoline or supplies, on-line education, and general office use — gone in an instant.""
— Association of Yukon Communities, written submission
""'All weather roads, rail, air and broadband were among the most common topics to arise in conversation in the north.""
— Look North report and action plan
Other highlighted infrastructure needs included:
- improved charting and mapping
- energy infrastructure
- better port facilities
- better airport facilities
- reliable rail networks
- roads to access communities and mineral resources
On a more local level, insufficient housing is a chronic problem in many northern communities. The lack of housing is linked to several other poor health and social outcomes.
- In Nunavik, no communities have all-season roads or connection to a regional energy grid, 58% have suitable housing, and 35% have access to a terrestrial backbone for internet communications.
Rather than simply expressing a desire for greater federal investment, communities and organizations emphasized their desire for partnerships and opportunities to play an active and constructive role in infrastructure investments through, for example, financial partnership, as well as the development of business capacity and skills. They noted that new infrastructure must come with a local capacity to maintain it, and that its construction should bring local jobs and wealth. Territorial governments, through their participation in the co-development process and in strategic documents such as the Pan-Territorial Vision for Sustainable Development, have pointed to large-scale infrastructure investments as foundational to creating economic opportunity and prosperity for Indigenous communities.
The Government of Canada has provided funding to restore rail service on the Hudson Bay Railway Line, which is expected to grow into a key transportation and export hub serving both
international markets and northern Canada. The rail line acquisition by the Arctic Gateway Group represents a historic partnership which combines First Nations and community ownership with private sector leadership. Restoration of the rail line opens the door for economic investments and opportunities for the town of Churchill and northern Manitoba residents and reflects a shared priority to strengthen transportation infrastructure for Canada's Arctic and North.
Strong, sustainable and diversified economies
Economic development was often mentioned by participants as a key theme. Territorial and provincial governments emphasized that regional economies will need to be built upon both sustainable resource extraction and the development of other sectors. They also highlighted that entrepreneurial research and innovation will help in strengthening and diversifying their economies.
""Supporting small business development across the Arctic is key to diversifying the economy, creating sustainable industries that are alternatives to extractive industries, and facilitating young people to stay within their communities rather than having to move for employment.""
— Gwich'in Council International, written submission
- The National Aboriginal Economic Development Board estimated in 2016 that the Indigenous peoples employed in the 3 territories could make an additional $1.1 billion in annual income if they had the same education and training as non-Indigenous people working in the territories
At the roundtables, a thriving economy was linked to foundational elements such as a skilled workforce, social and physical infrastructure, diversity and meaningful opportunities. Stakeholders and experts approached economic development issues from differing perspectives. In public submissions, some saw the answer in more support for non-renewable resource development such as mining. In 2017, mining was the largest private sector contributor to the economies of the Northwest Territories and Nunavut: the 6 mines operating in the territories spent over a billion dollars within the jurisdictions. Documents such as the Pan-Territorial Vision for Economic Development, Quebec's Plan Nord, and Manitoba's Look North Report and Action Plan all highlight the place of resource development in supporting a robust economy.
""Responsible [mining] means meeting socio-economic commitments (including economic, employment and community development commitments); acting in an environmentally responsible manner; and protecting the health and safety of our employees and the Peoples of the North.""
— Mission statement, Northwest Territories (NWT) and Nunavut Chamber of Mines
""The benefits of developing a sustainable, community-driven tourism industry range from healthier lifestyles for youth, to cultural preservation, to new economic opportunities for elders and youth.""
— Parnasimautik Consultation Report, Nunavik
Participants from the business community suggested that by articulating a long-term, strategic vision for the Arctic and the North, the Government of Canada would provide greater certainty for industry and incentivize investments in larger-scale projects. Organizations representing Indigenous economic development corporations and small business interests noted needs for increased access to capital and business supports, as well as more supportive federal procurement policies. There was also a common view that economic development could be facilitated through greater access to international markets. Academics called for the identification and development of alternative economic approaches, including innovation, arts and crafts, and traditional or cultural activities. Some representatives of Indigenous and non-governmental organizations cautioned against a reliance on major projects. They stressed the importance of land-based or traditional economic activity, as well as the potential of ""conservation economies"" focused on connections between culture, communities and local ecosystems.
Science and Indigenous knowledge
""For Inuit, economic development must be guided by Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit (Inuit knowledge)….. Taking this approach applies an Inuit worldview to decisions and action that influence Inuit lives""
— P.J. Akeeagok, President, Qikiqtani Inuit Association, in A New Approach to Economic Development in Nunavut, 2018
At regional roundtables, conversations about knowledge creation often focused on the relationship between communities and researchers, as well as the place of Indigenous peoples in research, including the role of Indigenous knowledge. Participants described both science and Indigenous knowledge as valid and equal contributors to knowledge-building and decision-making in the region. Participants also expressed the desire for stronger local and Indigenous involvement in setting and determining research priorities as well as carrying out research. Prioritizing stronger involvement in the research process means that it is crucial to expand the research capacity of communities and strengthen local and regional research infrastructure and institutions. Indigenous knowledge also has an important role in informing international policies that in turn affect Arctic Indigenous peoples.
""Gwich'in need to be directly represented in the key decision-making forums about research to ensure that research is responding to community desires for information into the issues that are important to them. Moreover, there is a need for increased funding to support the collection and analysis of Indigenous knowledge.""
— Gwich'in Tribal Council, written submission
The importance of social science research was also brought forward, as it can provide an essential evidence base for decisions and policies that meet the needs of Arctic, northern and Indigenous communities. For research to give people a full base for decision-making it should include elements which are not only university-led and partnership-based, but also locally-led and accessible though regionally-based institutions. It was also noted that the vast majority of funds spent on Arctic and northern research are spent in the south. Communities want improved sharing of the results and benefits of research with the communities where the research is being conducted. Many of these points brought up in engagement sessions are also emphasised by territorial research documents and Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami's National Inuit Strategy on Research.
Protecting the environment and conserving biodiversity
""For Inuit the purpose of conservation is the creation of socio-economic and cultural equity between Inuit and all other Canadians, while considering reconciliation, climate change, and, ecological integrity.""
— Qikiqtani Inuit Association (Nunavut), written submission
The social and environmental impacts of climate change were recurring themes at all regional roundtables. Those impacts affect a broad range of issues, from infrastructure to housing to security. At stakeholder roundtables, many people felt that adaptation activities should take precedence over mitigation actions in the region, considering its small emissions footprint versus the magnified impacts. Another key message was the need for more robust mitigation activities from southern Canada and major international emitters.
Conservation issues drew a varied response. Some engagement participants emphasized the need to reduce development impacts on wildlife. The harvesting of country foods, particularly caribou herds, provides nutrition, food security and the continuation of traditional practices for many Indigenous peoples. Others expressed concerns over the weight of regulation and its impact on resource development. Co-management of renewable resources was highlighted as a venue for collaborative management that can help integrate different viewpoints. There was a recognition that protected areas are unable to guard Arctic and northern ecosystems against pollution and climate change with distant origins. There was also acknowledgement that a holistic approach to conservation activities can make an overall positive contribution to the region. Suggested options for such an approach included:
- the advancement of concepts such as Indigenous-led conservation and monitoring
- Indigenous protected and conserved areas
- conservation economies, through which conservation becomes an integral aspect of local economies
The global context
""As we see it, the barriers to feeling empowered and healthy are not neatly segmented into 'domestic' and 'international' boxes. As a nation which spans across territorial and international boundaries, the issues that concern Gwich'in are at the same time both local and international.""
— Gwich'in Council International, written submission
There were some consistent key messages on international issues raised by participants from all regions. They included a desire to maintain the circumpolar Arctic as a region of peace and cooperation through efforts to strengthen the international rules and institutions that govern the Arctic. Preserving the role of the Arctic Council as the leading forum for circumpolar cooperation was singled out as a priority by many participants.
Engagement participants would also like to see Canada target its international cooperation in areas that improve socio-economic living conditions. For example, strengthening north-to-north cooperation through forums such as the Arctic Council and at the sub-national level was encouraged, including exchanges of knowledge and best practices on issues such as:
- mental wellness
- education
- Indigenous languages
- renewable energy
Indigenous participants were particularly interested in improved mobility of Indigenous peoples and cultural goods throughout the circumpolar region. Participants called for:
- strengthening the voice of Indigenous peoples in international Arctic forums including increased support for the Indigenous Permanent Participants at the Arctic Council
- Canada to take a strong stand on protecting Indigenous rights to self-determination, pursuing sustainable harvesting of flora and fauna and combatting international efforts that negatively affect these rights
People who spoke or wrote in also expressed a desire to see Canada play a leadership role on the global stage when it comes to addressing climate change, contaminants and other environmental challenges that have a disproportionate impact on the region.
Safety, security and defence
Throughout the engagement process, participants highlighted the transformative role of climate change in increasing commercial interest and activity in the region. Questions around environmental protection and response, safe regional transportation, and search and rescue capabilities were raised as critical issues, especially in the context of a rapidly changing climate.
In response to rapid regional changes, roundtable participants recognized the need for a whole-of-government approach to safety, security and defence. As part of this, increased presence in the region by the Canadian Armed Forces and the Canadian Coast Guard was highlighted as an important response, in conjunction with clear communication and engagement with local people. The Canadian Rangers were identified as an important presence in the region, and support was expressed for enhancing and expanding the Rangers' training and effectiveness. In addition, participants expressed appreciation for the way in which the Canadian Armed Forces consult local communities and Indigenous groups, and called for such collaboration to be continued.
Participants noted that partnering with communities and investing in regional infrastructure will solidify Canada's regional presence while exercising its sovereignty, and that existing partnerships can be expanded through collaboration, information sharing and training.
Indigenous youth
""Youth across the Arctic understand that education is a portal to opportunity. They aspire to a quality education equivalent to other Canadians: an education that also reaffirms the central role of their culture and Indigenous languages in their identity as Canadians. A new Arctic Policy Framework, if it is to separate itself from many previous documents on the future of the Arctic, must speak to these young voices in this era of reconciliation.""
– A New Shared Arctic Leadership Model
Youth are transforming the region by their very numbers: in Canada, the median age is just over 40; in Nunavut, it is just over 26. These booming populations of young people are producing many great successes as artists, as leaders and in other walks of life. However, figures show that there are still many obstacles and challenges to being well, succeeding at school and finding meaningful work.
""To move forward in any aspect in life and in our society, we need to be educated. The youth want to be well with who they are and where they come from. Youth also understand the importance of quality, formal education so they can become active members of their communities and society and have access to all levels of employment in the communities, region or elsewhere if that is what they choose.""
— Qarjuit Youth Council, Nunavik
Today's young Indigenous leaders are eager to build upon the work of previous generations. As stated in the report We Are One Mind, Perspectives from Emerging Indigenous Leaders on the Arctic Policy Framework, the Arctic and Northern Policy Framework must be people-centric to be effective. The report, which was developed by the Indigenous youth collectives Dene Nahjo, Our Voices and Qanak, contains 25 recommendations organized under 3 themes:
- Northerners leading northern policy engagement
- Investing in land, language and culture for future generations and as the basis for a healthy society
- Healthy lands, healthy economies
The report urges the federal and territorial governments to act in a timely manner to resolve existing unsettled land claims and self-government agreements. It recommends the establishment of a ministerial working group to review federal legislative impediments that exclude northerners from accessing federal programs or impose inappropriate regulations on people and communities, and recommends that the federal and territorial governments update their consultation frameworks to address gaps and redundancies.
Our future
The Government of Canada and its partners will close the gaps and divides that exist between this region, particularly in relation to its Indigenous peoples, and the rest of the country. The clear and ambitious goals and objectives of this framework point the way to a vibrant, sustainable and prosperous future.
In our shared future, Canada's Arctic and North will no longer be pushed to the margins of the national community.
- Its people will be full participants in Canadian society, with access to the same services, opportunities and standards of living as those enjoyed by other Canadians
- The resources required for their physical and mental wellness will be accessible
We will endeavour to create an environment in the Arctic and North in which youth will get the education they need to thrive, and Indigenous peoples receive the support required for their languages and cultures to be not only maintained, but revitalized.
We will encourage development that is environmentally and socially sustainable, that employs local people and creates wealth in the region. Stewardship of Arctic and northern lands, waters and resources will be accomplished through new and existing measures, including support of Indigenous stewardship and Indigenous protected and conserved areas. The Pikialasorsuaq (North Water polynya) between Canada and Greenland and Thaidene Nëné National Park Reserve in Northwest Territories are 2 examples of proposed Indigenous protected areas.
We will work to fill knowledge gaps in the Arctic and the North in a way that is responsive to the needs of local governments and people, and enables and encourages their participation in all aspects of the research process. We will define knowledge inclusively, embracing the contributions of Indigenous knowledge as well as western science.
We will support a rules-based international order in the Arctic that prioritizes human and environmental security and meaningful engagement of Arctic and northern peoples, especially Indigenous peoples. We will reduce barriers to the freedom of Indigenous peoples to move freely across international boundaries that now separate families and cultures.
Realizing this shared future will mean doing things differently to address persistent social and economic challenges in the Arctic and the North. We know that closing the gaps between the region and the rest of Canada means closing gaps between where decisions and resources are based, and where the needs are. Closing the gaps requires greater effort, focus, trust and collaboration, and more self-determination for the peoples of the region.
Reconciliation with Indigenous peoples
""Recognizing …the disproportionate socio-economic and cultural inequity facing Inuit compared to most other Canadians, and committing to working in partnership to create socio-economic and cultural equity between Inuit and other Canadians. This commitment includes energetically and creatively pursuing the socio-economic, cultural, and environmental conditions of success through the full implementation of land claims agreements as well as reconciliation""
— Inuit Nunangat Declaration on Inuit-Crown Partnership
Ongoing reconciliation with Indigenous peoples is foundational to achieving the goals and objectives of the Arctic and Northern Policy Framework.
The negotiation and full implementation of land claims and self-government agreements are key components of reconciliation. They require recognition within the framework as part of the continuation and renewal of relationships. These continued and renewed relationships come with a strong foundation, including the Principles Respecting the Government of Canada's Relationship with Indigenous Peoples.
In 2015, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau accepted the Final Report of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission on behalf of the Government of Canada and committed to a renewed nation-to-nation relationship with Indigenous peoples based on recognition of rights, respect, co-operation and partnership.
In 2016, the Government of Canada committed to renewing the relationship with First Nations, Inuit and Métis peoples through the creation of permanent bilateral mechanisms.
- All 4 Inuit regions have settled land claims
- Agreements on land and governance rights have been signed with First Nations and Metis across much of their traditional territories in the Arctic and the North
The fundamental instruments that define the Indigenous-Crown relationship are treaties, historic and modern, underpinned by section 35 of the Constitution Act of 1982. Each treaty established a unique relationship between Indigenous peoples and various levels of government. These relationships provide the foundation for a just and lasting reconciliation, founded in the honour of the Crown with federal, provincial and territorial governments. Implementing modern treaties is a shared responsibility, which Canada will work with Indigenous peoples, provinces and territories to realize.
The work of reconciliation is not only happening at the federal level, it has also been undertaken by Indigenous peoples, by Arctic and northern governments and through other mechanisms. Reconciliation in the region is intertwined with political evolution and is ongoing. Progress has been made on this path, led in large part by Indigenous and non-Indigenous citizens who have worked together to secure and implement land and self-government agreements, evolve public governments, and find practical ways to work together for the shared goals of improving the quality of life for their children and sound stewardship of land and resources.
Assuming global leadership
Canada will strengthen its international leadership on Arctic and northern issues at this critical time, as the region undergoes rapid environmental change and international interest surges.
Canada's ambition is to robustly support the rules-based international order in the Arctic, and all its institutions, and to seek ways to strengthen and improve those institutions for the 21st century.
Canada will:
- work collaboratively with Indigenous peoples and territorial and provincial governments in the multilateral forums where decisions that impact the Arctic are made, including the Arctic Council and United Nations organizations
- enhance bilateral cooperation with Arctic and key non-Arctic states and actors
Canadian leadership will be advanced bilaterally and in multilateral forums in order to promote Canadian values and interests such as human and environmental security.
Our shared ambition includes:
- better leveraging our international Arctic engagement to address domestic priorities such as social and economic development
- enhanced knowledge of our Arctic and North
- environmental protection
In a globalized world, many of the issues facing Canada, including in the Arctic and the North, cannot be addressed effectively through domestic action alone. A whole-of-government effort that leverages both domestic and international policy levers is therefore required. For example, economic growth in Canada's Arctic and North can be facilitated through infrastructure investments that increase access to world markets, along with trade commissioner services to help businesses based in the region access international markets and attract and retain foreign direct investment that benefits Northerners and respects Canada's national interest.
Promoting sustainable development
A key international commitment that informs this framework is the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Canada has committed to implementing and measuring progress toward these goals.
The United Nations 2030 Sustainable Development Goals
- End poverty in all its forms everywhere
- End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture
- Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages
- Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all
- Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls
- Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all
- Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all
- Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all
- Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation
- Reduce inequality within and among countries
- Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable
- Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns
- Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts
- Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development
- Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss
- Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels
- Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development
Adopted in 2015, the 2030 Agenda is an ambitious 15-year global framework with 17 goals that cover the economic, social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development, and integrate peace, governance and justice elements. It is universal in nature, meaning that implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals is a commitment to take action domestically within Canada, as well as internationally, to eradicate poverty and leave no one behind.
These goals fit well with what we have heard regarding the need to narrow gaps between Arctic and northern Indigenous peoples and other Canadians. We intend to match our ambition in the framework, domestically and internationally, to the ambition expressed in the Sustainable Development Goals. This ambition is expressed in the framework's goals and objectives, and aligns closely with the Pan-Territorial Vision for Sustainable Development principle that ""the territories will stand together to create long term sustainable development of northern economies."" The Pan-Territorial Vision indicates that this will be achieved through environmentally responsible and sustainable resource development, job creation and economic diversification.
A safe and secure Arctic and North, now and into the future
The qualities that make the Canadian Arctic and North such a special place, its size, climate, and small but vibrant and resilient populations, also pose unique security challenges, making it difficult to maintain situational awareness and respond to emergencies or military threats when and where they occur. These difficulties are often compounded by the effects and accelerating pace of climate change, making the region both environmentally changed and increasingly accessible to a broad range of actors and interests.
To protect the safety and security of people in the region and safeguard the ability to defend the Canadian Arctic and North, and North America now and into the future, a multi-faceted and holistic approach is required. The complexity of the regional security environment places a premium on collaboration amongst all levels of government, Indigenous peoples and local communities, as well as with trusted international partners, and we will continue to improve the ways we work together to keep pace with the evolving challenges.
The Government of Canada is taking steps to augment its Arctic and northern footprint in support of regional safety and security, including through Canada's defence policy Strong, Secure, Engaged, and through key elements of the Oceans Protection Plan. Canada will enhance the Canadian Armed Forces' presence in the region over the long term by setting out the capability investments that will give the Canadian Armed Forces the tools they need to help local people in times of need and to operate effectively in the region.
Under the Oceans Protection Plan, the Canadian Coast Guard will continue to enhance its:
- maritime search and rescue capacity, including through an expanding Coast Guard Arctic Auxiliary
- capacity to respond to maritime environmental emergencies
- icebreaking capacity
- its capacity to contribute to Maritime Domain Awareness
Canada's ability to respond to regional challenges, provide security and ensure compliance with our laws and regulations largely depends on our ability to build and maintain a comprehensive picture of what is happening across the region, as gaps can have life-threatening consequences. For example, increased maritime and cross-border traffic creates new challenges for border enforcement and effective vessel tracking, such as illicit drugs and illegal imports. This is why it is so critical for partners to work together to develop strong domain awareness, including through information sharing, enhanced coordination, the acquisition of new air, land, sea and space-based capabilities, and exploration of innovative solutions to surveillance challenges in the Arctic and the North.
Goals and objectives
Goal 1: Canadian Arctic and northern Indigenous peoples are resilient and healthy
There are unacceptable gaps in health and social development outcomes between Arctic and northern Indigenous peoples and most other Canadians. The poor health outcomes in the region are directly linked to both inadequate access to treatment options and to serious social problems, including:
- a critical shortage of housing
- low educational attainment levels
- high rates of incarceration and unemployment, particularly in smaller communities
Climate-driven changes are worsening the risks to Indigenous peoples in the region, such as travel over traditional routes. As well, a high cost of living and changes in the availability and accessibility of traditional foods have resulted in rising rates of food insecurity. For example, 1 in 2 households in Nunavut are food insecure. Eliminating food insecurity includes both affordable food from the grocery store, as well as having access to traditional food to support a healthy diet, community well-being and connection to local cultures and traditions.
Life expectancy is a key index of a population's wellbeing. Projected life expectancy for Inuit in Canada is 10.5 years below that of Canada's non-Indigenous population. While the most recent Statistics Canada information on First Nations and Métis is not disaggregated by region, at a national level First Nations and Métis were found to have a projected life expectancy rate of approximately 4 to 5 years below that enjoyed by non-Indigenous Canadians.
- One study shows that northern populations suffer from the lowest life expectancy in Canada
- Another study finds that life expectancy is approximately 7 to 12 years lower in areas with a high concentration of Inuit, First Nations and Métis
- Rates of communicable disease and suicide are much higher among Arctic and northern Indigenous populations than elsewhere in Canada
- Violence is being perpetrated against Indigenous women and girls, with the likelihood of violent death being significantly higher for Indigenous than for non-Indigenous women, according to statistics cited in the 2019 final report of the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls
Together, we will close these stark gaps, taking a distinctions-based approach that respects the unique rights, interests and circumstances of Inuit, First Nations and Métis peoples.
Meeting this goal will depend on progress on other objectives, including economic development, public safety, justice and reconciliation. Adaptation and resilience-building measures will be required to respond to the climate-driven change happening now, and projected for the future. Cultural revival will play a role in resilience. Land-based activities and practices will support education, healing and well-being. Solutions advanced in other Arctic states that face similar challenges will also be examined. Strong communities in our North can be supported by the circumpolar exchange of knowledge and best practices. Freer movement of Indigenous peoples and cultural goods across Canada's international boundaries in the Arctic and the North will further strengthen long-standing familial and cultural ties.
Goal 1 objectives
- End poverty
- Eradicate hunger
- Eliminate homelessness and overcrowding
- Reduce suicides
- Strengthen mental and physical wellbeing
- Create an environment in which children will thrive, through a focus on education, culture, health and well-being
- Close the gaps in education outcomes
- Provide ongoing learning and skills development opportunities, including Indigenous-based knowledge and skills
- Strengthen Indigenous cultural and family connections across international boundaries
- Address the systemic causes of all forms of violence against Indigenous women and girls
- End the over-representation of Indigenous peoples in Canada's criminal justice system
- Implement culturally-appropriate approaches to justice issues, such as restorative justice measures and other alternative measures to incarceration
Goal 2: Strengthened infrastructure that closes gaps with other regions of Canada
As a gap experienced by every person in the Arctic and the North, infrastructure is a top priority of this framework. Canada is investing in transformative infrastructure corridors to achieve more efficient and effective communications, clean energy and transportation. We also need to address deficits in weather and climate monitoring, particularly in climate-sensitive sectors. The National Aboriginal Economic Development Board has estimated that every dollar invested in transportation and energy infrastructure can generate more than 10 times that amount.
We commit to creating economic opportunity and prosperity for northerners, and to better enabling Canada's northern and Arctic regions to catch up to other areas of Canada.
There are significant transportation infrastructure deficits in the region.
- Approximately 70 communities are only accessible year-round by air, or seasonally by water or ice roads
- Marine and aviation infrastructure is the gateway for many northern and Arctic communities and needs improvement
The limited transportation infrastructure makes it difficult, time-consuming and expensive to move passengers and goods in and out of communities, and to deliver government programs and services. Infrastructure deficits are also a significant restriction on trade and commerce.
Climate change threatens the resilience of existing infrastructure and presents challenges to constructing new infrastructure. The costs, sustainability and reliability of energy are a concern, with nearly two-thirds of Arctic and northern communities relying exclusively on diesel, which is expensive, difficult to transport and a source of greenhouse gases.
Many communities rely exclusively on satellite for access to internet services; they lack access to the fast, high quality and reliable telecommunications networks that people need to enable economic growth, education, health and research.
Goal 2 objectives
- Investment in significant infrastructure projects
- Fast, reliable, and affordable broadband connectivity for all
- Expand multi-modal transportation infrastructure and operations to connect communities to Canadian and international opportunities and improve access to essential services
- Develop multi-purpose corridors for broadband, energy and transportation, including connections to hydroelectricity grids
- Achieve energy security and sustainability in all communities and improve access to reliable, affordable and clean energy solutions
- Integrate climate change resilience into new and existing infrastructure
- Strengthen community-level infrastructure, including social infrastructure
- Enhance monitoring infrastructure for the collection and use of weather and climate data
Goal 3: Strong, sustainable, diversified and inclusive local and regional economies
A strong economy contributes to the resilience of Arctic and northern communities and sustainable growth that benefits all Canadians. However, northern economic development is challenged by higher operating costs for businesses due to the region's small and dispersed population, sparse infrastructure and higher energy and connectivity costs.
Limited access to formal or higher education, a barrier to local participation in the workforce, especially amongst Indigenous peoples, highlights the need for policies which aim to foster increased mobility as a means of supporting education and employment paths.
For many small businesses, access to professional support, such as banking and legal services, is limited. As stated in the Pan-Territorial Vision for Sustainable Development, ""responsible, sustainable resource development and job creation is the cornerstone of the territorial economies. Indigenous ownership, investment and participation in the resource industry are key to the success of this sector."" There is also a need to grow other areas to help insulate northern economies from the ""boom and bust"" cycle, and to provide more diversity of opportunity for Arctic and northern peoples. This will grow the middle class and build a diverse, prosperous and truly inclusive economy, where all can realize their full potential.
We will support local economies, such as sealing, fishing, hunting and crafts. Measures aimed at fostering innovation, diversification and promoting access to domestic and foreign markets will support both existing and future economic activities.
Achieving sustainable economies will also require the provision of long-term employment and other benefits to Arctic and northern people, along with a central role in decision-making. The resolution of land and governance rights and the negotiation of benefits underpin economic development. Canada is committed to meaningfully consult with Indigenous peoples on resource and infrastructure projects in the decision-making process, in accordance with Aboriginal and treaty rights. Fulfilling consultation obligations while respecting the decision-making roles of Indigenous groups recognized within modern treaties can help realize inclusive economies.
Many areas within the region are expecting growth over the next decade, capitalizing on their considerable economic potential. Much of the growth will come from the natural resource sector, as well as other sectors such as:
- tourism
- commercial fisheries
- cultural industries
Certain economic sectors, including resource development, tourism and shipping, are expected to grow as climate change alters the northern environment, though these activities bring new risks for people, infrastructure and ecosystems and place additional stress on search and rescue and disaster response capacity. To ensure that local and regional economies are able to grow sustainably, climate change considerations will need to be taken into account.
International trade and foreign investment are important contributors to growth, by helping Arctic and northern businesses:
- take advantage of global export opportunities made possible by existing and new free trade agreements
- attract and retain foreign direct investment in a way that enhances economic development and environmental protection while ensuring Canada's national security interests
Goal 3 objectives
- Increase Indigenous participation in the economy
- Grow the northern and Arctic economy, to the benefit of Northerners and all Canadians
- Increase retention of wealth in Canada's Arctic and North
- Reduce income inequality
- Drive innovation and support investments in cold climate resource extraction
- Optimize resource development, including the mining and energy sectors, while ensuring that this development is undertaken in a responsible, sustainable and inclusive manner
- Provide the necessary supports to help businesses grow
- Building on a strong economic base, foster economic diversification through innovation and partnerships
- Enhance opportunities for trade and investment
- Maximize economic opportunities flowing from infrastructure investments
Goal 4: Knowledge and understanding guides decision-making
Canada's Arctic and North is a region of significant interest to scientists and other researchers, domestically and internationally. Ongoing research and observation in the region seek to address knowledge gaps. Mapping and understanding climate change impacts, vulnerabilities and avenues to adaptation and resilience are keys tasks for research. Other tasks range from geological mapping to tracking species distribution to understanding the socio-economic and cultural impacts of development.
Arctic and Northern peoples want those knowledge gaps filled, but they also want changes to the way knowledge is gathered, created and shared. Our approach to Arctic and-northern research will feature:
- stronger regional and Indigenous involvement in the research process, including:setting prioritiesundertaking research itselfenhanced community-based observation
The research agenda will include more social science research to meet the pressing needs of communities. Indigenous knowledge and scientific knowledge will be equally considered in decision-making.
Collaboration at the international level plays a major role in addressing gaps in our knowledge of the region, particularly given the complexities, interconnectedness and costs related to Arctic and northern science.
Internationally, Canada will:
- bolster its efforts to champion Indigenous knowledge
- facilitate stronger international research collaboration
Indigenous knowledge holders as well as academic institutions and research facilities relating to natural sciences, social sciences and health have built an international reputation for high-quality knowledge and research, though more meaningful and equitable partnerships with Indigenous researchers and institutions must be achieved. The Canadian High Arctic Research Station campus in Nunavut is the newest addition to the pan-northern and Arctic network of research infrastructure welcoming scientists from all over the world.
Goal 4 objectives
- Ensure that Arctic and Northern people, including youth and all genders, play a leading role in developing research and other knowledge-creation agendas
- Ensure that Arctic and Northern people have the tools and research infrastructure to participate in all aspects of the knowledge creation process
- Increase support for health, social science and humanities research
- Create and store knowledge in a manner consistent with the self-determination of Indigenous peoples, balancing ethics, accessibility and culture
- Increase international polar science and research collaboration with full inclusion of Indigenous knowledge
- Work with partners to implement their research strategies
- Develop innovative technological solutions on widely-shared community and economic development needs
- Support development of data collection, production and measurement specifically focused on Arctic and Northern populations
- Reduce barriers to accessing research funding for Indigenous knowledge holders and organizations
Goal 5: Canadian Arctic and northern ecosystems are healthy and resilient
Climate change is a lived reality for Canada's Arctic and northern residents. The temperature in the Canadian Arctic has increased at a rate of 2 to 3 times the global average, which has placed immense pressure on Arctic and northern communities, ecosystems and infrastructure.
Rising temperatures are also:
- having widespread impacts on terrestrial and marine ecosystems
- exacerbating the effects of existing threats to biodiversity, such as:habitat shiftsinvasive alien species
Urgent action is needed to:
- mitigate climate change
- adapt to its current and future impacts
- promote and build resilience through efforts that:increase the availability of, and access to, locally relevant information for decision-makingbuild capacity to reduce risk
Environmental data gathered from information and warning services on weather, water, ice, climate and air quality are an important foundation for situational awareness and can be leveraged to better understand the impacts and risks of changing environmental conditions.
Addressing critical gaps in earth observation across Canada's Arctic and North, and adapting these services to the unique context and evolving needs of the region, will be essential to support effective decision-making.
This will enable communities to be:
- more prepared for emergencies
- better informed
- resilient when it comes to facing the challenges posed by climate change
Minimizing other environmental pressures, such as pollution, will help to reduce adverse effects. Sustainable management of natural resources, conservation of biodiversity and the safeguarding and restoration of ecosystems are necessary to protect the Arctic and northern environment and communities. Indigenous peoples continue to play a unique role in stewardship of northern ecosystems, including through guardians programs, which work to protect sensitive areas and species, monitor ecological health and maintain cultural sites.
Some of the most pressing environmental issues affecting Canada's Arctic and North, from climate change to contaminants to marine pollution, cannot be managed through domestic action alone as the sources of the problems largely originate in areas outside of the region. While these environmental issues are global in scope, there is a disproportionate impact on the health of northern Canadians, in particular on Indigenous peoples who live off the land. For this reason, Canada will play a leadership role in advocating for more timely and ambitious international action to address environmental challenges that have an impact on Arctic and northern environments and peoples.
Goal 5 objectives:
- Accelerate and intensify national and international reductions of greenhouse gas emissions and short-lived climate pollutants
- Ensure conservation, restoration and sustainable use of ecosystems and species
- Support sustainable use of species by Indigenous peoples
- Approach the planning, management and development of Arctic and northern environments in a holistic and integrated manner
- Partner with territories, provinces and Indigenous peoples to recognize, manage and conserve culturally and environmentally significant areas
- Facilitate greater understanding of climate change impacts and adaptation options through monitoring and research, including Indigenous-led and community-based approaches
- Enhance support for climate adaptation and resilience efforts
- Enhance understanding of the vulnerabilities of ecosystems and biodiversity and the effects of environmental change
- Ensure safe and environmentally-responsible shipping
- Decommission or remediate all contaminated sites
- Strengthen pollution prevention and mitigation regionally, nationally and internationally
Goal 6: The rules-based international order in the Arctic responds effectively to new challenges and opportunities
The circumpolar Arctic is well-known for its stability and high level of international cooperation, a product of the robust rules-based international order in the Arctic that Canada played an instrumental role in shaping. The rules-based international order is the sum of international rules, norms and institutions that govern international affairs. It benefits the national and global interest by fostering peace and stability for the Arctic; conditions which are necessary for Arctic and northern communities to thrive socially, economically and environmentally.
The international order is not static; it evolves over time to address new opportunities and challenges. The Arctic and the North is in a period of rapid change that is the product of both climate change and changing geopolitical trends. As such, international rules and institutions will need to evolve to address the new challenges and opportunities facing the region. As it has done in the past, Canada will bolster its international leadership at this critical time, in partnership with Northerners and Indigenous peoples, to ensure that the evolving international order is shaped in a manner that protects and promotes Canadian interests and values. These interests and values are widely shared by Arctic states and include:
- improving the lives of Indigenous peoples and Northerners
- protecting the region's fragile environment
- strengthening the voices of Northerners, especially Indigenous peoples
The international rules and institutions that form part of the rules-based international order will also play a critical role in helping Canada resolve our outstanding boundary disputes and continental shelf overlaps in the Arctic.
Goal 6 objectives
- Bolster Canadian leadership in multilateral forums where polar issues are discussed and decided upon
- Enhance the representation and participation of Arctic and northern Canadians in relevant international forums and negotiations
- Strengthen bilateral cooperation with Arctic and key non-Arctic states and actors
- Define more clearly Canada's marine areas and boundaries in the Arctic
Goal 7: The Canadian Arctic and North and its people are safe, secure and well-defended.
In the Arctic and the North, as in the rest of Canada, safety, security and defence are essential prerequisites for healthy communities, strong economies and a sustainable environment. Climate change is having far-reaching effects on the lives and well-being of northerners, threatening food security and the transportation of essential goods and endangering the stability and functioning of delicate ecosystems and critical infrastructure.
As the region becomes increasingly accessible due to the effects of climate change and improvements in cold-weather technologies, the region is emerging as an area of international strategic, military and economic importance, with both Arctic and non-Arctic states expressing a variety of interests in the region's potential.
- Steady increases in domestic and foreign-based tourism, scientific research and commercial activities are being experienced in the Canadian and circumpolar Arctic.
- There is also increased vessel traffic through the various waterways commonly referred to as the ""Northwest Passage,"" which is part of Canada's internal waters.
The relationship between the land and these waterways is unique in Canada's north. For thousands of years, the Inuit have lived on; traveled across; and hunted, fished and trapped in the Canadian Arctic, making no distinction between the frozen land and the frozen sea. These practices continue and remain vital to Inuit culture and the Inuit economy today.
In today's increasingly complex Arctic and northern environment, the continued safety and security of the North depends on strengthened emergency management and community safety, including the enhanced presence and ability to respond of security providers, such as the:
- Canadian Armed Forces
- Royal Canadian Mounted Police
- Canadian Border Services AgencyFootnote 7
Strengthened emergency management requires a coordinated strategy, including enhanced participation of Indigenous representatives; this will be essential in building community resilience and capacity against emergencies and natural disasters.
Northern communities experience multiple risk factors and other challenges that affect their ability to respond to crime issues, such as remote geographical location and limited capacity. Culturally-sensitive crime prevention and community safety planning initiatives build knowledge and capacity that are required in order to support healthy, safe and stronger communities.
Improved situational awareness, including through NORAD and the Maritime Security Operations Centres, will also be key to protecting our north now and into the future. In this context, Canada will:
- continue to demonstrate its sovereignty
- defend North America from conventional and advanced military threats
- protect the integrity and sustainability of our northern economy, environment and critical infrastructure
- ensure a safe and secure transportation system
- safeguard the technological advantage that the Canadian Armed Forces rely on to defend our north
- effectively manage border security
- enhance the ability of the Canadian Coast Guard to help provide partners with essential Maritime Domain Awareness
- support the safety and prosperity of northern peoples and communities
Collaboration among all levels of government, with Indigenous and northern peoples and communities, and with international allies and partners, will be important.
Goal 7 objectives
- Strengthen Canada's cooperation and collaboration with domestic and international partners on safety, security and defence issues
- Enhance Canada's military presence as well as prevent and respond to safety and security incidents in the Arctic and the North
- Strengthen Canada's domain awareness, surveillance and control capabilities in the Arctic and the North
- Enforce Canada's legislative and regulatory frameworks that govern transportation, border integrity and environmental protection in the Arctic and the North
- Increase the whole-of-society emergency management capabilities in Arctic and northern communities
- Support community safety through effective and culturally-appropriate crime prevention initiatives and policing services
Goal 8: Reconciliation supports self-determination and nurtures mutually respectful relationships between Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples
In its final report, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada describes reconciliation as ""establishing and maintaining a mutually respectful relationship between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal peoples in this country. In order for that to happen, there has to be awareness of the past, acknowledgement of the harm that has been inflicted, atonement for the causes and action to change behaviour.""
The Qikiqtani Truth Commission based in Nunavut also called for a new relationship between government and Qikiqtani Inuit grounded in ""awareness and acknowledgement of past wrongs, and commitment on both sides to collaborate in building a better future."" In recent years, the Government of Canada has publicly recognized the negative impacts of its past policies upon Indigenous peoples, for instance through the:
- Statement of Apology to Former Students of Indian Residential Schools in 2008)
- Apology for the Inuit High Arctic relocation in 2010
- Statement of Apology on Behalf of the Government of Canada to Former Students of the Newfoundland and Labrador Residential Schools in 2017
The Government of Canada will continue to redress past wrongs, acknowledge harm and raise awareness. The government is also working to take actions to improve and renew relationships with Indigenous peoples through distinctions-based approaches that respect the unique rights, interests and circumstances of Inuit, First Nations and Métis peoples. The Government of Canada is moving towards the recognition and implementation of rights as the basis for Canada's relationship with Inuit First Nations and Métis. Canada has also committed to exploring new ways of working together, including through the Inuit-Crown Partnership and the other permanent bilateral mechanisms formed to jointly advance shared priorities.
The improvement and devolution of governance to give all people in Canada's Arctic and north more control over their lives will underpin reconciliation, build long-term capacity and contribute to the building of healthier and more resilient communities. The vast majority of Indigenous self-governments are found in the north. Innovative approaches to self-determination have also been established through public governments.
One of the roles of the federal government is to advance self-determination for Canada's Arctic and northern residents, including the devolution of province-like powers to territorial governments. This helps enable a locally-based approach to reconciliation, to be undertaken together by the peoples of the Arctic and north.
In addition to the recognition of rights and innovative forms of governance and collaboration, reconciliation in Canada's Arctic and north means closing the socio-economic gaps that exist between Arctic and northern Indigenous peoples and other Canadians. Canada will work with Indigenous governments and organizations, territories, provinces and other partners to close these gaps. This will be achieved, in part, through the implementation of the:
- Calls to Action of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada
- United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples
- goals and objectives articulated in this framework
Goal 8 objectives
- Honour, uphold and implement the rights of Arctic and northern Indigenous peoples, including those outlined in historic and modern treaties and in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples
- Change federal operating practices and processes in support of increased self-determination and representation of Arctic and northern Indigenous peoples, and recognize the unique operating environment of various Indigenous and public governments in the Arctic and north
- Ensure that Arctic and northern Indigenous peoples have the opportunity, choice and capacity to enter into treaties, agreements and other constructive arrangements with the Crown that provide a foundation for ongoing relations
- Reclaim, revitalize, maintain and strengthen the cultures of Arctic and Northern Indigenous peoples, including their languages and knowledge systems
- Complete outstanding devolution commitments, including the devolution of land, inland waters and resource management in Nunavut
- Work with Indigenous governments and organizations, provinces, territories and other partners to close socioeconomic gaps between Arctic and northern Indigenous peoples and other Canadians
- Continue to redress past wrongs against Indigenous peoples
Conclusion: Next steps
The development of this framework has strengthened collaborative relationships between framework partners and among federal government departments. This development of new ways of working together is, in itself, a significant achievement.
In the second phase of the framework, governance mechanisms will be co-developed through discussions among framework partners, the governments and Indigenous peoples' organizations that worked together on the first part of the framework. These mechanisms will describe how partners will regularly collaborate to share information and assess progress on framework implementation, building on significant developments in governance over the last 50 years. Governance mechanisms will:
- support the jurisdictional and institutional landscape created by devolution, modern treaties and land claim and self-government agreements
- adhere to the principles of partnership articulated in A New Shared Arctic Leadership Model, the final report of Mary Simon, the Minister's Special Representative on Arctic Leadership
- meet partners' expectations for meaningful, ongoing involvement in policy decisions related to their interests
- provide a forum for all partners to be regularly convened for collaborative discussions on implementation of the framework
- commit to reconciliation in the context of renewed federal-provincial-territorial-Indigenous relationships
- ensure that existing fora, such as the Inuit Crown Partnership Committee, the Yukon Forum, and the Intergovernmental Council of the Northwest Territories, are leveraged to assist in implementation
- reflect the authorities and powers of territorial, provincial and Indigenous governments
Financial investment in the framework will be an integral element of its success. Partners will work together to develop an implementation and investment plan. The plan will outline how new investments together with other economic and regulatory levers will be used to contribute to implementation of the framework.
The implementation and investment plan will:
- define new investments
- provide information on how partners' funding initiatives are aligned with and supportive of the goals and objectives described in the ANPF policy statement, including in partner chapters
- provide strategic alignment and flexibility of investments to accommodate the unique nature of 'doing business' in the Arctic and north
- define indicators, data collection and reporting commitments related to specific funding and initiatives
Annex: Principles for the Arctic and Northern Policy Framework
The principles below were developed to provide continuing guidance on implementation of the framework.
- Decisions about the Arctic and the North will be made in partnership with and with the participation of northerners, to reflect the rights, needs and perspectives of northerners
- The rights and jurisdictions of Canada's federal, territorial, provincial Indigenous and municipal governments will be respected
- Development should be sustainable and holistic, integrating social, cultural, economic and environmental considerations
- Ongoing reconciliation with Indigenous peoples, using the work of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission as a starting point, is foundational to success
- As climate change is a lived reality in the region, initiatives will take into account its various impacts, including its impact on Indigenous northerners, who continue to rely on the land and wildlife for their culture, traditional economy, and food security
- Policy and programming will reflect a commitment to diversity and equality, and to the employment of analytical tools such as Gender-Based Analysis Plus to assess potential impacts on diverse groups of people
- The framework will respect a distinctions-based approach to ensure that the unique rights, interests and circumstances of Inuit, Arctic and northern First Nations and Métis are acknowledged, affirmed and implemented
- The Government of Canada recognizes Inuit, First Nations, and Métis as the Indigenous peoples of Canada, consisting of distinct, rights-bearing communities with their own histories, including with the CrownThe work of forming renewed relationships based on the recognition of rights, respect, co-operation and partnership must reflect the unique interests, priorities and circumstances of each people
- Every sector of society, from the private sector to universities and colleges, the not-for-profit sector, community-based organizations and individual Canadians, has an important part to play in building a strong Canadian Arctic and North.
Introduction to partners' chapters
The content in the Arctic and Northern Policy Framework was discussed over the course of more than a year by the partners in the co-development process. The ideas, the aspirations, and the goals and objectives are the result of the meeting of many minds and perspectives. This often meant compromise on the part of governments and Indigenous partners as we strove for consensus. As part of the development of the framework, we decided it was important for partners to be able to express themselves directly, to lay out their visions, aspirations and priorities. While the framework chapters are an integral part of this process, they do not necessarily reflect the views of either the federal government, or of the other partners.

With growing tensions in the Arctic region, the islands are…","Jenis av Rana, foreign minister of the Faroe Islands, was excited on the morning of July 22. In his 25-year-long career as a member of the Faroese Parliament for the Christian Conservative party, he occasionally met with colleagues from Iceland or Greenland or even different Scandinavian countries. But he hadn’t even been foreign minister for a year, when on that Wednesday morning he was preparing to meet U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.
Pompeo was in Copenhagen, and quite untraditionally, had decided to invite the foreign ministers of the self-governing parts of the Danish Kingdom—Greenland and the Faroes—to join him and the Danish foreign minister for a meeting. For the tiny Faroese department of foreign relations, it was the culmination of many years of work that such a high-profile U.S. official was willing to talk directly to the Faroese government.
But more than anything, the invitation was a sign of the growing strategic importance the Faroe Islands, as an Arctic nation, are beginning to have. Four months later, on Nov. 28, the tiny island group—which sells a quarter of its fish to Russia and was about to commit to a 5G agreement with the controversial Chinese telecom firm Huawei—signed a partnership declaration with the United States.
The Faroes consist of 18 small islands, inhabited by 52,000 people. The archipelago lies in the middle of the North Atlantic Ocean, at the center of the so-called GIUK-gap—a North Atlantic transit route between Greenland, Iceland, and the northern United Kingdom—which has regained the strategic importance it enjoyed during the Cold War.
As stated in the U.S. defense strategy for the region, which was released in a report to Congress in 2019, the gap has become a “strategic corridor for naval operations between the Arctic and the North Atlantic.” And with both Russia and China as competitors, the region is increasingly important for U.S. national security interests. With the Arctic ice melting, and the shipping traffic growing, the Faroe Islands are hoping to become a maritime service base for U.S. and NATO ships.
Like Greenland, which outgoing U.S. President Donald Trump announced he wanted to buy a year ago, the Faroe Islands are a self-governing part of the Danish Kingdom. The economy is primarily based on fishing and salmon farming.
An increasing U.S. diplomatic presence in the Faroes has been noted by local politicians and media in recent years. The U.S. ambassador to Denmark, Carla Sands, has been visiting the islands frequently. While it is normal for the politically appointed U.S. ambassadors in Denmark to visit the Faroese as part of their duties, the feeling in the Faroes is that Sands has had a more substantive agenda than her predecessors.
When the state-owned telecommunications company, Føroya Tele, was in negotiations with Huawei to make the Chinese company its 5G-provider, the ambassador addressed the issue directly in the Faroese newspaper, Sosialurin, urging the company to “choose an American or European firm” to make sure that it was the Faroese people, “not the Chinese government” that was in charge of deciding how the technology would influence Faroese values and society.
Sands has been vocal in her worries about the potential surveillance Huawei can do for the Chinese state, but in this op-ed she went further, and tried to spread fear that countries that let Huawei control their tele-infrastructure would be working by “communist rules.” If those rules were broken, for example by “supporting human rights demonstrations in Hong Kong,” the country could be subject to “threats, reprisals and economic sanctions.”
Sands told me that she found her role as ambassador to naturally include engagement in the Faroes to ensure trade and “people-to-people relations.” She also noted the importance of the islands to NATO security. Sands isn’t the only American suitor to visit the islands lately. In October, U.S. Admiral Robert Burke, Commander of U.S. Naval Forces Europe, visited and met with the Faroese foreign minister to discuss security in the Arctic and the possibility of cooperation with the Faroes providing services to U.S. navy ships.
Faroese foreign relations have always been synonymous with business relations. As foreign and security policies on the islands are still, legally speaking, under the Danish government’s control, Faroese leaders were historically somewhat limited to making trade and fishery agreements.
But when Denmark joined what later would become the European Union in 1972, the Faroese Parliament decided not to follow—mainly because it would mean giving up fishing rights. And the EU’s ever-growing importance for Danish politics has complicated the relationship between Denmark and the self-governing parts of the kingdom, which sometimes, like when it comes to fishing rights, have opposing interests. As the Faroe Islands aren’t part of the European single market, the islands have developed important business relations outside the union.
The archipelago’s government was one of the first in the West to reach a fishery agreement with the Soviet Union in the 1970s, and later discussed a free-trade agreement with Russia for years. Even though no agreement was reached, Russia remained a vital market for Faroese exports.
After the Ukraine crisis in 2014, tensions between the West and Russia reached a boiling point. At the peak of the disagreements, the United States and Europe implemented sanctions on Russian minerals, which led to Russia imposing boycotts on European food imports. The Faroe Islands had just faced European boycotts themselves following a fishery dispute with Norway and the European Union and had increased their export to the Russian market. Luckily for the Faroese economy, Russia did not include the islands in the boycotts, and in the coming years, exports to the Eastern giant increased.
In 2015, the Faroe Islands opened a diplomatic mission in Moscow, and in 2018, the Faroes signed a memorandum of cooperation with the Eurasian Economic Union, formalizing cooperation with Russia and its neighbors. In 2018, 27 percent of Faroese exports went to the Russian market—making the Faroes the largest fish exporter to the country—and Russia was the largest single importer of Faroese fish (European countries combined imported more Faroese fishery products) and therefore essential to the Faroese economy.
While Danish politicians have sometimes expressed concern over Faroese trade with Russia while Denmark and the EU are being partially boycotted, Denmark does not have the power to decide who the Faroes trade with. As the Faroe Islands have become increasingly independent over the last decades, the nature of the relationship with Denmark has changed. When it comes to trade, the Faroes deal with anyone they choose, and the Danish government knows that any interference with trade or fishing rights could lead to major conflicts within the kingdom.
Washington probably won’t be worried about Faroese fish exports to Russia, but will be aiming at gaining equally economic and cultural ties to the islands’ inhabitants. The Faroe Islands have embassies in Moscow and Beijing, and the Faroese foreign minister told me that Pompeo had asked, in the meeting with the foreign ministers of the Danish Kingdom, why the Faroes don’t have any diplomatic representation in the United States.
In recent years, China has also become a more important market for the Faroes than ever before. The Faroese salmon-farming giant, Bakkafrost, is currently facing problems in exporting salmon to China because of the COVID-19 pandemic, but the islands are exporting more than 20 times more salmon to China than in 2010. A free-trade agreement with the most populous country on earth is therefore something politicians and businessmen in the Faroes dream about. And when the Faroese telecom company was working on a 5G agreement with Huawei, the Chinese ambassador to Denmark apparently raised the issue with Faroese ministers.
The promise of an easier path to free trade was of course meant to be secret, but it was revealed as the Faroese minister of commerce was about to give an interview to Faroese media on another topic, but was approached by a state official from his ministry. The minister had forgotten to turn off his microphone, and his private conversation with the official, who told him that the Chinese ambassador had said in a meeting that it would be easier to achieve free trade between the countries if the telecom company signed an agreement with Huawei, was recorded.
The revelation made international news and put pressure on Faroese authorities not to make Huawei it’s 5G provider. It has since become clear that an agreement with Huawei, even though not officially ruled out, is unlikely.
The Faroese tightrope act is likely to continue as great powers show a greater interest in the islands. A recent Danish Institute for International Relations report, commissioned by the Danish Foreign Ministry, outlines the effects of the Arctic change from a “low-tension” toward a “high-tension” region. In addition to discussing the challenges that growing tensions between the superpowers in the Arctic will have on the region in general, it discusses the challenges the new political reality will have on the Arctic parts of the Danish Kingdom—Greenland and the Faroe Islands.
“Great power tension in the Arctic has two effects on the Faroe Islands,” Mikkel Runge Olesen, one of the authors of the report said. “The first one is that they are back on the map,” he explained, “but there is a negative side as well. The more interested the US becomes, the harder it will be to fly under the radar, trade with everyone, and not pick a side.”
After the meeting with Pompeo, the Faroese foreign minister was satisfied. He had prepared to talk about formalizing trade and cooperation between the United States and the Faroe Islands and was positively surprised by the effectiveness of the meeting; officials from both countries had already started working on the agreement that was formalized last month. Apart from stating that the parties of the agreement want to strengthen cooperation in science, culture, and business, the agreement also acknowledges “common strategic and economic interests in the North Atlantic.”
For the United States, this will perhaps be seen as a victory in establishing its presence and maybe for the immediate future ruling out Chinese influence in a place that trades with everyone. The agreement has not received a lot of attention in the Danish media, but one can imagine that Danish politicians are happy as well. While the agreement was signed by Faroese and U.S. officials, American diplomats must have informed the Danes of what was going on. And while a memorandum with the Eurasian Economic Union does not align with Danish foreign policy, Faroese partnership with the U.S. government does.
Faroese politicians are aware of the increased relevance the tiny island group is beginning to have. When I talked to the Faroese foreign minister in August, he expressed happiness over the superpower suitors.
“We have often been told that we have been insignificant in recent years after our geographical location lost importance when tensions in the region disappeared,” Rana explained. “We have had problems reaching out to other nations, and therefore the current situation is welcomed … Some nations have natural resources, but our location is a resource for us.”",,Regin Winther Poulsen,Morning Brief|Argument|Argument|Report|Report|Argument|Dispatch,,2020-12-07,Foreign Policy

The Merkel Model and Its Limits
Accurate threat assessment is vital to the formulation of foreign policy. Across centuries of political and technological change, the giants of strategy—from Sun-tzu and Thucydides to Carl von Clausewitz and George Kennan—warned against exaggerating threats and ignoring their geopolitical context. Still, ideologically driven threat inflation—from a phantom Vietnamese attack in the Gulf of Tonkin to nonexistent Iraqi nuclear and chemical weapons—has repeatedly led the United States into costly quagmires. Despite this history, the country is again on the brink of an ideologically driven blunder—this time in the Arctic.
For over a decade, defense hawks have been sounding an alarm over Russia’s supposed military superiority and incipient aggression in the region. Previous U.S. presidents resisted the bait, avoiding confrontation and embracing cooperation through the multinational Arctic Council established after the end of the Cold War. They knew that Russia’s forces in the region were defensively structured and weaker than they were before the Soviet collapse in 1991, despite efforts to rebuild them that began in the mid-2000s. Previous U.S. presidents also knew that U.S. and NATO forces had the clear upper hand in the Arctic and that predictions of Russian aggression were mainly threat-mongering by armchair analysts and vested political interests.
But the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump has recently embraced Arctic alarmism with a vengeance. It has stoked fears of Russian and Chinese “aggression,” trashed the Arctic Council’s delicate diplomacy, and adopted a new confrontational posture. In so doing, it joins the alarmists in three serious mistakes: the failure to assess specific threats accurately, the failure to consider an adversary’s forces in relation to those of the United States and its allies, and the failure to evaluate the broader strategic landscape—the political, economic, and environmental factors beyond the battlefield. Violation of these three pillars of careful threat assessment is drawing the United States toward an unnecessary confrontation in a region where the real enemy isn’t Cold War ghosts but looming environmental disaster.
A staple of the new Arctic alarmism is the “icebreaker gap”—the notion that Russia’s large fleet of icebreaking vessels poses a threat of naval aggression. Alarmists invoke the term seemingly unaware that it echoes the so-called bomber and missile gaps of the 1950s and 1960s—false claims of Soviet nuclear superiority that justified an expensive and precarious nuclear arms race. In fact, Russia’s icebreaker fleet performs overwhelmingly civilian missions. And given that Russia has ten times as much Arctic coastline as the United States and is roughly 50 times as economically dependent on the region, it would be strange indeed if Russia’s icebreaker fleet were not far larger than the U.S. fleet.
Handwringing over the icebreaker gap also suggests a lack of understanding about what these vessels actually do. Russia’s icebreakers perform the same coast guard functions as Canadian, Norwegian, and U.S. ships: search-and-rescue missions, antismuggling operations, oil-spill responses, and supply deliveries for research stations and remote coastal communities. They also escort cargo vessels across the ice-choked Northern Sea Route that links Europe and Asia. Some Russian icebreakers do seasonally escort naval vessels into or out of port through treacherous icy waters, but this reflects a weakness, not a strength. Three of the Russian navy’s fleets—the Baltic, Black Sea, and Pacific fleets—can access the high seas only via narrow “choke points” where enemies closely track them. The fourth, Russia’s Northern Fleet, faces the additional burden of enduring a brutal, months-long Arctic winter during which Russian ships can pick their way to safer seas only in the wake of a plodding icebreaker. U.S. warships face no such challenges.
The United States is on the brink of an ideologically driven blunder in the Arctic.
Nevertheless, some Arctic alarmists advocate the creation of a large and even nuclear-powered U.S. icebreaker fleet that could escort U.S. Navy warships into combat on the polar icecap. Senator Dan Sullivan, Republican of Alaska, has argued that “the highways of the Arctic are paved by icebreakers. . . . Russia has superhighways, and we have dirt roads.” Claims like this reveal ignorance of how icebreakers actually function. Churning through pack ice more than three feet thick, an icebreaker leaves a narrow path choked with jagged floes (one cubic meter of ice weighs nearly 2,000 pounds). The steel plating of a U.S. Navy destroyer is less than one-half-inch thick. Even a polar-rated cargo ship has a more ice-resistant hull. If a destroyer treats this ice-clogged channel as a superhighway, it runs the risk of a deadly collision. Moreover, ships are limited to the speed of their escorts, which plow through three to six feet of ice at under ten nautical miles per hour, even in good weather. In severe weather—fierce winds and powerful waves that encase the ship’s deck and superstructure in ice—progress slows to a crawl. The United States’ fast, stealthy, thin-hulled warships would become sitting ducks.
Some Arctic hawks tout Russia’s so-called combat icebreaker as a unique threat—a ship “built specifically for Arctic fighting.” But the recently launched Ivan Papanin hardly represents an escalation in the Arctic arms race since it was modeled on existing NATO vessels such as Norway’s Svalbard, in service since 2002. It also resembles the Danish Knud Rasmussen–class ships that have been deployed since 2008. Other similar offshore patrol vessels include Finland’s Pohjanmaa-class and Canada’s Harry DeWolf–class ships. All are roughly 300 feet long, cruise at 20 knots, can break three feet of ice, and carry multiple weapons. All are also designed for Coast Guard–type patrol and search-and-rescue missions, as well as possible armed conflict. The Ivan Papanin is Russia’s first in this category and differs mainly in that it is still not operational. Behind schedule and already outnumbered, it hardly lives up to its billing by one analyst as “Russia’s Trump Card in the Battle for the Arctic.”
If fears of an icebreaker gap stem in part from an exaggeration of Russian capabilities, they also reflect a failure to evaluate such capabilities in relation to U.S. and allied forces. The mere number of Russian ships or planes means little in isolation. What counts is how those forces stack up against their potential opponents. Throughout the Cold War, U.S. assessments not only exaggerated the total number of Soviet bombers and missiles but also often ignored the United States’ countervailing forces—which were nearly always more accurate, reliable, and technologically advanced. In today’s Arctic, alarmists highlight Russia’s assets while omitting similar scrutiny of U.S. and NATO forces. For example, alarmists note that Russia’s Arctic-based Northern Fleet is its navy’s largest. But the entire Northern Fleet still has fewer than 40 surface ships—half of which date to the Cold War. Now, subtract smaller coastal-patrol craft and what remains are barely a dozen major combatants. A host of problems from faulty turbines to obsolete air-defense systems have delayed newer Russian ships from entering service. The same problems plague Russia’s submarine fleet, which is consistently outclassed by the U.S. Navy’s modern torpedo and cruise-missile-firing attack submarines.
By contrast, the recent Trident Juncture exercise brought 65 U.S. and NATO ships to the Arctic and involved the first transit of a U.S. aircraft carrier across the Arctic Circle since 1991. In a crisis, NATO could surge far more naval power to the region, vastly outmatching the Russians. This power includes ballistic missile subs recently adapted to launch cruise missiles and deploy special forces. Despite U.S. fears of Russian submarines infiltrating Scandinavian waters, it is the United States that now has greater sub-based land-attack capabilities.
A similar mismatch exists when it comes to Arctic air power. Alarmists hype the threat posed by some dozen “airbases” that Russia has built or reopened after 20 years of abandonment. But these outposts are better described as airstrips. Manned by small crews, none of them is capable of hosting even a single squadron of fighter jets. Instead, they mainly support antiair and antiship batteries—early-warning radars and short-range missiles designed to defend approaches to Russian territory. Russian fighter jets still deploy from the same distant mainland bases that they did 30 years ago and, due to a modest in-air refueling capability, have a limited combat radius. As a result, the Russian air force offers a formidable defense against any intruder, but it is neither structured nor based for major offensive operations.
Meanwhile, the United States and NATO can summon several hundred stealth F-22 and F-35 fighters for long-range Arctic missions. Russia, for its part, still has no stealth fighters with similar ability to penetrate air defenses. Both in the air and at sea, it is the United States and its allies that possess the greater Arctic power-projection capability.
Cold War era threat inflation was driven by a belief in a relentless Kremlin strategy for world domination. The United States discounted evidence that by the 1970s, the Soviet leadership had grown deeply conservative—afraid of U.S. military and technological might, seeking not to advance but merely to shore up its tottering global positions—in favor of dire assessments of Soviet readiness to launch a major war. Today, the belief in Russian President Vladimir Putin’s unrelenting hostility fuels an exaggeration of Russia’s strength and aggressive design.
Alarmists consistently shade facts to fit this narrative: Russian bombers intercepted by NATO fighters near Alaskan or Norwegian airspace are practicing bombing runs, while U.S. bombers intercepted by Russian fighters close to Russian airspace in the Baltic or Black Seas are on “training missions.” Russian amphibious exercises in the Arctic are offensive, but similar U.S.-NATO maneuvers are defensive. Some even see a Russian attack on the Baltics or Norway—virtually inconceivable, as it would bring swift military as well as political and economic ruin—as a realistic possibility. Such exaggeration in turn fuels the cycle of buildup and counterbuildup.
A more realistic approach to assessing Russia’s Arctic policy does not ignore Russia’s recent military buildup but places it in context. That means, first of all, acknowledging that the balance of forces still strongly favors the West. This approach also recognizes 25 years of Russian cooperation in the Arctic, including Moscow’s constructive role on the Arctic Council and fealty to the principle that territorial disputes can be settled only through the UN Law of the Sea process. (The only Arctic nation that has not acceded to the Law of the Sea is the United States.) Above all, realists appreciate Russia’s emotional and economic stake as an Arctic nation and understand that bluster aimed at a domestic audience reflects not strength but insecurity.
Arctic alarmism began over a decade ago with fears of a Russian “grab” for the North Pole’s undersea riches. Today, that alarm has shifted to fears of Russia’s ability to push NATO out of the region. Russia’s coastal defenses are described in think tank analyses as “core components of an anti-access/area denial bubble” while their naval deployments pose “a direct challenge to transatlantic sea lines of communication that are essential to Allied reinforcement of Europe in the event of any major conflict.” This is Cold War–style threat inflation, as Russia’s air-defense radars and missiles simply do not approach such capability. The possibility of Russia’s tiny fleet charging into the North Atlantic to attack NATO reinforcements during a major war is suicidally, apocalyptically remote.
A more realistic concern is not that Russia will gain complete dominance but that NATO will lose it. Moscow’s modest buildup could threaten NATO’s ability to keep the Russian navy contained in its home Arctic waters and block it from transiting the Greenland-Iceland-United Kingdom Gap. NATO has historically controlled this choke point, allowing it to project power freely in those waters. Now, Russia has begun pushing back. Like China in its coastal waters—though less aggressively—Russia is essentially saying, “Your air force will not dominate our skies without challenge, nor will your carriers and cruise-missile-firing submarines approach our shores with impunity.” The real strategic choice is whether to seek an accommodation that permits some measure of mutual security or to insist on continued U.S.-NATO dominance and risk escalating Arctic confrontation.
The Arctic is enduring a catastrophic acceleration of environmental degradation.
Last spring, the Trump administration came out unequivocally for dominance. It denounced Russian aggression, mocked the Arctic Council’s diplomacy, and even berated allies such as Denmark for rejecting an offer to purchase Greenland. Trump recently announced the potential acquisition of foreign Arctic bases and additional, nuclear-powered icebreakers. His administration has also added China to the list of Arctic aggressors because Beijing’s modest research and investment projects trigger alarm over a “militarized polar silk road.” China is dependent on trade between Asia and Europe, so its interest in the Northern Sea Route and self-identification as a “near-Arctic power” are entirely reasonable—yet the latter claim caused U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to erupt in fury.
Senior U.S. Air Force and Navy officials have also begun touting strategies to project combat power into the Arctic and have even suggested reviving a Cold War policy of sending carrier strike groups into the Barents Sea: “That strategy really broke the back of Gorbachev,” U.S. Admiral James G. Foggo III said in a recent statement. “They pulled everything back to protect the homeland and the Barents. So it was effective. . . . [in] bringing the former Soviet Union to its knees.” More worrisome still was the Trump administration’s recent decision to send a naval flotilla to the Barents Sea near Russia and its plans for more “freedom of navigation operations.” These maneuvers in Russian-claimed waters are designed to demonstrate that the United States does not accept Moscow’s boundaries. As one Arctic expert warned, rather than just “poking the bear,” such aggressive operations in Russian coastal waters “would be more akin to crawling into the bear’s den and kidnapping one of her cubs.”
One very real threat that the ideologically driven Trump administration has not acknowledged is climate change. At the outset of the new millennium, a U.S. Navy study with the forward-looking title “Naval Operations in an Ice Free Arctic” included a recommendation to buy more icebreakers. This evident contradiction highlights the failure of many U.S. strategists to appreciate what an ice-free Arctic actually means or, more broadly, to comprehend how the changing environment will soon negate the assumptions upon which U.S. strategy are based. Instead of one more venue for competition with Russia, a rapidly warming Arctic will be the locus of a cascading series of environmental, economic, and public health disasters that will render both countries’ traditional political and military priorities moot.
The Arctic is enduring a catastrophic acceleration of environmental degradation. A retreating icecap opens the seas to unpredictable currents and ferocious storms, which batter the coasts while the interior is threatened by uncontrollable wildfires above and sinking tundra below. It takes little imagination, only extrapolation from what is already underway, to see how this wreaks havoc on the Arctic hawks’ plans. Unseasonal storms will threaten hundreds of lives on a stricken cruise ship. Hundreds of millions of dollars will be lost each time a tanker collides with a NATO frigate as navies raise their operational tempo in crowded Arctic seas. Billions more will disappear and incalculable environmental damage will be done with each new oil spill. Even the “ordinary” cost of repairing infrastructure atop sinking permafrost will run into the hundreds of billions of dollars. Add to that the staggering costs of replacing income from collapsed farms and fisheries and of relocating coastal communities, and the colossal expense of simply surviving Arctic climate change makes that of a simultaneous arms race inconceivable. As for armed conflict in the region, in the words of Canadian Brigadier General Mike Nixon, “It would quickly turn into the largest search and rescue operation the world has ever seen.”
Blind to looming disaster, Trump’s desire to dominate an Arctic endowed with endless U.S. oil brings to mind a crusader from the Middle Ages who, while seeking to export his faith on a journey of conquest, unwittingly imports a plague that devastates his own country. This is no casual metaphor. Scientists have long warned about the dangers of disease in a warming Arctic and traced recent anthrax outbreaks to spores from the thawing carcasses of long-frozen animals. Virologists have “awakened” dormant viruses from the permafrost, and biologists are charting the warming-fueled spread of disease in Arctic fish and mammals. The collapse of key species or the spread of disease between species, including humans, could make the Arctic the source of the next global pandemic.
In the face of all this, bromides from analysts such as Heather Conley that “the country that controls the Arctic controls the world” are extremely shortsighted. Climate-driven crises upend traditional notions of political-military control. The looming catastrophe can be managed only cooperatively. Thirty years ago, as the United States and the Soviet Union ended the Cold War and pondered how to eliminate chemical weapons, U.S. Secretary of State James Baker proposed disposing of them “somewhere in the Arctic.” Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev replied: “That would be even worse” because, in the Arctic, “the ecological balance cannot be disturbed under any circumstances.” Let the wisdom of their predecessors guide today’s leaders in halting an incipient Arctic arms race that can only hasten global catastrophe.

The new Global Xpress (GX) payloads support the rapidly growing demand among both commercial and government users for seamless, reliable, high-speed mobile broadband services in the Arctic and throughout the world.
Inmarsat’s new Arctic capabilities will further increase network flexibility and efficiency through multi-beam, high-throughput capacity that can be fully dialled up and down depending on customer demand in the region.
Today, the Arctic Circle represents a rapidly growing connectivity region for high-quality mobile broadband with increasing requirements from government, maritime and aviation customers. Building on Inmarsat’s current capabilities up to and beyond 75º North, the new GX Arctic payloads will improve network performance in very high latitudes by flying directly overhead, providing GX antennas with much higher elevation angles to optimise throughput.
Today’s announcement comes less than a month after Inmarsat’s decision to invest in three new GX satellites (GX7, 8 & 9) to be built by Airbus Defence & Space, which will deliver a transformational change in GX’s global capabilities, capacity and agility for the benefit of current and future Inmarsat customers, partners and investors.
The Arctic region satellites will be operated by Space Norway’s Arctic Satellite Broadband Mission (ABSM) team. Inmarsat is the only commercial partner to be included as part of Space Norway’s ABSM satellites, which will be built by Northrop Grumman Innovation Systems.
The new GX Arctic payloads (GX10A & 10B) will be placed into Highly Elliptical Orbits (HEO), ensuring continuous coverage above 65º North and will have the ability to direct capacity in real-time to the areas of highest demand.
They represent the world’s first and only mobile broadband payload dedicated to the Arctic region and will integrate seamlessly into the current and planned GX network. The GX payloads, scheduled to launch in 2022, will be fully compatible with current and future GX terminals, ensuring that current Global Xpress customers can benefit from the further extension of the network.
This enhancement of GX is further validation of the success of the network, first designed by Inmarsat in 2010, and now seen as the gold standard for high-speed broadband connections wherever customers need them in the world. Inmarsat’s diverse network strategy ensures the highest hot-spot capacity, optimal coverage, excellent ‘look-angles’ between the terminal and the satellite, zero blockage and deep resilience for GX customers.
Inmarsat’s GX network began global services in 2015 and it remains the world’s first and only seamless global mobile broadband network. Inmarsat has since grown GX revenues strongly and established leading positions in the emerging global Maritime, Aviation and Government mobile satellite broadband markets, with GX revenues increasing by 85% to $250.9m in 2018. GX is the most successful network for global mobility.
“I would like to thank Space Norway for providing this opportunity to deliver dedicated GX capacity in the Arctic region. Norway has been a strong, strategic partner for Inmarsat over many years. It is the home to one of our most advanced research and development centres, located at the Norwegian Maritime Competence Center (NMCC) based in Ålesund, which is part of the Norwegian University of Science and Technology campus. Today’s announcement with Space Norway is a further example of the strength of this relationship.
“Connectivity in the Arctic region is growing in importance as aircraft fly more northerly routes, merchant ships transit new high-value waterways and the region becomes of increasing geo-political importance for diverse governments. Inmarsat’s GX network will always seek to be ahead of where our customers are going and what they demand from us. This enhancement is fully backward compatible and will strengthen coverage over the Arctic to provide the connectivity needed by our customers now and into the future. As part of the existing Inmarsat GX network, customers will now have seamless, high-quality mobile broadband services as they travel in and out of the Arctic region.
“I am delighted to say that Inmarsat will be the only provider of the mobile broadband connectivity our customers need in the Arctic region.”
“In close collaboration with Inmarsat and government partners we are about to get in place a strategically important capacity for all those currently operating in the Arctic without access to broadband capabilities. Our focus is on the users – fishermen, researchers, rescue personnel, coast guard, military and others. We are proud to join forces with Inmarsat and we are confident that this collaboration will be welcomed by those operating in the High North”.
Inmarsat’s current GX fleet is comprised of four operating satellites (GX1-4) and is planned to be augmented to seven satellites by mid-2021 with the launch of a further three GX payloads (GX5 and GX6A & B) which are currently under construction and scheduled for launch in 2019, 2020 and 2021 respectively. Inmarsat recently announced the addition of a further three GX satellites (GX7, 8 & 9) to the global GX constellation. With the two Arctic satellites announced today (GX10A, GX10B), Inmarsat’s aggregate constellation will therefore be comprised of twelve payloads.
Inmarsat is the world leader in global, mobile satellite communications. It owns and operates the world’s most diverse global portfolio of mobile telecommunications satellite networks, and holds a multi-layered, global spectrum portfolio, covering L-band, Ka-band and S-band, enabling unparalleled breadth and diversity in the solutions it provides.

Not just because it’s home to the iconic polar bear, and four million people, but also because it helps keep our world’s climate in balance.
Arctic sea ice acts as a huge white reflector at the top of the planet, bouncing some of the sun’s rays back into space, helping keep the Earth at an even temperature.
But man-made climate change means the Arctic has warmed over the past few decades – actually about twice as much as the global average.
As the sea ice melts there’s less to reflect the rays, and more heat is absorbed by the ocean, magnifying the warming effect.
The Arctic also helps circulate the world's ocean currents, moving cold and warm water around the globe.

Abstract—This article surveys the unsatisfying
communication capabilities in the harsh Arctic regions. By
melting of the ice caps, the undergoing change of the north polar
area opens new opportunities and, therefore, increases the need
for human and machine-to-machine communications. The
emerging demands and challenges are reviewed. New satellite
systems, architectures, and technologies being deemed as key
enablers are highlighted. As also addressed in this article,
satellite links could additionally backhaul terrestrial networks
for local communications.

I. INTRODUCTION
Most commonly, scientists define the Arctic as the region
above the Arctic circle, an imaginary line that circles the globe
at 66° 32"" N. The Arctic is currently experiencing a warmer
climate, which is slowly reducing the permanent floating ice
cover and making the area more accessible to shipping and
other activities. Currently, fishing fleets, cruise ships, and
cargo ships are operating already above 80°N, and oil/gas
explorations are extending above 75°N. Therefore, the number
of stakeholders in these areas will further increase.
Communication infrastructure and associated equipment
face a very harsh environment in the Arctic. Because of this
rough environment, communication is an essential part for
safety of life. However, availability of communication is very
limited. The vast geographic areas of the sea and ice do not
allow a dense terrestrial communication infrastructure.
Geostationary (GEO) satellites can theoretically provide
coverage up to 81°N, but the practical limit is typically
assumed to be around 76°N. However, polar-orbiting satellites
could serve the whole Arctic by using a low earth orbit (LEO)
or high elliptical orbit (HEO), e.g., the “Molniya” orbit.
In this article, the current situation and the existing
communication possibilities for the Arctic are reviewed. A
detailed outline of the communication challenges in Norwegian
waters and territories can be found in [1]. A glance at potential
high frequency (HF) terrestrial communication in the polar
region is also given in [2].
The initial part of this article is addressing the change of
this unique region regarding climate and its resulting potentials.
The existing and future user needs in communications will be
reflected. The main focus of this survey is the requirements for
any kind of communication as well as the details on satellite
communications. Finally, new architectures and technologies
for satellite communications in the Arctic are discussed.

II. CHANGES OF THE ARCTIC ENVIRONMENT
During the last decades, the Arctic Ocean has experienced a
drastic change in the extension of its floating ice coverage. As
shown in Fig. 1, the size of the ice cap has decreased
significantly; this trend is being predicted to continue by
several scientists. Increased shipping activities are experienced
during the last years in the Arctic Ocean, where new routes are
also feasible. Mainly, the Northern Sea Route (NSR) along the
Russian Arctic Coast is of high interest and already in use by
40-50 transits per year. Scheduled to start in 2017, the north-
east of the Yamal Peninsula, Russia at Sabetta, a new liquefied
natural gas plant (Yamal LNG) will operate, including 16 new
built ice-class tankers. Nevertheless, the melting of the ice cap
does not mean a permanent ice-free Arctic Ocean. Even
according to the most extreme prognosis for 2050, the North
Pole will only be so-called ""ice-free"", that is, less than 10% of
the water surface is ice covered, during a few months per year.
Ships will still be slowed down by icebergs and drifting ice.
The current average speed in the NSR is 7–13 knots [3]
compared with 21–25 knots in open waters. Furthermore,
sailing in these waters require a different class of ships
compared with open waters. Moreover, all routes have political
difficulties as the respective countries claim parts of them as
territorial waters and not as international straits. Anyhow, the
reduced ice cap has already allowed shipping in the NSR
during the last years by support of ice breakers, not only in case
of emergency caused by lack of communication capabilities but
also because of areas with still permanent ice coverage (e.g., in
the Laptev Sea).

However, the overall benefit of the possible shipping routes
is questionable: the North-West Passage, the Transpolar Sea
Route, and the NSR, see also Fig. 1. There are no large
distance savings using these routes between major international
ports compared with voyages via the Panama Canal or Suez
and Malacca. Only the NSR could save approximately 20%
shipping distance between the largest European harbors
(Rotterdam, The Netherlands, and Hamburg, Germany) and the
largest harbors in China (e.g., Shanghai, Ningbo-Zhoushan,
Hong Kong), see Table I. The route between New York and
Singapore is even shorter via Suez, and this also applies to
routes between Asia and North America, except a few routes
from the East Coast to China. Another shorter route via the
NSR is between Europe and the North American West Coast
[4]. Currently, shipowners are even ordering reduced speed of
ships to save fuel costs instead of speeding up the transport. On
Arctic routes, there are higher safety requirements: the need for
new ship classes, higher risks, and many other uncertainties
that are not in favor of shipowners gaining on shorter distances
and transport time. Also, the global impact on the environment
by shipping through the polar regions is not to be neglected [5].
On the other hand, the warmer climate in the Arctic offers
new access to raw materials, gas, and oil, mainly in the
Russian, Norwegian, and Canadian regions. Consequently, the
largest increase of human activity and communication needs
will be toward this local destination traffic instead of transit.
Many new ice-strengthened bulk ships are expected to navigate
through these waters, for example, Yamal LNG. Also, sea
tourism by cruise liners will enter the Arctic region. Finally,
these new opportunities in combination with the harsh Arctic
environment evolve risks for coastguards toward the
responsibility of performing patrol, surveillance, and
emergency response tasks. Again, new communication
solutions are needed.
III. NEEDS OF CURRENT AND POTENTIAL USERS
Current fishing activities are even more up north than
decades before. The same evolves in new areas of eco-tourism
and leisure sailing. Additionally, the areas for drilling are
explored in the High North, and research activities are
permanently running. Finally, cargo shipping as transit or local
traffic exists. Since the usage of satellites for collecting ship
data via the automatic identification system (AIS), these new
developments could be monitored [6].
Independent of the climate change and its consequences,
the polar region experiences continuous air traffic since the mid
of last century. The number of flights simultaneously present in
the Arctic airspace (latitudes above 70°N) during peak period
conditions are predicted to steadily increase from 55 at present
to more than 160 in 2030 [7]. Not only airliners and cargo
flights are taken into account but also general aviation,
helicopter flights, nonscheduled flights (e.g., search and rescue
(SAR), ambulance, etc.), and military flights.
Many different groups have diverse communication
requirements. Offshore oil and gas exploitations, including
safeguarding of operations, installations, transportation, and
associated ports are looking toward high data rates until the
platforms are operational and linked via fiber cables to the
main land. Also, crew welfare is a rising issue toward an
attractive employment, not only on ships but also on
explorations and for people living in these remote areas.
Permanent monitoring of fish farms, aquaculture installations,
and their associate activities request continuous flow of
information, for example, machine-to-machine (M2M)
communications for ""health"" monitoring of the systems. Within
the maritime area, traffic and environmental safety monitoring
is needed, including the distribution of navigational data, for
example, navigational warnings, maritime safety information,
and position reporting. Another source of information would be
weather and ice information to be distributed over a vast
geographic area toward the mariners, fishers, and others.
Moreover, authorities (coast guards and homeland security)
need reliable and robust communication solutions for defense
operations, territorial control, law enforcement of illegal
activities, and environmental crime. Also, a robust
communication infrastructure is required for aircraft in the
polar region [7]. Finally, research activities such as ice studies
and meteorological and hydrological research require
communication systems for monitoring and controlling. In
Table II, the demands on data throughput for different
applications in the maritime [8] and aeronautical domain are
illustrated.
IV. EXISTING AND PLANNED COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS
Broadband communication is currently unavailable in the
Arctic. The GEO Inmarsat satellite and very small aperture
terminal (VSAT) satellites provide a theoretical coverage up to
81°N. Although the practical limit is assumed to be around
76°N. Attempts to optimize signal reception of the Ka-Sat by
Eutelsat at the shelf of the Arctic Ocean in North-Western
regions of Russia prove the practical difficulties of GEO
satellites for polar areas [9]. Because of an inclination of 52° of
the LEO orbits by the Globalstar satellite system, the Arctic is
not fully covered. Also, the second generation of Globalstar
satellites is using the same orbits. The only notable LEO
satellite communications system constellation covering the
Arctic is Iridium, comprising 66 satellites in six polar LEO
planes at altitudes of approximately 780 km, providing a
maximum voice and data service of 130 kbit/s. Nevertheless,
because of the multi-hop architecture for reaching one of the
four Earth stations via feeder links, high latencies exist in the
system up to 500 ms for voice and 20 s for data [10].
Furthermore, the non-commercial US tactical satellite
communications system MUOS (Mobile User Objective
System) covers in a geosynchronous earth orbit the Arctic by
up to 384 kbit/s.
Based on a Russian Federal Space Agency program of the
early 1990s, the Gonets system has been commercially
operational since 2000, using a LEO orbit altitude of 1400 km
with an inclination of 82.5°. In total, 5 satellites are in orbit
today. The two Gonets-D-1 support a data rate of 2.7 kbit/s,
and the three Gonets-D1M satellites, up to 64 kbit/s.
A distress alert detection satellite system for SAR is
provided by the Cospas-Sarsat program. Six LEO satellites are
operational for collecting distress signals at 406 MHz in an
orbit at an altitude of approximately 850 km and with emphasis
on the polar regions. Since May 2011, SAR responsibilities in
the Arctic are governed by the Arctic Search and Rescue
Agreement [11].
Terrestrial systems also exist in the Arctic, although very
limited in coverage. The current voice communications for
maritime applications (ship-to-ship or ship-to-shore) is based
on analog technologies in the very high frequency (VHF) band,
mainly Channel 16 at 156.8 MHz but also Channels 6 and 13
with a range of up to 60 nautical miles (NM). Other
communication systems are operating in the medium-frequency
(MF) and high-frequency (HF) band with analog and a few
evolving narrowband digital services, such as digital selective
calling (DSC), Navigational Telex (Navtex), Maritime Safety
Information (MSI), Narrowband Direct Printing (NBDP), and
other HF digital data services. However, the dependence on
signal reflection from the ionosphere is rendering MF/HF
communications unreliable, although the coverage distances
may be very large during favorable ionospheric conditions. A
future MF/HF digital data service for MSI would include
Navigational Data (NAVDAT). The NAVDAT operates in the
500-kHz band (MF) for digital broadcasting of maritime safety
and security-related information from shore to ship with 10-
kHz bandwidth using OFDM modulation, providing a data rate
of about 15 to 25 kbit/s. The coverage is approximately
250/350 NM from the coast station [12]. An overview of the
coverage limitations of communication systems in the Arctic
are given in Table III.
Maritime communications will experience major changes
during the next two decades. The present maritime
communication systems, not only for the Arctic, cannot serve
the upcoming needs [13]. Several initiatives are currently
ongoing within the different organizations, such as the “e-
Navigation Strategy” of the International Maritime
Organization (IMO) and the IALA Maritime Radio
Communication Plan [12], with the ultimate overall goal of
modernizing statutory maritime communication systems with
an increased reliance on robust communications, including
satellite communications. This will also impact the
communications in the Arctic.
In addition, only HF communications exists over the whole
Arctic for aeronautical communications. Approximately at
least once an hour, the pilots report their position, altitude, and
speed. Limited emergency landing sites, cold fuel conditions,
and the clustering of the air traffic control regions increase the
need of robust and reliable communications.
A. Potential Satellite Orbits
Satellite orbits currently utilized for satellite
communication (SatCom) and satellite navigation (SatNav) are
portrayed in Fig. 2, along with their major orbital
characteristics [1].
Fig. 2. Satellite orbits and major orbital characteristics.
SatCom systems utilizing polar LEO orbits serve the polar
regions on a regular basis (e.g., approximately every 100 min).
However, communication between a LEO and a ground station
is yet to be granted for the Arctic. Therefore, multiple inter-
satellite hops are needed to communicate with a ground station
[10]. In contrast to GEO and LEO satellite orbits, there are
polar-oriented orbits capable of supporting broadband
communications, notably HEOs. For spotlighting the Arctic,
the apogee needs to be in the zenith for the pertinent area.
During approach and descend from the apogee, there is a long
period of visibility (up to 16 hours) until the satellite turn
toward the perigee. Two HEO orbits have been in use by the
Russians since the mid-1960s and are still in use today: The
Molniya orbit (~500 km perigee, ~40,000 km apogee altitude,
12 hours of orbital period, and about 10 hours of Arctic sight)
and the Tundra orbit (~24,000 km perigee, ~48,000 km apogee
altitude, 24 hours of orbital period, and about 16 hours of
Arctic sight). Furthermore, HEOs provide a quasi-stationary
perspective. Apogee height is approximately the GEO height,
and thus, GEO technologies can be reused (slightly modified),
resulting in cost savings and risk reduction.
B. Upcoming and Planned Polar Satellite Systems
Within 2015, the second generation of Iridium satellites,
Iridium NEXT, are planned to be launched. Data rates of up to
1.5 Mbit/s in L-band will be provided by 70 LEO satellites in
total (66 in simultaneous operation) covering the whole globe.
In 2017, the Iridium NEXT system should allegedly be fully
operational, also in the Arctic.
The Canadian Space Agency (CSA) had planned launching
two satellites operating in HEO orbits with apogee of 39,500
km and perigee of 600 km in 2016. This could have provided a
24/7 broadband communication services and enabled
monitoring of the arctic weather. However, having
unsuccessful straining to realize this Polar Communication and
Weather mission (PCW) since 2008, the Canadians have
obviously decided to reorganize the project. The Canadian
Government is now reaching out to other countries and
companies for partnership on a massive satellite program to
provide “high-capacity, continuous communication services”
and improved meteorological data in the Arctic [14]. At the
same time, Canada's Department of National Defence plans its
own satellite program for northern surveillance with the
“Radarsat Constellation Mission” [15], planning a three-
satellite launch in 2018 to help with maritime surveillance (ice,
wind, oil pollution, and ship monitoring), disaster management,
and ecosystem monitoring. The system offers up to four
passages per day in Canada's far north and several passages per
day over the Northwest Passage.
The CSA planned the launching of the Maritime
Monitoring and Messaging Micro-Satellite (M3MSat) already
in 2014. The M3MSat will have a sun-synchronous polar orbit
with the main goal of collecting automatic identification
system (AIS) signals for maritime surveillance in the Canadian
Arctic waters. Additionally, it carries a low data rate system for
two-way communication with measurement buoys or other
surveying stations.
Providing a variety of remote-sensing tasks, for example,
monitoring of environmental conditions, and also enabling
reliable communications and navigation in an economically
crucial region for Russia, the Russian Federal Space Agency is
planning the Arktika network. The initial concept of the
Arktika project was presented already in 2007, primarily as an
earth observation system consisting of four satellites in
Molniya orbits, with the main focus on meteorological
applications. Since then, the system seems to have gone
through several transformations. Most notably, a
communication component has been added, where two
communication satellites are intended to support broadcasting
services, backhaul communications, and mobile satellite
services [16]. Currently, this network is allegedly planned for
satellites capable of meteorology and emergency
communications (Arktika-M), mobile communications
(Arktika-MS1), air traffic, navigation signal relay (Arktika-
MS2), and radar remote sensing (Arktika-R). This highly
ambitious project comprises 10 satellites in total—8 in HEO
and 2 in a sun-synchronous polar orbit. Launching of the first
satellites have been planned for 2015, whereas launching of
those expected to support communications seems to have been
postponed until the final part of the mission; it is unknown how
committed the Russian space sector is to the project, and the
ability of the Arktika system to meet the user requirements in
terms of services and capacity is uncertain.
Since 1978, the ARGOS instruments (location and data
collection equipment) have been operational on several
satellites (currently seven) in polar orbits at an altitude of 850
km. The initiator French Space Agency, Centre National
d’Etudes Spatiales (CNES) decided to prepare the launch of the
fourth-generation (ARGOS-4) instruments including some
communication capabilities scheduled to fly in 2016.
Because 80% of the Arctic traffic is in Norwegian waters
[6], the Norwegian Space Center and Telenor are running the
ASK (“Arktisk Satellitt Kommunikasjon”) Project, first,
evaluating the requirements and needs for two HEO satellites
providing continuous broadband in their waters. Phase 1 of the
ASK projects was completed late 2013, and Phase 2 has
recently been initiated [17]. Telenor has declared that, under
current plans, it is contemplating to launch the satellites within
six years, that is, around 2020.
Table 4 summarizes the existing and planned satellite
systems intended to serve the Arctic with communication
capabilities. HEO coverage of the Arctic is hardly foreseen to
be realized before 2020 – 2025, if ever being accomplished for
this purpose.
V. ARCTIC COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS' CHALLENGES
A. GNSS augmentation systems (SBAS/GBAS)
Precise satellite navigation positioning relies on correction
signals obtained from fixed stations at known positions (so-
called differential satellite navigation). Augmentation of global
navigation satellite system (GNSS) is a method of improving
the system’s attributes, such as accuracy, reliability, and
availability, through the integration of external information
from such reference stations into the receiver’s calculation
process. Because of the vast open sea areas in the Arctic,
adequate ground-based augmentation systems (GBAS) are
hardly realizable. Satellite-based augmentation systems
(SBAS) utilizing GEO satellites suffer from their coverage
shortcoming in the Arctic, for example, the devised European
Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS) system
for future Galileo applications. Consequently, novel
SBAS/GBAS solutions need careful attention to accommodate
user requirements on accurate and reliable GNSS positioning in
the High North [1].
B. Weather and Icing
The harsh, unpredictable, and rapidly changing weather
conditions in the Arctic frequently cause icing on outdoor
equipment, both so-called atmospheric icing due to
precipitation and icing created by sea spray (salty ice).
Antennas enable any radio system contact with the outside
world and, thus, represent the most crucial elements regarding
system performance. Icing is one of the most serious problems
for numerous antenna installations. Ice buildup not only
increases antenna wind load and weight but also often
deteriorates the antenna’s performance to a point where it is no
longer usable for any radio system.
It is often experienced in maritime environments by ice first
forming on an antenna that it is usually wet and conductive,
particularly if it is the result of saltwater spray. This is the most
destructive condition for electrically detuning and deterioration
of antenna performance. Subsequently, ice buildup increases
and will eventually freeze solid, causing the antenna wind load
to escalate to a level where it may be stressed to its breaking
point.
Both the ice buildup and (subsequent) melting occur most
frequently in an asymmetrical fashion, so one side of the
antenna may be more affected than the other. Antennas can
also be damaged by flying ice from nearby structures often
found on ships and offshore installations. This can often cause
catastrophic failures because heavy and large ice sheets often
break loose with wind or melting. Consequently, novel robust
antenna designs are required for reliable operations of radio
systems under adverse weather conditions in the Arctic [1].
C. Vessel Movements
Stabilized antennas must lock into the intended satellite for
proper operation, but several conditions, including the vessel’s
unpredictable gyrations, can instigate a stabilized antenna to
drift away from the intended satellite and cause signal blackout
and/or harmful interference to adjacent satellites. Because of
rather severe roll, pitch, and yaw movements of a vessel during
adverse weather conditions, larger nominal elevation angles
than 5° are required, and thus, practical problems with less
advanced satellite communication terminals may be expected
to arise.
VI. NEW ARCHITECTURES AND TECHNOLOGIES FOR ARCTIC
As outlined above, the state-of-the art in Arctic
communications demand obviously new architectures and
technologies to fulfill user requirements. This section addresses
several topics that need be emphasized in paving the road
toward novel innovative solutions and further associated
research. The major goal should be to close today’s existing
communication gap until adequate broadband coverage is
obtained by utilizing new satellite systems and other space-
based assets in combination with advanced terrestrial systems.
A. Hybrid Architecture
The lack of land infrastructure in the Arctic is a limiting
factor for fast emerging new communication systems.
Therefore, a multitier approach using satellites, unmanned
aerial systems (UASs), and extended coverage by terrestrial
infrastructure could become a solution for the Arctic
environment. Fig. 3 shows a possible architecture of such an
approach. The high altitude platforms (HAPs) and/or UAVs
could serve as relay stations between the satellite platform
(GEO, LEO, MEO or HEO, whichever being the most
appropriate) and the user terminals or terrestrial base stations
embraced by the 'grey cone' [1]. Further, this infrastructure
could vary between a standalone HAP system and an integrated
terrestrial HAP satellite system. To achieve a large coverage
area of about 400–500 km footprint diameter, and
simultaneously remain in relatively calm tropospheric wind
conditions, the HAPs/UASs should preferably fly at a height of
about 20 km. Larger areas could be covered by several cross-
linked HAPs/UAVs. Hence, they could also be visible from a
GEO satellite due south up to approximately 85.8°N, which
could provide a reliable data link with a GEO satellite up to
approximately 83°N. From 83°N latitude, the longitudinal
distance to the North Pole is only about 800 km, which is the
same distance from 83°N down to 76°N, where communication
between vessels and GEO satellites is normally of acceptable
quality-of-service (QoS).
Fig. 3. Heterogeneous satellite HAPs/UASs-terrestrial Systems.
HAP/UAV payloads could comprise radio-relaying
equipment for all applicable kinds of communication services
in the appropriate satellite frequency bands. However, to
simplify the onboard equipment for a majority of the vessels,
and because of the detriment of bandwidth, the use of VHF is
recommended as a part of the frequency allotment scheme.
Anyhow, as a network topology subset of any satellite
solution, hybrid space-borne/terrestrial (HST) configurations
should be developed, particularly for minor communities and
in coastal areas, as well as on vessels and offshore installations;
being a consequential means to any of the above referenced
solutions in providing for a more convenient end-to-end
connectivity over the corresponding heterogeneous link.
Additionally, carefully devised HST solutions might also be
utilized to extend the coverage of the lower Arctic region from
GEO satellites, if larger and more powerful land station
antenna constellations are deemed economically viable.
The major advantages of such heterogeneous systems are
that they might be made ad hoc–adaptively tailored to their
mission–and deployed much faster and with less efforts and
costs than a HEO satellite system, offering among others the
following benefits: Easy to deploy; incremental deployments;
Flexibility and reconfigurability; Low operational costs
(compared to satellites); High elevation; Wide area coverage;
Broadcast/Multicast; Mobility.
The frequently mentioned challenges are suggested to be:
Regulations; Sense and avoid systems; ATM (Air Traffic

Reliable communications links are crucial for search and
rescues (SAR) activities. In the Arctic, remotely piloted aircraft
systems (RPAS) would be of significant benefit for a fast and
large-area SAR. Nevertheless, using any kind of aerial vehicle
is regulated by the International Civil Aviation Organization
(ICAO), the domestic aviation administrations, and also
particularly dedicated regulations for UAV applications.
Because of the geographical sectorial interests toward the
North Pole, domestic regulations merge in these areas, and
flying or operating aerial vehicles there might be practically
unmanageable. Furthermore, neither the ICAO regions nor the
Arctic SAR boundaries fit the regions regulated by the
International Maritime Organization (IMO) in the Arctic.
B. VHF Data Exchange System (VDES)
New potential digital VHF satellite services are envisioned.
Driven by the modernization of the global maritime distress
safety system (GMDSS) and IMO's maritime e-Navigation
strategy, request for new spectrum allocations in the VHF band
for satellite usage will be discussed at the upcoming world
radio conference (WRC) in 2015 under Agenda 1.16 in
accordance with Resolution 360 of WRC 12. The initial
approaches are looking at a system with possible data rates of
about 300 kbit/s, the main goal being to protect the already
defined satellite AIS bands. In this way the AIS system can be
offloaded from all the additional services exploiting its
payload. Furthermore, broadcasting services for the satellite-to-
ship links are envisioned and can be particularly important for
safety related information.
C. Usage of Existing Scheduled Aircraft
The collection of measurement data, AIS signals, or other
M2M telemetry information could also be done by airliners.
These scheduled aircraft fully cover the Arctic because of their
polar routes with at least 5–10 contacts per day [18]. However,
they would have to be fitted with appropriate radio receiver(s)
and signal storage devices. After landing or after reentering
satellite or terrestrial communications infrastructure, the data
could be fed into the pertinent data base.
VII. SUMMARY
Better accessibility to the Arctic because of its reduced
floating ice coverage during the last decades, has increased
communication demands from all stakeholders in this area
(fishery, exploration, leisure, expedition, cargo shipping, air
traffic, etc.). In this article, the state-of-the art communication
in the Polar Regions is surveyed.
The immediate needs for new systems because of lack of
communications infrastructure, correction signals for GNSS
augmentation systems, harsh weather conditions, and vessel
motions are emphasized.
For reaching the goal of adequate broadband coverage
before new satellite systems might, if ever, be realized for that
purpose, novel innovative solutions and further associated
research should be focused by investigating hybrid
architectures. Using hybrid space-borne/terrestrial (HST)
configurations could allow a much faster and less costly
deployment than a HEO satellite system to meet the Arctic
users' requirements. Furthermore, such HST architecture could
be adaptively tailored to its mission and could be made ad hoc.
Additionally, scheduled aircraft could support communication
in the Arctic and new digital VHF services could enable further
communications capabilities.
The Arctic is still a niche market for communication
compared to other regions in the world. Nevertheless, access to
large resources of energy (oil and gas), fish, and raw materials
is expected, and this requires communications to support
demanding maritime operations, surveillance, and emergency
response tasks satisfactorily. In the end, we are always bound
to safeguard the impact on this fragile ecosystem by the
steadily increasing activities in the area.

As it turns out, Greenland isn't for sale, and Trump was widely ridiculed for his diplomatic blundering. Yet, many wondered what could be behind this unprecedented move —and if it might have something to do with the United State's growing interest in owning a slice of the Arctic.
The U.S. is one of eight nations surrounding the Arctic — along with Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia and Sweden — that are all currently jostling for ownership of the region's frozen seas. Several of the countries have already submitted formal papers to a United Nations body, claiming portions of the vast Arctic seabed. Climate change is also opening up the Arctic's formerly ice-locked waters, making the region more accessible than ever before. ""Based on current trends, the predictions of the Arctic being completely ice-free are [that it will happen] around 2040 or 2050,"" said Richard Powell, a polar geographer at the Scott Polar Research Institute at the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom.
This surge of interest in the region has been dubbed the ""scramble for the Arctic,"" or more sensationally, ""the new Cold War,"" because Russia and the United States are big players. But despite the opportunities the region presents, can the Arctic Ocean really be owned by anybody? And why do so many countries want a stake in this landscape of drifting icebergs and polar bears?
Related: Why Is There So Much Oil in the Arctic?
There's a straightforward answer to the second question: The Arctic possesses massive oil and gas reserves. The seabed beneath the Arctic Ocean houses an estimated 90 billion barrels of oil — about 13% of the world's undiscovered oil reserves — and an estimated 30% of the planet's untapped natural gas, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
A century ago, this immense mineral wealth would have been unreachable, because we lacked the technology to exploit it. Back then, countries were limited to exploring only a thin sliver of sea along their coasts, while areas of remote ocean, like the deep Arctic, were designated as high seas that belonged to no country. But with huge technological advancements in recent decades, remote stretches of ocean have become increasingly accessible. That's forced international lawmakers to play catch-up and expand the definitions of where countries can legally explore.
Currently, under a treaty called the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), signatory countries can exploit resources from the seabed out to 370 kilometres off their shorelines. But if a country can provide evidence that particular geological features on the seabed located farther out from that 200-mile limit are connected to the nation's continental landmass, then the country's jurisdiction can be expanded deeper into the sea.
""[Countries] compile the data, make the claim, then the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf [a U.N.-appointed body] rule as to whether they accept the reasoning or not,"" Powell told Live Science.
In the Arctic, this approach puts large swathes of once-untouchable ocean up for grabs by the surrounding nations, known as the ""Arctic 8."" Many of their claims now focus on the Lomonosov Ridge, a huge, deep-sea geological feature that stretches across the Arctic Ocean. Several nations posit that this ridge is an extension of their continental shelf, a claim that could grant them access to larger areas of Arctic seabed, and thus, vast mineral wealth.
The long game
All this points to a future in which different nations will indeed own chunks of the Arctic Ocean, each with varying degrees of power. Russia and Canada, for instance, are staking the two largest claims, which would inevitably give these nations more regional influence.
However, the divvying up of the Arctic isn't likely to happen very soon. For one thing, gathering evidence about the seafloor, crafting detailed reports and wading through the intricate science of nations' claims is an intensive procedure that's only just begun.
""The process of deciding on those claims itself is going to take possibly decades. Some people predict a couple of decades, but certainly years,"" Powell said. Even if countries get the go-ahead, they'll then have to shoulder the huge expense of getting their ships to the Arctic, building deep-sea infrastructure, and extracting oil and gas from miles beneath the surface.
""It's not just about melting ice. It's still an isolated environment. There are still difficult seas and icebergs, and it's very difficult to get insurance to operate,"" Powell said. ""There's a whole set of other issues that are involved in whether that's practical.""
Related: 10 Things You Need to Know about Arctic Sea Ice
At this stage, therefore, countries' claims to the Arctic are mostly anticipatory, said Amy Lauren Lovecraft, a professor of political science at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, and director of the Center for Arctic Policy Studies. ""A lot of what's being divvied up doesn't have anything to do with immediate need. It's about 'let's get what we can under UNCLOS so that we have access to all of that space in the future,'"" she said.
Still, should we be worrying now about what ownership will ultimately do to the Arctic, even if that reality is still decades away? Could nations' jockeying for oil access spark a war? And how will an influx of resource-hungry countries affect the region's fragile ecology?
Unchecked exploitation?
Powell said the effects on the Arctic will be determined by the general global situation when nations finally move in. ""One could imagine a world where there's more conflict and anxiety about different things, and in that scenario, it would be bad news for the Arctic. But then you can also imagine increasing global organization to combat climate change,"" which might prompt states to work together to forge better environmental regulation, Powell said. ""I definitely think it depends on other, wider issues.""
Lovecraft said she is more cautiously optimistic. ""If I put on my absolute environmentalist's hat, it's true, the Arctic will be used more."" However, she added, ""I don't think it's a race to the bottom."" In other words, the Arctic will be owned and explored — but that doesn't necessarily mean it will be destroyed.
The reason is that too much hangs in the balance. For instance, the Arctic's frigid waters,already threatened by climate change, support food chains that benefit the entire planet. Lovecraft said that governments grasp the crucial importance of protecting that resource.
There's proof in the Arctic Council, established in the 1990s by the eight Arctic nations. It promotes cooperation among different countries and indigenous communities of the region, ""in particular on issues of sustainable development and environmental protection in the Arctic,"" the council website says.
Lovecraft said that countries have a desire to safeguard political and environmental stability in the region; they’re not blindly hurtling towards disaster. ""People tend to think only about the Arctic in environmental terms, or in these old, Cold War terms. But it's far more nuanced, and there's a lot of goodwill,"" she said.
This cooperation might also become increasingly crucial as other, non-Arctic nations, like China, grow interested in the region. ""They're never going to be an Arctic country, but they have money. They will use that soft power to create joint ventures [with Arctic nations] and all other kinds of ways to be in the Arctic,"" Lovecraft said. A major question then becomes whether the Arctic 8 will band together to protect the region from exploitation, Lovecraft said.
She added that a fixation with the national ""scramble for the Arctic""' could be distracting people from a larger and more immediate threat to the region: climate change. Ownership will change the face of the Arctic, but climate change is shaping the landscape irrevocably, right now.
""We're not going to have a war anytime soon in the Arctic. What we are going to have is a fundamental disruption in the ecosystem,"" Lovecraft said. ""What can [the eight Arctic countries] do to better steward this resource? Why not put more energy into protecting that future, for the common good of mankind?""

In late April, the Seventh Session of the Intergovernmental Panel for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) met in Paris, France. The goal for the 132 member governments and contributing institutions was to summarise the magnitude of ecological destruction on the planet and map the way forward. Their Global Assessment of Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services found that only four of 20 Aichi Biodiversity Targets will be met. Biodiversity declines will undermine 80% of the Sustainable Development Goals, including those related to poverty, world hunger, and public health. Declines in biodiversity and ecosystem services are projected continue through 2050 and beyond in almost every future the experts modelled. The only scenario that avoided this future was one that includes transformative change to how our societies and economies operate.
This report is the first to discuss global biodiversity loss in the context of sustainable development. It found that an estimated one million species face extinction, and that land organisms have declined in numbers by an average of 20% since 1900. (The 2018 Living Planet Report found that this value is much higher for vertebrates, which are estimated to have declined by 60% since 1970.) The main driver of these declines is the modification of natural habitats for human uses like agriculture, mining, and other industrial purposes. Over-harvesting and climate change are also major drivers globally.
In the Arctic, it comes as no surprise that climate change is the biggest driver of biodiversity loss. One of the most heart-wrenching scenes in the recent Netflix documentary series Our Planet featured walruses toppling to their deaths from the cliffs they climbed because there wasn’t enough ice left to rest on. The struggles of charismatic megafauna pull at our heartstrings but only offer a glimpse into the ecological structure of Arctic environments. For example, the disappearing ice also negatively impacts many bird species, and these changes to the Arctic ecosystem are predicted to have serious consequences for the people living there, such as decreasing food stocks and the arrival of new diseases.
The report makes it clear that biodiversity conservation (and, ideally, restoration) is no longer an ambition driven by morality but one that is essential to ensure basic human rights for people across the planet. Our patterns of consumption are undeniably driving biodiversity loss. Our economic models for assessing how ‘well’ a country is doing rely on growth every year on a planet that is finite in its resources. We need to reassess our values, livelihoods, and economies to figure out which parts of these models are worth keeping and which are pushing us towards the tipping point.
Environmental change in the report is measured using baselines that are only a few decades old, but most of the natural destruction in North America and Europe took place well before these dates. To be sure, even in their historically more pristine condition, these regions held nowhere near the amount of biodiversity that exists in the Amazon or Indonesia. However, states in these areas have the resources to risk testing sustainable development pathways and, critically, are far from achieving environmental justice even within their own borders. Transformative change is daunting, but this report is not the first call to action for us to rethink how we live our lives. Instead, it compliments other reports by experts in climate change and human rights that highlight the unjust ways our societies are structured. Much of the responsibility lies with Western countries, which account for most of the world’s consumption and per capita carbon emissions.
Saving our planet requires more than buying a reusable straw and bringing your own bags to the supermarket (although, of course every little bit helps). It requires voting for politicians at local and national levels who recognize the real threats of climate change and biodiversity loss. It requires coordinated efforts at all scales from local environmental groups planting trees and picking up litter to intergovernmental bodies like IPBES communicating with one another.
It especially requires lifting up and amplifying the voices of underrepresented groups, particularly Indigenous peoples, whose expertise has been ignored on the global stage for far too long. Despite reports of some delegates at IPBES complaining that discussions of “gender mainstreaming” and Indigenous rights were ‘political’ rather than useful for tackling biodiversity loss, conservation actors need to learn from their scarred history of failure directly related to overlooking the needs and values of local groups.
It will take a collective effort to help save the lives of people and the planet. Promisingly, IPBES is seeking to join forces with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change by its Eighth Session in 2021 to find solutions at the nexus of these two issues. We have a call-to-action and a way forward.
The question remains: can we organise quickly enough to act on it?

ERMA in the Arctic
As Arctic warms and sea ice contracts and thins, activities including vessel transportation, energy exploration, and tourism activities are increasing. As human presence increases, so does the risk of oil spills. NOAA’s ERMA is a critical tool for equipping responders to prepare for, respond to, and assess the impacts of environmental disasters in this remote region. In addition to working with Federal and State partners, NOAA also works with indigenous communities to learn how ERMA can best be used to protect the natural resources and unique lifestyle of the region.
ERMA and Emergency Response
- ERMA brings together information like the extent and concentration of sea ice, port and pipeline locations, and sensitive habitats, into one online tool. This allows experts to access data quickly and efficiently in the event of disasters like oil spills.
- ERMA integrates real-time data (like weather and ice radar) with static data (like port locations) into a single interactive map. This allows experts to visualize evolving situations on-the-ground to protect human life, property, and the environment.
- Arctic ERMA can be used as a tool for collaboration among Arctic nations for planning and emergency response actions. Data from Canada, Russia and Norway are available and can be viewed in a variety of regionally-specific polar projections.
ERMA and Environmental Restoration
- When disasters like oil spills strike, you need to have a solid understanding of how the environment was before to calculate what the damages are after. This process of Natural Resource Damage Assessment is how NOAA and our co-trustees reach agreements with those responsible for pollution to fund restoration.
- Arctic ERMA stores data like critical habitats for Arctic cod, the locations and times of year protected marine mammals like belugas and humpback whales can be found, and locations and contact information for trained personnel that is critical to guide assessment and restoration.
- NOAA uses Arctic ERMA to assess natural resources at risk from pollution, plan for and track injury assessment, and determine appropriate restoration in the event of an oil or chemical spill.",,,,,2020-12-16,response.restoration.noaa.gov

Established by the Ottawa Declaration in 1996, the Arctic Council is the preeminent intergovernmental forum for addressing issues related to the Arctic Region. The members of the Arctic Council include the eight Arctic States (Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, the Russian Federation, and the United States). The Arctic Council is not a treaty-based international organization but rather an international forum that operates on the basis of consensus, echoing the peaceful and cooperative nature of the Arctic Region. The Council focuses its work on matters related to sustainable development, the environmental protection; its mandate explicitly excludes military security. Traditionally, the Council is chaired by the foreign minister of the country holding the chairmanship. Its day-to-day work is carried out by the eight Senior Arctic Officials (SAO) and six PP representatives, with input from working groups, expert groups, and task forces. To learn more about the Arctic Council, please visit their website at: www.arctic-council.org .
The United States held the rotating chairmanship of the Arctic Council from 1998-2000 and 2015-2017. More information on the 2015-2017 U.S. Chairmanship and 10th Ministerial Meeting can be found here.
Arctic Science Agreement (2017)
In May 2017, the eight Arctic States signed the Agreement on Enhancing International Arctic Scientific Cooperation during the 10th Arctic Council Ministerial in Fairbanks, Alaska. This is the third legally binding agreement negotiated under the auspices of the Arctic Council. The agreement facilitates access by scientists of the eight Arctic States to Arctic areas that each State has identified, including entry and exit of persons, equipment, and materials; access to research infrastructure and facilities; and access to research areas. The agreement also calls for the parties to promote education and training of scientists working on Arctic matters.
The geographic area, as defined by the Arctic Research and Policy Act of 1984 , covered by this agreement in the United States includes territory north of the Arctic Circle and north and west of the boundary formed by the Porcupine, Yukon, and Kuskokwim Rivers; the Aleutian chain; and adjacent marine areas in the Arctic Ocean and the Beaufort, Bering, and Chukchi Seas.
The point of contact for this agreement for the United States is the U.S. Arctic Research Commission , which can be reached at (703) 525-0113 or info@arctic.gov.
Arctic Marine Oil Pollution Preparedness and Response Agreement (2013)
In May 2013, the eight Arctic States signed the Agreement on Cooperation on Marine Oil Pollution Preparedness and Response in the Arctic during the 9th Arctic Council Ministerial in Kiruna, Sweden. This is the second legally binding agreement negotiated under the auspices of the Arctic Council. The agreement strengthens cooperation, coordination, and mutual assistance among Arctic nations on oil pollution preparedness and response in the region to protect the marine environment. The agreement is helping to forge strong partnerships in advance of an oil spill so that Arctic countries can quickly and cooperatively respond before it endangers lives and threatens fragile ecosystems.
Arctic Search and Rescue (SAR) Agreement (2011)
In May 2011, the eight Arctic States signed the Agreement on Cooperation on Aeronautical and Maritime Search and Rescue in the Arctic during the 8th Arctic Council Ministerial in Nuuk, Greenland (Denmark). This is the first legally binding agreement negotiated under the auspices of the Arctic Council. It coordinates life-saving international maritime and aeronautical SAR coverage and response among the Arctic States across an area of about 13 million square miles in the Arctic. The SAR Agreement will improve search and rescue response in the Arctic by committing all Parties to coordinate appropriate assistance to those in distress and to cooperate with each other in undertaking SAR operations. For each Party, the Agreement defines an area of the Arctic in which it will have lead responsibility in organizing responses to SAR incidents, both large and small. Parties to the Agreement commit to provide SAR assistance regardless of the nationality or status of persons who may need it.

10 Intriguing Mysteries Of The Arctic
The Great White North is a forbidding and eerie place, which has spawned many fantastic stories and tales of folklore. Even in the real world, there are many historical and scientific mysteries about the frozen reaches beyond the Arctic Circle. As climate change starts to melt the ice, some mysteries may be solved, while others will remain forever obscured by the thaw.
10Levanevsky’s Flight
In 1937, the famed Soviet pilot Sigizmund Levanevsky took charge of what was intended to be the first cargo-passenger flight over the North Pole from Moscow to Fairbanks, Alaska. The distance was enormous, and experts thought that a full year of preparation would be needed. In a bid to impress Stalin, the officials in charge decided to do it in three months. The risks were so obvious that the aircraft’s radio officer even joked that the crew members were flying to their deaths. Unsurprisingly, something went wrong, and the man known to the American press as “the Russian Lindbergh” disappeared along with his six-man crew.
During takeoff, the far-right engine was clearly emitting smoke, but engineers on the ground predicted it would soon stop. Nineteen hours later, a radio message was received: “The far-right engine has quit due to a problem with the oil system. Entering overcast skies. Elevation 4,600 meters. Will attempt a landing.” Russian, Canadian, and American rescue teams combed the Arctic, but no trace of the aircraft could be found.
Over the years, there have been various theories about the final resting place of Levanevsky and his crew. The most plausible involves a radio operator from Point Barrow, Alaska, who was told local Inuit had witnessed an aircraft crash into the water near the Jones Islands. A visiting schooner attempted a search of the area, with the crew noting that their compass needle was pointing straight down at one point. However, no wreckage could be found and the search had to be called off due to ice. A report was sent to Moscow, but it was quickly forgotten about after World War II broke out.
Another theory suggests that there was a navigational error when the flight crossed the North Pole and was forced to descend below cloud level. Unbeknownst to the crew, they ended up making an accidental 80-degree turn, headed back into the Soviet Union, and crashed into Siberia’s Lake Sebyan-Kyuyel. A magnetic anomoly was apparently detected in the depths of the lake, but no more evidence could be found and the theory largely ran out of steam in the late ’90s.
Perhaps the most ridiculous theory is that Levanevsky was forced to land on an ice floe, where he was rescued by a German submarine. He then supposedly offered his services to the Luftwaffe, even participating in the bombing of Moscow.
9The Dorset Culture
The Paleo-Eskimos were among the first people to colonize the North American Arctic, long before the arrival of the ancestors of modern Inuit. For over 4,000 years, they lived in isolation from other peoples, gradually developing the Dorset culture of northern Canada and Greenland. But they quickly vanished after AD 1300, leaving little trace of their presence. DNA testing done on the hair, bone, and teeth remains of 169 Paleo-Eskimos from northern Greenland revealed that they were genetically distinct from indigenous groups living in Greenland, northern Canada, the Aleutian Islands, and Siberia.
Their isolation seems to have led to inbreeding, which could have contributed to their sudden disappearance. Other potential causes probably include climate shifts which reduced their traditional food supplies and competition from new migrant groups armed with bows and other comparatively advanced technology. According to anthropologist William Fitzhugh, “the Dorsets were the Hobbits of the eastern Arctic—a very strange and very conservative people who we’re only just getting to know a little bit.”
Even their name causes some controversy—since the term “Eskimo” is not preferred by modern Inuit, the expression “Paleo-Eskimo” to describe previous inhabitants of the region is a bit problematic. The Inuit themselves have an oral history of encounters with a people they called the Tuniit, which may have led to the transfer of certain Tuniit technologies to the Inuit, including how to build snow houses and find soapstone and meteor iron.
8The Monster Of Lake Iliamna
The largest body of fresh water in Alaska, Lake Iliamna is often considered the state’s answer to Loch Ness, with frequent reports of giant creatures lurking in the depths. These creatures have also been sighted in the Kvichak River, which runs from Lake Iliamna to the ocean. The Aleut traditionally avoided fishing in the lake, believing it to be dangerous, while pilots have reported seeing monstrous creatures from the air since the 1940s. The most likely explanation is that the lake hosts a population of white sturgeon, a thick-scaled fish once known to grow up to 6 meters (20 ft) long. (The largest modern sturgeon are usually “only” about half that length.) However, nobody has ever found proof of Lake Iliamna sturgeon, so that remains simply a theory.
More recently, biologist Bruce Wright has suggested that the “monsters” might actually be Pacific sleeper sharks, which can also grow up to 6 meters (20 ft). On the other side of the continent, scientists have documented Greenland sharks navigating the St. Lawrence River. Pacific sleeper sharks are fairly similar to Greenland sharks, suggesting that they might also be able to survive in freshwater. Lake Iliamna is teeming with salmon and other fish, providing an enticing food source for hungry sharks. But, again, no evidence of their presence in the lake has been found, so don’t panic and cancel that Alaskan beach holiday just yet.
7Rain-On-Snow
In recent years, a mysterious meteorological phenomena has been observed in the Arctic, in which northern snows slowly turn into rain. Instead of melting the snow already on the ground, the rainwater seeps through the snowpack, pools on top of the frozen soil, and then freezes into an impenetrable shell which prevents animals from grazing. In 2003, 20,000 musk-ox starved to death following a rain-on-snow event on Canada’s Banks Island. Some of the oxen were so hungry they tried to find food on floating ice and were seen drifting out to sea.
The phenomenon has been reported in Russia, Sweden, Finland, and Canada and could be disastrous for Arctic inhabitants who rely on grazing animal populations for meat and clothing. Some scientists have begun using microwave-imagery satellites to better track the phenomena, as rain-on-snow events cause detectable changes in the microwave radiation signature of the snowpack. Many believe that rain-on-snow events are related to climate change and may increase in the future, with potentially devastating effects.
6Baffin Island Vikings
Ever since the Viking settlement at L’Anse aux Meadows in Newfoundland was discovered in 1978, archaeologists have been scouring the east coast of North America for other evidence of Norse settlements. In 2012, a dig led by archeologist Patricia Sutherland north of the Arctic Circle on Canada’s Baffin Island discovered some intriguing whetstones, complete with grooves containing traces of a copper alloy (most likely bronze). Such materials were foreign to the Inuit, but were used by Viking smiths.
Other evidence bolstered the idea that there was a Norse presence in the region. In 1999, two strands of cloth were discovered on Baffin Island. The strands differed from the animal sinew cords used by the Inuit, but were identical to yarn made by Norse women in Greenland in the 1400s. Other intriguing artifacts included wooden tally sticks for recording transactions, fragments of Old World rat pelts, and a whalebone shovel similar to those used in Greenland. Many researchers remain skeptical, but Sutherland believes that there was a significant Norse presence in the Canadian Arctic, trading with the locals for luxuries like walrus ivory and Arctic furs.
Sutherland’s most significant claim is that a stone artifact found at a Dorset site in 1960 contained traces of metal and glass and is actually a Norse crucible used for melting bronze. If that’s the case, the artifact would suggest an actual Norse presence, as opposed to Norse trade goods being re-traded between the Dorset in Greenland and Canada.
Controversy erupted when Sutherland was abruptly fired from her post at the Canadian Museum of History. Sutherland intimated during a radio interview that her dismissal was politically motivated, as her work was “out of step with Ottawa’s view of Canadian history.” According to Sutherland, the government was more interested in funding research into British voyages like the Franklin expedition, which would support Canada’s sovereignty claims in the Arctic. However, the museum strongly denied the charges, claiming that she had been “terminated for harassment following an 18-month investigation done by an independent third party.”
5The Zeleny Yar Necropolis
In 2014, archaeologists at Zeleny Yar near the town of Salekhard in the Siberian Arctic discovered 34 shallow graves, suggesting the isolated area was a trading post around the 12th or 13th century AD. Eleven bodies were found with shattered bones or crushed skulls, while five mummified adult males were found shrouded in copper plates and wrapped in reindeer, beaver, wolverine, or bear fur. One of the men had red hair and was buried with an iron hatchet and a bronze belt buckle with a bear design. Three mummified infants were also discovered, wearing copper masks and bound with copper hoops.
All the corpses were buried pointing toward the Gorny Poluy River, which possibly had religious significance. Among the artifacts found were an iron combat knife, a silver medallion, a bronze bird figurine, and a number of bronze bowls originating in Persia. It’s believed that the mummification of the bodies was an accident, caused by the use of non-oxidizing copper and the drop in regional temperature around the 14th century.
In 2015, another set of human remains was discovered, wrapped in a birch bark “cocoon.” MRI scanning detected the presence of metal and the cocoon was opened to reveal the mummified remains of a young boy, aged around six or seven, wrapped in animal fur and equipped with a bronze axe, a bear-shaped pendant, and a number of metal head rings. The elaborate nature of the burial suggests that the boy was from a higher social class than the other bodies. Archaeologists continue to work at the site, trying to discover more about this lost Arctic culture.
4The Flight Of The Eagle
Salomon August Andree was a young Swedish engineer who became enraptured with balloon technology while studying in the United States in the 1870s. At the time, no expedition had ever succeeded in reaching the North Pole, and Andree became convinced that the feat could best be achieved via hydrogen balloon. Such balloons could theoretically stay in flight for 30 days, though in practice none had stayed up for more than 15. Nevertheless, Andree persuaded himself that if he took off as close to the Pole as possible, he would be able to sail overhead and land in Alaska.
His balloon, named the Ornen (“Eagle”), was built in Paris with a generous financial contribution from the Swedish king. Made from varnished silk, the balloon was almost 30 meters (100 ft) high and weighed 1.5 tons. Andree personally designed a system of guide ropes and sails for maneuvering against the wind and a cookstove that hung outside the basket in order to keep it away from the flammable hydrogen. In July 1897, Andree, civil engineer Knut Fraenkel, and physics professor Nils Strindberg lifted off from the Norwegian island of Svalbard. They were never seen again.
Three decades later, a group of geologists and seal hunters landed on the uninhabited White Island (now Kvitoya) and found the ruins of a camp, complete with a bleached skull which “lay there smiling dreadfully.” Helpfully, there was also a neatly lettered sign reading “Andree’s Polar Expedition of 1897.” Diary entries revealed that the balloon had descended until it was bumping against the ice, probably due to gaps in the sealant allowing hydrogen to escape. The group was forced to abandon the expedition 65 hours after their departure, about 500 kilometers (300 mi) from where they had started. Strindberg took the picture above shortly after the landing.
The trio was well supplied (they even had chocolate cake) and initially survived fairly well. However, an attempt to reach Franz Josef Land failed and the group started to head back toward Spitzbergen. But they only made it to White Island before meeting their mysterious demise.
To this day, we’re not clear how or why the men died. It does seem that Strindberg died first, perhaps of a polar bear attack, and was partially buried in a rock outcropping. A short time later, Andree and Fraenkel died while huddled together in a sleeping bag, leaving valuable equipment casually strewn around the camp. Some speculate that they contracted trichinosis from poorly cooked polar bear meat (Andree’s diary refers to polar bears as “the wandering meat shops of the Arctic”). Another theory claims that they asphyxiated due to gas from a malfunctioning stove. Or perhaps they simply perished due to exposure. In 1930, the remains of the aeronauts were returned to Sweden for an official funeral at Storkyrkan Cathedral.
3Chukchi Sea Blob
In 2009, a group of hunters spotted a mysterious blob in the Chuckchi Sea between Alaska and Russia. It was described as a dark, oily, and hairy mass that stretched for miles through the frigid Arctic waters. Many feared an oil spill, but testing indicated the blob was actually an unusual algae bloom. However, residents were still concerned, as such blooms can be toxic and poison sea life. The Inupiat Inuit, who live along Alaska’s northern coast, said they had never seen anything like it before. Though testing to determine the species of the algae was inconclusive, it has been theorized that it may have been an exotic species that drifted into the region, possibly due to climate change.
Large algal blooms are a natural occurrence given the right nutrients, light, and water temperature. Although it seems odd for a bloom to occur in icy northern waters, it may be that we have underestimated the capacity for life to thrive in such conditions. In 2012, the NASA-sponsored ICESCAPE expedition found a massive phytoplankton bloom under the ice in the Chukchi Sea. The scientists actually expected their phytoplankton-detecting instruments would give a value of zero, but it turned out there was more phytoplankton under the ice than there was in the open water.
2Aurora Sounds
For years, it has been a mainstay of Arctic myth that the aurora borealis makes sounds. The Labrador Inuit believed the spirits of those who died a voluntary or violent death, known as selamiut (“sky-dwellers”), lived near a hole in the heavens and created the aurora to guide the recently deceased, making clapping sounds to communicate with the living. Such stories were generally dismissed by scientists, who insisted the phenomenon was too far away to emit sounds audible to humans.
However, recent research in Finland has indicated that there is some truth to the old stories. According to Aalto University’s Unto Laine, the aurora itself is indeed too far away to make an audible noise, but the clapping noise “is likely caused by the same energetic particles from the sun that create the northern lights far away in the sky. These particles or the geomagnetic disturbance produced by them seem to create sound much closer to the ground.”
While this has shown that there is a noise associated with the aurora, the exact mechanisms that create it remain unclear, and some believe there may be multiple causes. One possibility is electrophonic hearing, which occurs when the auditory nerves are stimulated by electromagnetic fields (hence why some people hear clicking noises during lightning storms). Another possibility is brush discharge, in which the same ionization effects producing the aurora reach ground level at a much lower intensity, causing a buildup of static electricity. That results in tiny sparks discharging into the atmosphere, which might just be audible to human ears.
Another theory involves a phenomenon known as electrophonic transduction. We know auroras can produce VLF radio waves, which can be converted into sound waves by long, thin conductors like grass or hair. So the sounds of the northern lights might reach the ground as radio waves, only to be played back audibly by the foliage.
1The Inventio Fortunata
In the 14th century, somebody wrote a travelogue called the Inventio Fortunata (“Discovery Of Fortunata”), which purportedly described a voyage to the far north by a Franciscan priest from Oxford. It was presented to the English crown in 1360 but was lost at some point in the 15th century. A Dutchman named Jacobus Cnoyen included much of the information from the Inventio Fortunata in his own travel book, but that was also lost. Luckily, Cnoyen’s version was extensively quoted in a letter from the Flemish cartographer Gerard Mercator to the English courtier and alchemist John Dee.
In the letter, Mercator includes “word for word everything that I copied out of [Cnoyen’s book] years ago,” so we can be fairly sure we have an accurate version of the Inventio Fortunata‘s description of the Arctic:
In the midst of the four countries is a Whirl-pool, into which there empty these four indrawing Seas which divide the North. And the water rushes round and descends into the Earth just as if one were pouring it through a filter funnel. It is four degrees wide on every side of the Pole, that is to say eight degrees altogether. Except that right under the Pole there lies a bare Rock in the midst of the Sea. Its circumference is almost 33 French miles, and it is all of magnetic Stone.
The Inventio Fortunata was extremely influential on contemporary European descriptions of the Pole, which often cited the giant magnetic rock as the reason compasses pointed north. Knowledge of the Arctic was sketchy during the period, to the point that a mysterious island known as Frisland was often depicted between Iceland and Greenland, possibly as a result of 14th-century Venetian navigators accidentally mapping the coast of Iceland twice.
It took until the 17th century for the Inventio Fortunata‘s influence to finally disappear from maps of the Arctic. Oddly, nobody seems to know who actually wrote it, although Dee believed it was the mathematician Nicolas of Lynn. Others believe the ideas expressed in the work show the influence of Norse exploration and mythology, as the giant whirlpool seems similar to the great abyss Ginnungaggap, which the Norse believed formed the boundary of the oceans.

Lichens are a conspicuous and colorful component of Alaska’s vegetation and one of the most species-rich groups of organisms to inhabit the Arctic. A lichen is a composite organism consisting of a fungus and an alga and/or cyanobacteria growing together in a symbiotic partnership. Together they are intimately connected to their environment. Lichens are highly sensitive to environmental conditions including airborne contaminants, substrate chemistry, and climate and are good indicators of environmental change.
They can be found in all types of ecosystems, from intertidal zones to the tops of mountains—even on nunataks (the exposed rock outcrops of icefields). They grow on soil, rock, bark, wood, barnacles, and buildings. Lichens are ecologically important as food, shelter, and nesting material for wildlife; and play important roles in hydrological and mineral cycles, notably nitrogen fixation.

Lichens are ecologically important as food, shelter, and nesting material for wildlife; and play important roles in hydrological and mineral cycles, notably nitrogen fixation.
Recent inventories conducted in Arctic Alaska parks have revealed high lichen diversity. Across the Western Arctic Parklands, over 500 lichen species have been discovered, including at least 16 that are newly described in Alaska or North America and three that are newly described to science (Holt and Neitlich 2010, Nelson et al. 2015). Many of these species are circumpolar and also distributed outside the Arctic, though the majority are confined to Arctic-alpine habitats.
Lichen species are an important component of the many biological communities across Arctic Alaska. Recently, patterns in Arctic lichen community composition have received attention in response to expanding shrub communities and increasing fire frequency and extent, both of which are linked to declines in lichen abundance. Because lichens are often a major component of forage consumed by caribou, such as by the Western Arctic Caribou Herd estimated at 234,000 individuals, and is one of the largest free-roaming herds in North America, the consequences of lichen habitat decline could be substantial for the ecosystem and the local subsistence communities (Joly et al. 2010).
Because certain lichen species are both abundant and sensitive to changes in the environment, they can serve as useful indicators for detecting long-term trends in the larger ecological community, including the effects of changing air quality. Lichens lack roots and largely rely upon the atmosphere for their water and nutrients. Because they do not have an outer epidermal layer, they cannot discriminate between nutrients and pollutants, and absorb both.
When exposed to even low levels of certain pollutants, particularly sensitive species will decline or die, making lichen community composition a good indicator of ecosystem health. In park units such as Cape Krusenstern National Monument, lichen communities are being used to monitor mine-related and fugitive dust-borne heavy metals along the Red Dog Mine haul road. Recent findings confirm that lichen species richness decreases the closer they are to the haul road (Figure 1; Neitlich et al. 2017).

This Review considers recent primary productivity trends and the environmental drivers, as well as how these are changing, that drive phytoplankton diversity in the region.","Abstract
Changes in the Arctic atmosphere, cryosphere and Ocean are drastically altering the dynamics of phytoplankton, the base of marine ecosystems. This Review addresses four major complementary questions of ongoing Arctic Ocean changes and associated impacts on phytoplankton productivity, phenology and assemblage composition. We highlight trends in primary production over the last two decades while considering how multiple environmental drivers shape Arctic biogeography. Further, we consider changes to Arctic phenology by borealization and hidden under-ice blooms, and how the diversity of phytoplankton assemblages might evolve in a novel Arctic ‘biogeochemical landscape’. It is critical to understand these aspects of changing Arctic phytoplankton dynamics as they exert pressure on marine Arctic ecosystems in addition to direct effects from rapid environmental changes.

Why is industry interest so weak?,A lease sale in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska is set for January 6. But drilling proponents are battling economic headwinds.,"The end of one of the greatest environmental battles in modern American history is near—and it could go either way.
On one side is the oil-friendly Trump Administration and the state of Alaska, which, along with a few native corporations on the North Slope, are heavily dependent on oil tax revenue. On the other are nearly all the major national environmental organizations, the Gwich’in people of Alaska and Canada, and, according to recent polls, the majority of Americans. At stake is nothing less than the crown jewel of American wilderness.
On January 6, 2021, the U.S. Bureau of Land Management plans to auction off leases for oil and gas development on more than one million acres of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR), in the northeast corner of Alaska. That same day, Congress will meet to confirm the election of Joe Biden as president. Biden opposes drilling in the refuge.
Created in 1960 by President Dwight D. Eisenhower and expanded in 1980 by President Jimmy Carter, ANWR is the largest intact wilderness ecosystem in the United States. The 40-year battle is over its coastal plain, which may conceal billions of barrels of oil—but is also what environmental advocates call the refuge’s “biological heart,” a breeding ground for caribou and polar bears, as well as important habitat for more than 200 other species, including snow geese and many other migratory birds. (See photos of the wildlife in the refuge.)
As one of its final acts, the Trump Administration is trying to lock in a future of oil drilling on the coastal plain just weeks before President-elect Biden takes office on January 20. Seismic testing may begin the day after Biden’s inauguration—in the midst of denning season for the most threatened population of polar bears in the Arctic. The testing involves a fleet of heavy thumper trucks that will crisscross the fragile tundra, shaking the ground to create seismic waves that can show the presence of oil.
Yet there is good reason to doubt that oil drilling in ANWR will take place anytime soon. Four lawsuits challenging the lease sale are pending in federal court in Anchorage; the judge has promised to rule today on a motion to halt the sale. If the judge allows the sale to go through, any company that acquired a lease would still need numerous permits from the Biden Administration before drilling could begin.
More importantly, the economic winds are blowing against Arctic drilling. Oil prices are low, the cost of drilling in the Arctic is high, and after a year of devastating fires, floods, heat waves, and hurricanes around the world, concern over climate risk is surging among investors. All of which may have changed the calculus for oil companies.
“What we do here has a global impact,” says Brook Brisson, an attorney representing the Gwich’in Steering Committee in the current lawsuits. “Birds, weather patterns, coastlines. No one has been untouched by climate change in the last four years. Ecosystem protection now has real value, especially as climate protection.”
Alaska’s industrial development authority is so concerned about the industry’s lack of interest in ANWR that just before Christmas it authorized its director to spend $20 million on any unleased tracts to secure them until a drilling partner could be found. In an op-ed in the Anchorage Daily News, former governor and senator Frank Murkowski had argued that it might be the state’s last chance to open the refuge to drilling.
Politics, meet economics
For decades, Murkowski and other Alaska politicians have seen the refuge as an extension of Prudhoe Bay, the nation’s largest oil field and the state’s aging cash cow, which has been in steady decline since 1988. In 2017, Murkowski’s daughter, Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), managed to slip a provision mandating two ANWR lease sales of at least 400,000 acres each into the massive federal tax cut bill. She and the Trump Administration estimated that the oil field might ultimately generate $100 billion in revenue for the federal treasury.
Those calculations assumed at least seven billion barrels of oil in ANWR, at a price of more than $78 per barrel. The current price is $47, and no one really knows how much oil lies beneath that coastal plain.
Based on a single seismic survey done in the mid-1980s, and the results from wells drilled outside the refuge, the U.S. Geological Survey estimates the refuge may hold between 4.3 billion and 11.8 billion barrels of “technically recoverable” oil. How much of it is economically recoverable is another matter.
At the annual Alaska Resource Conference held online in November, Joe Marushack, President of ConocoPhillips Alaska, informed the virtual crowd that there were no rigs drilling on the North Slope for the first time in the 60-year history of the field. ConocoPhillips is the largest producer in Alaska, with extensive holdings in Prudhoe and in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska (NPR-A). During the Q&A, someone asked Marushack about his company’s interest in ANWR leases.
“We really like what we are doing right now in NPR-A,” he replied. “We’ll probably focus on that area.”
“There will continue to be the need to explore and develop oil and gas on the North Slope,” ExxonMobil Alaska’s CEO, Darlene Gates reassured the virtual crowd. “It’s important not to give up on a growth mindset.” But then she showed a chart comparing estimated returns on investment at oil fields around the world, from the Gulf of Mexico to the North Sea to Angola to the North Slope. Alaska oil was by far the least profitable due to its high cost of production.
“Looking as an investor,” Gates said, “where would you put your money?”
BP answered that question last summer by selling all its assets in Alaska—after 60 years in the state—to Houston-based Hilcorp, Inc., a privately held company specializing in squeezing the last drop out of dying oil fields. Among those assets were leases on lands that lie within ANWR but are indigenous-owned by the Kaktovik Inupiat Corporation.
The only test well ever drilled in the refuge, in the early 1980s, was on one of those leases, and the results of that test is one of the most tightly guarded secrets in the oil industry. A 2006 National Geographic investigation reported the well was a “dry hole,” based on numerous sources that had access to the well data. BP executives certainly knew what was down that hole, and were on the cusp of being able to develop their leases there for the first time in 40 years, thanks to the Trump Administration—and they walked away.
“If someone is voting with their feet and dollars, you have to wonder what is there,” says Mouhcine Guettabi, associate professor of economics at the University of Alaska, Anchorage. “There’s a lot of uncertainty about the amount of oil.”
Even more uncertain is how oil companies would finance a multi-billion-dollar development in ANWR, which has no infrastructure or pipeline to carry oil out of the refuge. More than 60 financial institutions around the world have pledged to restrict or stop financing Arctic oil exploration, including all five major U.S. banks. One of those is Goldman-Sachs, whose senior energy analyst told CNBC in 2017, “We think there is almost no rationale for Arctic exploration.”
Thawing permafrost, melting dollars
The financial challenges to drilling anywhere in the Arctic stem from the physical challenges—and those are increasing, thanks to fossil fuels themselves. The Arctic is warming twice as fast as the rest of the planet, turning rock-hard frozen permafrost into a land of lakes, sinkholes, and boggy peat in the summer. Last June, after weeks of record high temperatures that hit over 100 degrees Fahrenheit, a giant diesel fuel tank in the Siberian city of Norilsk sank into the tundra and ruptured, spilling 21,000 metric tons (157,500 barrels) of fuel—nearly half the amount spilled by the Exxon Valdez tanker off Alaska in 1989—and creating the largest spill in modern Russian history.
Most of the oil and gas infrastructure in the Russian Arctic, such as the giant Bovanenkova gas field on the Yamal Peninsula is built atop permafrost, just as it is on Alaska’s North Slope. “If this ice melts the landscape changes dramatically,” says Vladimir Romanovsky, a permafrost researcher at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. “You get massive subsidence, ten meters or more on the Yamal Peninsula.
“All the big buildings at Bovanenkova are built on a refrigerated system of horizontal pipes that keep the ground frozen,” he goes on. “That’s really expensive to do. ANWR has the same geology.”
A few years ago a group of climate researchers tried to model how much of the world’s fossil fuel reserves must go unburned if we are to keep global warming below 2°C (3.6°F), the widely accepted threshold of dangerous climate change. They concluded that 80 percent of the world’s remaining coal, half the natural gas, and a third of current oil reserves must stay in the ground. In the economically optimum solution, that would include all the super-expensive oil and gas in the Arctic. Most of the world’s largest consumers of fossil fuels have committed to deep cuts in their use under the Paris Agreement, throwing long-term demand for oil in doubt.
Russia, however, which gets a sizable fraction of its GDP and international clout from Arctic energy resources, is going in the opposite direction.
“In the new climate era, more and more nations are setting goals for going off oil and gas,” says Sherri Goodman, a former senior defense official in the Obama Administration, now a senior fellow at the Wilson Center’s Polar Institute. “If you are a Russian energy planner looking at the prospect of less demand in the coming decades, you may want to step on the gas to produce as much as possible so you won’t have a stranded asset in the Arctic.”
The 50th state has the same problem.
Stranded in Alaska
In Alaska, the only state with neither an income nor a sales tax, the state budget depends heavily on oil industry taxes. When oil prices began their initial slide in 2014, Alaska plunged into what has become the longest recession in its history, according to UAA’s Guettabi. Over the last six years the state has nearly drained its “rainy day fund,” stashed away for such oil busts. It has been forced to slash government services and trim the annual checks Alaskans receive from the state’s $71-billion Permanent Fund, also fueled by oil money.
Meanwhile, oil companies have cut their workforce in Alaska by more than half, from 15,000 in 2015 to 6,900 in 2019. And that was before the pandemic hit, pushing 40,000 more Alaskans out of work. Despite enduring numerous booms and busts since oil began flowing down the Trans-Alaska Pipeline in 1977, the state has yet to wean itself off oil.
If the state does spend $20 million acquiring ANWR leases—essentially going into the oil business itself—it would be a spectacularly poor investment, according to Tim Buckley, a former Citigroup director now with the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.
Buckley has been tracking the financial and investment firms that have pledged to no longer invest in Arctic oil and gas projects. In one recent report, he calculated that Blackrock, the world’s largest fund manager with more than $7 trillion in assets, lost $90 billion from its oil and gas investments. In November, Blackrock CEO Larry Fink predicted a “tsunami of change” in asset reallocation, as investors flee fossil fuels.
“The economics are making the case,” says Buckley. “Exxon stock prices are down 40 percent when the market as a whole is up 15 percent, and renewables are up eight percent. When oil prices hit zero in April, they lost half of their market capitalization in just four months. And it wasn’t just Exxon. It was BP, Total, Chevron. Profitability just evaporated in huge swaths of the energy market.”
Some of that demand will return after the pandemic, he says. But he believes the writing is on the wall for fossil fuels—and Arctic oil and gas in particular. In yet another blow, Lloyd’s, the world’s largest insurance market, pledged last month to stop insuring any new energy projects in the Arctic by January 2022, and to end all such policies by 2030. That will make financing such undertakings even harder.
“Financial markets are very good at assessing risk,” Buckley says. “And what they are telling us is that you lose money investing in fossil fuels. You lose huge amounts of money. So why as a rational investor would you do it? We are in the endgame of fossil fuels.”",,,Environment,,2021-01-05,National Geographic

Beijing has long regarded the Arctic as consequential to its strategic, economic and environmental interests. China also believes that, in line with international legal treaties — especially the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and the Spitsbergen Treaty — it enjoys such rights as scientific research, freedom of navigation, and overflight, fishery, cable-laying and resource development in the Arctic high seas.
Even before the Arctic policy was unveiled, Beijing gradually expanded its footprint in the region. Notably, since 1999, the Chinese have conducted numerous Arctic expeditions and built their first research base, the Yellow River Station on Svalbard Island in 2004. Generally, China’s current policy involves the acquisition of knowledge about the region; protecting, exploiting and participating in the management of the Arctic Ocean; safeguarding the international community’s common interests; and promoting its sustainable development in the region.
China’s better-known Arctic activities are primarily economic, especially energy cooperation with Russia. As part of Beijing’s effort to wean off coal dependence for power generation and to bolster energy security, in December 2019, it inaugurated the 3,000-kilometer-long “Power of Siberia” natural gas pipeline linking Russia’s Siberian fields to northeast China. Chinese companies also play key roles in the Arctic LNG 2, the second major natural gas project currently under development in the Russian Arctic.
Energy aside, China’s collaboration with Russia on establishing a global transport corridor via the Northern Sea Route, or NSR, has in recent times seized no small amount of attention. Experts believe this route would be around 40 percent faster than the same journey via the Suez Canal, significantly slashing fuel costs. With global warming and the consequent opening up of more ice-free periods per year, the prospect of opening up international Arctic shipping via the NSR becomes brighter.
In order to make the NSR safe and commercially viable, Russia envisaged a network of port terminals and logistics centers along the route, which would therefore require massive investments beyond what Moscow’s limited coffers can offer. In this respect, China’s Belt and Road Initiative becomes an attractive proposition when it comes to the promise of major funding for infrastructure development, with Russian President Vladimir Putin seeking the inclusion of the NSR as part of China’s 21st Century Maritime Silk Road under the “Polar Silk Road” notion.
Still, questions about the slower speed of transit through ice, the need for ice-class vessels that also adds costs, and unpredictable transit times for just-in-time shipping as well as shallow waters dominating the Russian coast along the NSR led to hesitancy among shipping companies.
Much to China’s ire, Japan’s regional influence is becoming the norm
Japan is continuing to enhance its security presence in Asia and the western Pacific, as the government seeks to counter China’s military activities in the region.
Purely scientific research for mankind?
China’s strategic interests in the Arctic, however, have largely been overshadowed by its economic interests, even though in recent times this aspect has become magnified through the broader geopolitical rivalry with the United States. In a speech at the Arctic Council ministerial meeting in May 2019, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo warned of the dangers of Chinese investment in the Arctic.
Beijing generally believes that Washington is seeking an anti-China containment scheme using the Arctic as another strategic front. Some Chinese scholars and military strategists, for example, viewed the recent U.S. withdrawal from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty and President Donald Trump’s interest in purchasing Greenland as part of the broader U.S. strategy to enhance nuclear deterrence, which could envisage the installation of a network of missile defense and post-INF Treaty offensive missile systems in the Arctic to counter both China and Russia.
It is with this strategic context in mind that China’s lesser known, scientific interest in the Arctic becomes something to scrutinize closely. The numerous Arctic scientific research activities, especially made more prominent by the frequent deployment of an icebreaker, have been particularly interesting. Such expeditions incrementally add new, updated information into China’s expanding knowledge database on the Arctic’s climactic, meteorological, geomagnetic and marine environmental conditions.
To be sure, such expeditions might be easily passed off as purely civilian scientific research that contributes to future economic programs in the region. For example, the first China-Russia joint Arctic expedition in 2016 could be regarded as paving the way for future development of the NSR. And the same could even be said of the Arctic Science Observatory, which was jointly inaugurated by China and Iceland in 2018.
However, over the recent years Beijing has instituted a gradually expanding set of scientific research programs in the Arctic that clearly have both civilian and military applications. Since 2014, the Chinese Academy of Sciences kick-started an Arctic acoustic research program, which has been subsumed within the numerous expeditions to the region and involved placement of sensors for long-term ocean observation. It needs to be noted that China has broad interests in creating ocean observation networks on a global scale. As part of this endeavor, Chinese scientists are enthusiastically exploring underwater acoustic sensor networks, with the Arctic also in mind.
The year 2018, when China unveiled its Arctic policy, was a bumper year for Beijing’s ocean observation program in the Arctic. In August of that year, the ninth expedition installed China’s first unmanned ice station in the region to observe multiple fluxes in the ocean, the sea ice and the atmosphere. The station was described to serve as “an effective supplement [to the research] in the absence of scientific expedition vessels.” The same expedition also utilized for the first time China’s indigenously developed Haiyi underwater glider.
In December 2018, the Chinese Academy of Sciences launched a project for a cloud-based online platform using remote sensing and numerical models. The platform provides open access to Arctic ice, ocean, land and atmospheric data. The following August-September, China’s 10th Arctic research expedition was somewhat special; instead of deploying the workhorse icebreaker Xuelong (or Snow Dragon), the oceanographic research vessel Xiangyanghong 01 made its debut and deployed the indigenous Haiyan underwater glider for ocean observation.
These supposedly civilian, persistent ocean observation activities have inevitably provoked concerns among at least some of the Arctic littorals. For instance, Danish defense intelligence authorities warned in November 2019 that the Chinese People’s Liberation Army is increasingly utilizing scientific research as a means of entering the Arctic, describing such activities as not just a matter of science but serving a “dual purpose.”
The U.S. Defense Department’s annual report to Congress, “Military and Security Developments Involving the People’s Republic of China 2019,” was more specific, stating that China’s “civilian research could support a strengthened Chinese military presence in the Arctic Ocean, which could include deploying submarines to the region as a deterrent against nuclear attacks.”
China’s subtle creep into the Arctic
Chinese scholars believed that through bilateral negotiations with and authorization by the concerned coastal states, maritime user states establishing logistics bases in support of military activities can still be allowed within the former’s exclusive economic zones, so long as these do not interfere with both coastal and user states’ rights and freedoms therein. To date, it is difficult to imagine any Arctic littoral — not even Russia, with whom China has such an unprecedentedly close strategic partnership now — would allow Beijing to do that.
Given the suspicion among Arctic littorals toward Beijing’s intentions, and a rising chorus to prevent militarization of the region, China would most likely proceed cautiously, as it acknowledges difficulties in carrying out military activities without being subjected to backlash from the Arctic littorals and international community, especially where it concerns building military bases in the region, particularly pursuant to Article 9 of the Spitsbergen Treaty.
In the foreseeable future, Beijing is more likely to exploit the inherent rights and freedoms bestowed upon maritime user states by the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea, which would create room for military activities such as exercises and weapons tests on, over and under the high seas in the Arctic.
The deployment of military forces, including submarines, to utilize Arctic shipping lanes has been an idea toyed by the Chinese scholarship community. But because unilateral military activities would be deemed “extremely sensitive,” such operations are conducted under a legal framework of international security cooperation.
The existing Chinese scholarship also outlined possible ways to incrementally expand Beijing’s strategic security footprint in the Arctic:
- Creation of dual-use instead of purely military logistics support facilities.
- Persistent development of polar military technologies, especially through scientific research on the unique climatic and geomagnetic characteristics of the Arctic.
- Training of military personnel capable of operating under extreme cold conditions.
- Provision of humanitarian “public goods” services such as maritime and aeronautical search-and-rescue and disaster relief to Arctic littorals and user states.
In fact, even before unveiling its Arctic policy, Beijing paved the way forward for possible maritime security — possibly military — operations in the Arctic. In June 2017, China unveiled its “Vision for Maritime Cooperation under the Belt and Road Initiative,” which identified the Arctic shipping lanes as one of those “blue economic passages,” stressing the need for efforts to be made to “promote the concept of common maritime security for mutual benefits,” including proposed “joint development and sharing” initiatives such as maritime public services, ocean observation and monitoring networks, marine environmental surveys.
China’s dual-use scientific research activities will likely continue to persist; in the next stage of promoting maritime security cooperation that would presage future deployment of military assets to the Arctic, Beijing is likely to start with “white hull diplomacy,” namely the use of its Coast Guard. This includes possible participation in the Arctic Coast Guard Forum as a way to increase Beijing’s “voice” and its role in managing the Arctic.
It would appear that Beijing is already preparing for such a prospect. In late April, the Chinese Coast Guard conducted a maritime law enforcement exercise, code-named “Deep Sea Defender 2020,” on protecting international undersea internet cables — certainly an area of “common interest” in the Arctic.

The region surrounding the North Pole consists of a large ocean surrounded by land. This ocean, called the Arctic Ocean, is like no other ocean on Earth; and because of its special location and climate, the lands that surround it are unique.
Most commonly, scientists define the Arctic as the region above the Arctic Circle, an imaginary line that circles the globe at approximately 66° 34' N (dashed blue circle in the map at right). The Arctic Circle marks the latitude above which the sun does not set on the summer solstice, and does not rise on the winter solstice. At the North Pole, the sun rises once each year and sets once each year: there are six months of continuous daylight and six months of continuous night. At lower latitudes, but north of the Arctic Circle, the duration of continuous day and night are shorter.
But other people use different definitions when talking about the Arctic. Some scientists define the Arctic as the area north of the arctic tree line (green line in map at right), where the landscape is frozen and dotted with shrubs and lichens. Other researchers define Arctic based on temperature. Using this definition, the Arctic includes any locations in high latitudes where the average daily summer temperature does not rise above 10 degrees Celsius (50 degrees Fahrenheit).",,,,,,National Snow and Ice Data Center

ᐃᓄᒃᑎᑐᑦ
In the Arctic and in the North, as in the rest of Canada, safety, security and defence are essential prerequisites for healthy communities, strong economies, and a sustainable environment. This chapter of the Arctic and Northern Policy Framework lays out the objectives and activities that the Government of Canada will pursue through to 2030 as part of its commitment to a safe, secure, and well-defended Arctic and North, and as a continued expression of Canada's enduring sovereignty over our lands and waters.
Canada's Arctic and Northern governments and communities are at the heart of security in the region. Partnership, cooperation and shared leadership are essential to promoting security in this diverse, complex and expansive area. Working in partnership with trusted international allies and all levels of government, including Indigenous communities, organizations and governments, Canada will continue to protect the safety and security of the people in the Arctic and the North, now and into the future.
The Arctic and Northern security environment
There is growing international interest and competition in the Canadian Arctic from state and non-state actors who seek to share in the region's rich natural resources and strategic position. This comes at a time where climate change, combined with advancements in technology, has made access to the region easier. While the Canadian Arctic has historically been — and continues to be — a region of stability and peace, growing competition and increased access brings safety and security challenges to which Canada must be ready to respond.
Climate change and increasing accessibility of the Arctic and Northern regions
Climate change is having far-reaching effects on the lives and well-being of Northerners. Extreme weather events, such as intense storms, wildfires, and floods are occurring more often and with greater severity. These events not only pose an immediate threat to the lives and property of Northerners, but can also impact the security of communities more broadly by severing the crucial transportation and communication links on which Northerners depend. Other climate change effects, including increasingly unpredictable weather patterns, melting permafrost, and changing sea ice conditions, can have an impact on food security, make transportation and travel more difficult, and endanger the stability and functioning of delicate ecosystems.
The remoteness of Arctic and Northern communities also poses a challenge with regard to critical infrastructure (CI) and emergency management (EM) considerations, which are likely to be exacerbated due to climate change. Melting ice could contribute to an increase in search and rescue requirements within the North. As such, monitoring capabilities of ice conditions and icebergs will need to be augmented to support the increased marine traffic through Northern waterways and to proactively limit EM response requests through cohesive mitigation and prevention efforts. CI requirements will increasingly need to consider a changing demographic and environment to ensure continued provision of essential services and capabilities. Specifically, robust CI is required in order to support communications, EM and military capabilities, and safe transportation within the region.
Arctic Maritime traffic
Every year, more ships, including large government research vessels and commercial cargo vessels, navigate Northern waters. In 2017, more than 190 vessels undertook 385 reported voyages through the Canadian Arctic, a 22% increase over 2016
Tourism vessels are also not uncommon in the Canadian Arctic. In 2016, Northerners saw the first transit of a modern, 1000-passenger, foreign-based cruise ship through the entire Northwest Passage.
Although the warming of the Arctic and the North offers economic opportunities, which would bring much needed socio-economic development, employment and infrastructure investments that are acutely lacking in the region, higher levels of activity could bring the potential for damage to unique ecosystems and may also increase the risks associated with increased movement of people and goods, the pursuit of interests by foreign state and non-state actors in Canada's Arctic and northern territory, and human-induced disasters. It is not difficult to imagine, for example, how a naturally-occurring or human-induced disaster in the Arctic Archipelago would place tremendous strain on the capacities of all levels of government, as well as on local communities, to support affected people and minimize the damage to affected wildlife, infrastructure, and ecosystems.
Growing international interest in the Arctic
While Canada sees no immediate threat in the Arctic and the North, as the region's physical environment changes, the circumpolar North is becoming an area of strategic international importance, with both Arctic and non-Arctic states expressing a variety of economic and military interests in the region. As the Arctic becomes more accessible, these states are poised to conduct research, transit through, and engage in more trade in the region. Given the growing international interest and competition in the Arctic, continued security and defence of Canada's Arctic requires effective safety and security frameworks, national defence, and deterrence.
In particular, easier access to the Arctic may contribute to greater foreign presence in Canadian Arctic waterways. On this matter, Canada remains committed to exercising its sovereignty, including in the various waterways commonly referred to as the Northwest Passage.
Similarly, Canada's Arctic and natural resources are attracting interest from foreign states and enterprises. Foreign investment, research, and science have the potential to improve the lives of Northerners. However, some of these investments and related economic activities could seek to advance interests that may be in opposition to those of Canada. Recognizing that economic growth and investment in the Arctic supports good jobs, healthy people and strong communities, there are also security risks associated with these investments that could impact the well-being of Northerners. Canada will continue to balance needed economic development while ensuring that security in the Arctic and the North is maintained.
While the circumpolar Arctic can and should continue to benefit from a deeply ingrained culture of international cooperation, this cooperation must not result in complacency at a time of increased interest and competition from both Arctic and non-Arctic states who see the region's political, economic, scientific, strategic and military potential. In some cases, states with interests in the Arctic are using a broad range of military capabilities and other state-controlled assets as they work to collect intelligence and position themselves to access or control sensitive sites, infrastructure, and strategic resources — potentially under the appearance of productive activities. In addition, rapid changes in military and strategic technologies including remotely-piloted systems, as well as the rise of competition in new domains such as space, artificial intelligence, and cyber, are likely to have a significant impact on the way states pursue their interests, and gives them the ability to project military force in the Arctic and North America. The long-term objectives of some of these states remain unclear, and their interests may not always align with our own.
Canada's interest is to maintain the long-standing peace and stability in the region. While Canada is open to cooperation with other states regarding the Arctic, our security priority will always be the protection of Northerners and our broader national interests against competing interests.
Taken together, the opportunities, challenges, increased competition, and risks created by a more accessible Arctic require a greater presence of security organizations, strengthened emergency management, effective military capability, and improved situational awareness. Meeting these demands necessitates a collaborative approach among all levels of government, as well as with Northerners, including Indigenous peoples, and in cooperation with the private sector where relevant to ensure that the region can prosper and that it continues to be a zone of peace and cooperation.
Goal: The Canadian Arctic and North and its people are safe, secure, and well-defended
One of the primary objectives of the Government of Canada is to protect the safety and security of Northerners and safeguard the ability to defend both the Canadian Arctic and North America now and into the future. To meet this goal the Government of Canada will continue to advance the following objectives:
- Strengthen Canada's cooperation and collaboration with domestic and international partners on safety, security and defence issues
- Enhance Canada's military presence as well as prevent and respond to safety and security incidents in the Arctic and the North
- Strengthen Canada's domain awareness, surveillance, and control capabilities in the Arctic and the North
- Enforce Canada's legislative and regulatory frameworks that govern transportation, border integrity, and environmental protection in the Arctic and the North
- Increase the whole-of-society emergency management capabilities in Arctic and Northern communities
- Support community safety through effective and culturally-appropriate crime prevention initiatives and policing services
This approach is needed to secure Canada's wider interests in the region, and to protect the people and communities who call the Canadian Arctic home.
Objective 1: Strengthen Canada's cooperation and collaboration with domestic and international partners on safety, security and defence issues
The complexity of the Arctic security environment places a premium on collaboration between all levels of government, local and Indigenous communities and peoples, and trusted international partners. Keeping pace with the evolving safety, security, and defence challenges facing the Arctic and its peoples requires improving the ways we work together.
Domestic partnerships
To further our collective ability to operate and respond to the unique safety and security challenges in the Arctic, safety and security organizations at all levels will continue to work together to identify common priorities, synchronize planning, and enhance our interoperability, including in fora such as the Arctic Security Working Group.
Operation NANOOK — Canada's signature domestic Arctic operation — reinforces the Canadian Armed Forces as a key partner in Arctic safety and security. Through Operation NANOOK, the Canadian Armed Forces delivers training, develops partnerships, and helps improve the readiness of federal, territorial, Indigenous, and municipal partners, as well as international partners. The Canadian Armed Forces also shares a number of facilities with local and federal partners, including a state-of-the-art cold-weather training facility in Resolute Bay, Nunavut, and Natural Resources Canada's Polar Continental Shelf Program. Going forward, the Canadian Armed Forces will continue to use Operation NANOOK and shared facilities to foster a collaborative approach to addressing Arctic safety, security, and defence challenges.
Canadian Rangers
Canadian Rangers, a component of the Canadian Armed Forces Reserves, is the Canadian Armed Forces' 'eyes and ears' in the Arctic and in the North. Its primary role is to provide a military presence in those sparsely settled Northern, coastal, and isolated areas of Canada which are not otherwise served by the Canadian Armed Forces.
The Canadian Armed Forces will also continue to deepen its extensive relationships with Indigenous governments, organizations and Northern communities, and will continue to engage with local populations as a routine part of its Arctic operations and exercises. For example, the Canadian Armed Forces will continue to enhance training and the operational effectiveness of the Canadian Rangers so that they can better contribute and respond to safety and security incidents, strengthen domain awareness, and express Canadian sovereignty. The Government of Canada also attaches great value to the Junior Canadian Ranger program, as it provides opportunities for youth in remote Arctic and Northern communities to build and share traditional and other life skills in remote and isolated communities throughout the Arctic and North, and across Canada.
Likewise, Transport Canada, the Canadian Coast Guard, Environment and Climate Change Canada, and the Canadian Hydrographic Service of the Department of Fisheries and Oceans will work with territorial, provincial, and Indigenous governments to build partnerships to collaboratively manage shipping in the Arctic and the North. Together, partners will identify Northern Low-Impact Shipping Corridors, and develop a governance framework to promote safer marine transportation in the North and ensure the provision of essential services to Arctic and Northern communities while respecting the environment.
International cooperation
Just as partnerships at the domestic level are critical to ensuring the safety and security of Canada's Arctic, it is equally important to work with other Arctic states and international partners in the broader region. Through the Arctic Council's Emergency Prevention, Preparedness, and Response Working Group, for instance, a number of federal government departments collaborate with other Arctic states on how best to address natural or human-induced disasters. As a signatory to the Agreement on Cooperation on Aeronautical and Maritime Search and Rescue in the Arctic, Canada is also actively working alongside the other seven Arctic states to strengthen air and maritime search and rescue. Recognizing the shared challenge posed by search and rescue in the Arctic, this agreement, signed in 2011, coordinates international search and rescue coverage and response in the Arctic, and establishes the area of responsibility of each state. This agreement is one of many that Canada is a signatory to, which highlights the continued importance of international cooperation and our ability to comprehensively respond to incidents.
Building on this essential international cooperation, the Canadian Coast Guard is an active participant in the Arctic Coast Guard Forum, an independent, informal, and operationally-driven organization comprised of representatives from all Arctic states. The Forum is intended to foster safe, secure, and environmentally responsible maritime activity in the Arctic, and provide a venue for information sharing and joint exercises on issues including search and rescue and environmental response. Through this unique forum, the Canadian Coast Guard will continue to share best practices and Canadian expertise with its counterparts, while also supporting the broader environmental protection and sustainable development goals of the Arctic Council.
As the Arctic makes up a large portion of the air and maritime approaches to North America, Canada will continue to work in close partnership with the United States to ensure that we remain secure in North America by being positioned to deter and defend against threats to the continent, including from our Northern approaches. The binational North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), and the strong relationships fostered through the Tri-Command structure which includes NORAD, Canadian Joint Operations Command, and United States Northern Command, remain as relevant for continental defence today. Canada remains firmly committed to modernizing NORAD with the United States to meet current and future threats to North America, as outlined in the Joint Statement from President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, in February 2017.
Canada and its Arctic partners share many of the same challenges in the Arctic, which provides an opportunity to leverage each other's efforts in support of our common security. Through fora such as the Arctic Security Forces Roundtable, Canada will continue to work with Arctic and non-Arctic allies and partners to foster information-sharing, improve situational awareness, and enhance operational cooperation on a broad range of Arctic and regional issues.
Canada will also continue to work with the United States and Denmark — our eastern and western neighbours — and explore opportunities to collaborate with fellow NATO member Norway to increase surveillance and monitoring of the broader Arctic region. More broadly, as stated in Strong, Secure, Engaged: Canada's Defence Policy, Canada will seek opportunities to work with allies and partners, including with NATO, in support of our common commitment to security in the Arctic. As part of this commitment, the Canadian Armed Forces will increase its participation in regional multinational exercises and seek opportunities to incorporate key Arctic and non-Arctic allies and partners in joint activities in Canada's Arctic, including Operation NANOOK. Canada will also continue to develop science and technology partnerships with trusted partners in the fields of security and defence.
Objective 2: Enhance Canada's military presence as well as prevent and respond to safety and security incidents in the Arctic and the North
The Canadian Armed Forces
The Government of Canada is already taking steps to increase its Arctic and Northern footprint in support of regional safety and security. This effort is anchored in Canada's defence policy, Strong, Secure, Engaged, whichrecognizes that the Arctic region is of critical importance to the national security and defence of Canada and of North America. Strong, Secure, Engaged meets the need to enhance the Canadian Armed Forces' presence in the region over the long term by setting out the capability investments that will give the Canadian Armed Forces the mobility, reach, and footprint required to project force in the region in ways that defend our national interests and sovereignty, and better respond to the needs of those residing in Arctic and Northern communities. Strong, Secure, Engaged, committed a number of key investments in the Arctic and the North, including six ice-capable Arctic Offshore Patrol Vessels, which are a part of the National Shipbuilding Strategy, all-terrain vehicles optimized for use in the Arctic environment, and space situational awareness to enhance and improve communications throughout Canada's Arctic region. These initiatives and investments are a small sampling of the various activities being carried out by the Canadian Armed Forces to defend Canada's Arctic and North. A comprehensive account of all Canadian Armed Force's activities in the Arctic can be found in Canada's defence policy Strong, Secure, Engaged.
Adapting to the evolving security environment will require a multi-pronged effort. At the operational level, the Canadian Armed Forces will continue to build and maintain its ability to respond in the Arctic through support for annual operations and exercises, including through a new approach to Operation NANOOK which encompasses a range of activities conducted over the course of the year. This will ensure that the Canadian Armed Forces is better able to demonstrate a persistent presence in the Arctic, support whole-of-government partners in delivering on their mandates in the Arctic, enhance our capacity to respond to major incidents, and increase collaboration with international Arctic Allies and partners.
By undertaking an approach to long-term planning that ensures the appropriate development of Arctic safety, security, and defence capability and infrastructure, we will be able to maintain a persistent and effective capacity to respond to incidents in the Arctic and to project and sustain force for domestic and continental defence into the future.
The Canadian Coast Guard
The Canadian Coast Guard is often the only federal presence in many areas of the Arctic and must have the capacity to protect Canada's interests in the region. Through the strategic positioning of resources and assets, targeted investments in infrastructure and the adoption of advanced vessel technology, the Canadian Coast Guard is enhancing its capacity to support Canada's safety, security, environmental, and economic interests in Northern waters.
The Canadian Coast Guard already provides ice-capable platforms to support responses to maritime safety, security, and environmental threats, and often partners with other departments, agencies, and organizations as they carry out their respective mandates. Through the Government of Canada's Oceans Protection Plan, the Canadian Coast Guard has extended its icebreaking season in the Arctic to ensure safe marine shipping and promote economic growth. As part of this effort, the Coast Guard has acquired 3 interim medium icebreakers, which will be operational in 2020–21, while additional vessels will be built under the National Shipbuilding Strategy.
Transport Canada
Transport Canada plays an important role in the Arctic through its National Aerial Surveillance Program, and is a key contributor in protecting Canada's interests in the region. With the investment of new infrastructure in the Arctic (a new Arctic hangar and accommodations unit), Transport Canada will continue to support Canada's safety, security, environmental, and economic interests in Northern waters. Transport Canada currently provides aircraft to monitor shipping activities, ice conditions and marine security, including environmental threats. Transport Canada also shares information with other departments, agencies, and organizations as they carry out their respective mandates.
Transport Canada continues to work on the remotely piloted aircraft system (RPAS) project as a means of enhancing its airborne maritime monitoring and other capabilities. The RPAS is expected to supplement manned aircraft already patrolling the Arctic.
Advancing Arctic search and rescue
Arctic search and rescue
Search and rescue (SAR) in the Arctic is an immense and complex activity that requires a broad range of capabilities and partners working together to save lives.
- Air search and rescue is conducted by the Royal Canadian Air Force, with assistance from the Civil Air Search and Rescue Association, a national volunteer organization which provides private aircraft and trained crews. In addition, the Canadian Armed Forces is responsible for the effective operation of the coordinated aeronautical and maritime SAR system through Joint Rescue Coordination Centres. Finally, the Canadian Armed Forces also provides and coordinates the Air response for maritime SAR
- Due to its continuous monitoring of the Arctic and presence in the region, Transport Canada plays a key role in SAR. Its surveillance aircraft is often the first asset to be called upon to respond to incidents
- Maritime search and rescue is mandated to the Canadian Coast Guard, and supported by the Canadian Coast Guard Auxiliary, a volunteer organization with more than 200 members and 25 vessels.
- Ground search and rescue is a collaborative effort between territorial and provincial governments and agencies, and the federal government. It is most often coordinated by the jurisdictional police service, and can involve collaboration with the Royal Canadian Air Force or the Canadian Rangers of the Canadian Armed Forces.
- Public Safety Canada is leading the development of a strategic policy framework for Canada's search and rescue community to ensure integrated governance across all regions of Canada, including the Arctic
The Canadian Coast Guard is increasing its maritime search and rescue capacity in the North in partnership with Indigenous communities. Through the Oceans Protection Plan, it is expanding the Arctic Canadian Coast Guard Auxiliary and extending its Indigenous Community Boat Volunteer Pilot Program. These measures will complement the recent creation of the first Arctic Inshore Rescue Boat station in Rankin Inlet, which will allow the Canadian Coast Guard to more effectively respond to marine emergencies. Finally, through the community boats program, Cambridge Bay, Rankin Inlet, Gjoa Haven, and Ulukhaktok will receive funding to purchase search and rescue boats and equipment. The Canadian Coast Guard will continue to undertake risk assessments in coastal Arctic communities to ensure that maritime search and rescue needs can be met, now and into the future.
In support of one of its core missions, the Canadian Armed Forces is investing in a replacement for the Fixed-Wing Search and Rescue aircraft which will bolster the Royal Canadian Air Force's ability to respond to critical air search and rescue, in partnership with civilian partners. The Canadian Armed Forces also continues to build its ability to respond in the Arctic and the North through the conduct of operations and exercises, including refinement and exercising of Exercise READY SOTERIA, which corresponds to the scenario of a Major Air Disaster. With the acquisition of a fleet of Arctic and Offshore Patrol Vessels, the Royal Canadian Navy will be better positioned to support partners, including the Canadian Coast Guard, in undertaking Arctic activities.
Finally, recognizing that a better understanding of activity in the Arctic is critical to search and rescue abilities, Public Safety Canada will continue to work with search and rescue partners, including Northern communities and peoples, to encourage the use of standardized location devices and technologies to ensure that responders are able to receive distress signals across a common frequency.
Border security
Another important element in addressing the evolving safety and security realities in the Arctic is to ensure the integrity of our Northern borders and facilitate legitimate travel. To this end, the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) will run pilot programs in the Arctic, including Private Vessel Remote Clearance, to support the clearance process for certain non-commercial pleasure craft seeking to enter Canada in the eastern regions of the Arctic. It will also launch the Arctic Shipping Electronic Commercial Clearance Pilot, which is an alternate clearance process for commercial vessels.
As Canada's lead for border management and border enforcement, the CBSA will work with a wide range of partners to co-develop and co-implement timely, relevant and sustainable services at an increasing number of points of service (e.g. deep water ports, airports, marine vessel transits) in a dynamic risk environment. Although CBSA is responsible for managing border security at specified ports of entry, the RCMP is responsible for securing Canada's borders between those ports and is the designated body for enforcing immigration and customs legislation in the North when and where there is an absence of other enforcement bodies.
Objective 3: Strengthen Canada's domain awareness, surveillance, and control capabilities in the Arctic and the North
Made up of more than 162,000 km of coastline, and comprising 75% of Canada's overall coastline and 40% of Canada's landmass, the Canadian Arctic poses unique challenges for building and maintaining a comprehensive picture of what is happening across this vast domain. Our ability to respond to regional challenges, provide security, and enforce compliance with our laws and regulations largely depends on our ability to put this picture together, as gaps can have life-threatening consequences. For example, increased maritime and cross-border traffic creates new challenges for border enforcement and effective vessel tracking. This is why it is critical for departments, agencies, communities and others to work together to develop strong domain awareness by collecting and synthesizing information from multiple sources.
Addressing critical gaps in situational awareness across the vast expanses of Canada's Arctic and North, and ensuring service levels are commensurate with growing demands, will also be essential to support missions-critical decision-making and strategic planning in the region. In particular, many safety, security and defence efforts in the Arctic and the North are reliant on sound weather, water, ice, and climate information, alerting and warning services to help mitigate operational risks.
Marine Security Operations Centres
The Marine Security Operations Centres provide Canada with a marine security capability by identifying, assessing, and reporting on maritime activities, including in the Arctic, that represent a potential threat to the sovereignty, safety, and security of Canada and Canadians. Comprised of several federal departments and agencies responsible for marine security, the Marine Security Operation Centres enable partners to work together, share intelligence and surveillance information, and support an organized response.
Several federal partners, including the Department of National Defence and the Canadian Armed Forces, the Department of Fisheries and Oceans and the Canadian Coast Guard, Transport Canada, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Canada Border Services Agency, Environment and Climate Change Canada, and Natural Resources Canada provide the infrastructure and work together to monitor activity in the Arctic, including through Marine Security Operations Centres. These Centres are an integral component of Canada's maritime intelligence and security architecture and contribute to a whole-of-government approach to increase maritime domain awareness. These centers monitor, detect, and analyze vessel traffic and identify security-related incidents that require a response by the Government of Canada. We will also strive, in collaboration with Indigenous governments, associations, and organizations, to increase the participation of Northern and Indigenous communities in the maritime management regime. This collaboration will enhance our knowledge of vessel activities in areas of cultural and environmental importance, as well as in areas of significance to national security.
Recognizing the need to develop a clearer understanding of the region, the Government of Canada will bring together the capabilities of a broad range of assets, such as satellites, to help provide security providers and decision-makers with a clear comprehensive picture of the operating environment.
To effectively monitor and control all of Canada's territory and approaches, Canada has taken steps to increase its awareness of air traffic approaching and operating in Canada's sovereign airspace in the Arctic, including through expansion of the Canadian Air Defence Identification Zone (CADIZ) to cover the entirety of Canada's Arctic Archipelago and its approaches. Bolstering our capabilities to support continental defence in partnership with the United States, including through the modernization of NORAD and the renewal of the North Warning System, will be essential to our continued ability to detect and understand threats against North America, and to decide whether and how to respond.
As outlined in Strong, Secure, Engaged the Canadian Armed Forces will further strengthen its ability to monitor activity in the Arctic by acquiring a range of new sea, land, air, and space capabilities and integrating them into a 'system-of-systems' approach to Arctic surveillance. The Royal Canadian Air Force will acquire a fleet of 88 advanced fighter aircraft to enforce Canada's sovereignty and meet Canada's commitments to NORAD and NATO. Canada will also continue working collaboratively with NORAD to ensure that it has the capabilities and structures, including command and control, for continuous aerospace and maritime domain awareness as well as aerospace control. As new areas of potential threat are identified — including developing technologies such as remotely-piloted systems and the emergence of new space and cyber capabilities — acquiring assets such as the replacement for the upcoming RADARSAT Constellation Mission system will enhance and improve surveillance and monitoring, including throughout Canada's Arctic region. The Canadian Armed Forces will also introduce a number of Arctic Offshore Patrol Vessels, which provide armed, sea-borne surveillance of Canadian waters in the Arctic.
Advanced research and development, including through the All Domain Situational Awareness Science and Technology (S&T) Program, and the Innovation for Defence Excellence and Security (IDEaS) program, will further contribute to meeting the Canadian Armed Forces' need for cutting-edge surveillance and communication solutions designed for the challenging Arctic environment. Safeguarding investments made in these essential technologies from unfriendly foreign activities such as theft and sabotage is a priority for Canada.
Objective 4: Enforce Canada's legislative and regulatory frameworks in the Arctic and North
Transportation in Canadian Arctic waters is subject to robust legislative and regulatory frameworks designed to protect both people and the environment. Given the rise of maritime traffic in the Arctic, ensuring the proper regulation of vessels transiting through or operating in our waters is a growing priority for Canada. In this context, a number of legislative mechanisms regulate shipping, including: the Marine Transportation Security Act; the Canada Shipping Act, 2001; the Marine Liability Act; and the Arctic Waters Pollution Prevention Act. All three provide a range of recourse to address risks associated with safety and security in the region. Another important development is the 2017 introduction of the Arctic Shipping Safety and Pollution Prevention Regulations which address ship safety and pollution prevention, incorporate the Polar Code, and represent the most significant change to Canada's Arctic shipping regime in a decade. As the operating environment evolves, the Government of Canada will continue to enforce our laws and regulations to ensure safe, secure, and environmentally sound vessel operations, and to stop unsafe vessels from operating in the Arctic.
Additionally, the Northern Canada Vessel Traffic Services Zone Regulations (NORDREG) help track vessels operating in Canadian waters to ensure safe and efficient navigation and protection of the marine environment. With expanding tourism and cruise ship activity in the region, including possible stops in Northern communities, Transport Canada will continue to work with Arctic communities to bring their marine infrastructure into compliance with the Marine Transportation Security Act and other regulations. The Government of Canada will ensure that our legislative and regulatory frameworks remain adapted to the realities of increasing levels of Arctic traffic, and the potential impacts on the region's people and communities.
Effective laws and regulations are also key in ensuring that foreign investment in the Arctic benefits Northerners and does not pose a threat to Canada's security. This legal and regulatory framework supports economic growth and increased investments in the regions, while ensuring that foreign economic activity in the Arctic does not compromise national security. While we look to develop much-needed infrastructure in the Arctic, risks and opportunities posed by foreign activity in areas of strategic importance will need to be carefully considered and balanced. Knowing that safe and sustainable communities free from potentially damaging external influence or behaviours are the foundation of a healthy Northern economy, the Government of Canada will also enhance protections for sensitive sites and infrastructures, as well as for the technologies on which the Canadian Armed Forces and other federal security providers depend.
Objective 5: Increase whole-of-society emergency management capabilities in Arctic and Northern communities
A key pillar of the Arctic safety and security architecture is incorporated in Canada's Emergency Management Strategy, which is the result of federal, provincial, and territorial efforts to establish complementary approaches to emergency management. Recognizing that emergency requirements are constantly changing, there is a need for collaboration amongst all areas of society to enhance community safety and resilience. As part of ongoing efforts to improve the way we prevent, mitigate, prepare for, respond to, and recover from emergencies, partners are working to strengthen federal, provincial and territorial Emergency Management governance and enhance the participation of Indigenous representatives in this work.
Objective 6: Support community safety through effective and culturally-appropriate crime prevention initiatives and policing services
As Arctic and Northern communities continue to face particular challenges that contribute to higher levels of crime, culturally-sensitive crime prevention programs and community safety planning initiatives are essential. Through the Aboriginal Community Safety Planning Initiative, Public Safety Canada will continue to support Indigenous and Northern communities to develop community safety plans that address issues identified by the community, as specific to their unique vulnerabilities and circumstances. In addition, the National Crime Prevention Strategy will continue to deliver culturally-sensitive crime prevention programming and support initiatives to prevent and reduce crime in Indigenous and Northern communities. Through funding programs such as the Northern and Aboriginal Crime Prevention Fund and the Crime Prevention Action Fund, the Government of Canada will continue to collaborate with its partners to support and promote safe, strong, and resilient communities. The Gun and Gang Violence Action Fund was also developed with the recognition that provinces and territories — working closely with Arctic and Northern communities — are best placed to identify their most pressing issues related to gun and gang violence and develop initiatives to address them. As such, this Fund allows jurisdictions the flexibility to use these resources for a range of enforcement and prevention-related activities, including tailored initiatives that are adapted to Arctic and Northern realities.
The RCMP also has a key role in securing Canada's Arctic by providing policing services. Increasing international interest and activity in the Arctic could lead to escalating organized crime activity, irregular migration, human smuggling, and national security threats. To help respond, through Territorial Police Service Agreements, there is a large RCMP presence in the Northern Territories to help protect Arctic and Northern communities and ensure the safety of Northerners. The RCMP's presence in the Arctic includes 61 detachments and 3 Divisional headquarters. As the contracted police service, RCMP plays a critical role in providing first response to civil emergencies and national security threats.
As more commercial ventures, such as the Iqaluit deep water port, and people become established in the region, the demand for illicit goods is likely to increase. Higher profit margins for drugs in the Arctic, compared to in southern provinces, have attracted criminal networks. The RCMP's primary priority across the northern territories is to maintain safe and secure communities. The RCMP conducts traditional boots-on-the-ground policing, while focusing on delivering the highest quality service, which includes developing community capacity to prevent crime through social development initiatives and criminal intelligence collection. Criminal intelligence serves to assist the RCMP in preventing, deterring, and detecting criminal activity that may pose a threat to the safety and security of Canada.

While increasing carbon dioxide levels are the dominant factor contributing to climate change in the Arctic, short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs) also play a significant role. Targeting SLCPs by reducing black carbon and methane emissions will help to slow Arctic warming in the near term.
The importance of reducing black carbon was emphasized at a Ministerial meeting of the Arctic Council in Iqaluit, Nunavut, Canada on 24 April 2015, in which UNECE participated as an observer. Arctic Council Member States are Canada, Denmark (including Greenland and the Faroe Islands), Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russian Federation, Sweden, and the United States of America— all of which are UNECE members.
As black carbon emitted both within and outside of the Arctic region contributes to Arctic warming, reducing transboundary air pollution is critical. UNECE therefore invited the Arctic Council to explore opportunities for closer cooperation with its Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution (CLRTAP) in order to reduce black carbon emissions. In particular, synergies could be found with the work under the newly revised Protocol to Abate Acidification, Eutrophication and Ground-level Ozone (Gothenburg Protocol), which now also encompasses emission reduction commitments for fine particulate matter (PM2.5) including black carbon. Already, in accordance with a decision by Arctic Environment Ministers in 2013, Arctic Council States and other Parties to CLRTAP have, for the first time, submitted national emission inventories for black carbon, which will assist in identifying emission trends and mitigation opportunities.
Foreign ministers at the Arctic Council meeting acknowledged the contribution of UNECE to the work of the Council. Working with the United States Chairmanship, other Arctic States and relevant programmes and bodies under them and CLRTAP, UNECE will further explore strengthened collaboration in the coming months.

In spring, a persistent heatwave over Siberia provoked the rapid melting of sea ice in the East Siberian and Laptev Seas. By the end of summer, Arctic Ocean ice cover melted back to the second-lowest minimum extent on record. In autumn, the annual freeze-up of sea ice got off to a late and sluggish start.
But any single month, season, or even year, is just a snapshot in time. The long view is more telling, and it is troubling.
Forty years of satellite data show that 2020 was just the latest in a decades-long decline of Arctic sea ice. In a review of scientific literature, polar scientists Julienne Stroeve and Dirk Notz outlined some of these changes: In addition to shrinking ice cover, melting seasons are getting longer and sea ice is losing its longevity.
The longer melting seasons are the result of increasingly earlier starts to spring melting and ever-later starts to freeze-up in autumn. The map above shows trends in the onset of freeze-up from 1979 through 2019. Averaged across the entire Arctic Ocean, freeze-up is happening about a week later per decade. That equates to nearly one month later since the start of the satellite record in 1979.
The change is part of a cycle called the “ice-albedo feedback.” Open ocean water absorbs 90 percent of the Sun’s energy that falls on it; bright sea ice reflects 80 percent of it. With greater areas of the Arctic Ocean exposed to solar energy early in the season, more heat can be absorbed—a pattern that reinforces melting. Until that heat escapes to the atmosphere, sea ice cannot not regrow.
The chart above demonstrates another way the Arctic is changing: the average age of sea ice is becoming younger. At the start of the satellite record, much of the ice covering the Arctic Ocean was greater than four years old. Today, most of the ice covering the Arctic Ocean is “first-year ice” —ice that forms in winter and does not survive a single summer melt season. (After sea ice reaches its minimum extent each September, the remaining ice graduates to second-year status.)
Dominated by thin first-year ice, along with some older ice thinned by warm ocean water, the Arctic sea ice pack is becoming more fragile. In summer 2020, ships easily navigated the Northern Sea Route in ice-free waters, and even made it to the North Pole without much resistance.
Fortunately, summers are still not entirely ice-free. “We’ve been hovering for some time around 4 million square kilometers of Arctic sea ice each summer,” said Stroeve, a researcher at University of Manitoba. She added that she intends to examine which conditions and processes could push sea ice to the next “precipitous drop”—when the extent of summer ice cover drops to a new benchmark of 3 million square kilometers.

By mid-century, a Transpolar Passage will open across the Arctic Ocean via the North Pole. Few countries are preparing for this reality except China.
I recently attended (via teleconference, to cut down on travel time and emissions!) a meeting on future maritime trade flows at the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)’s International Transport Forum. One session focused exclusively on the Northern Sea Route, the shipping route along Russia’s north coast that has sat at the center of discussions on Arctic development for the better part of two decades now.
Due to Chatham House rules, I can’t quote anyone who spoke in the workshop. I can say, however, that during the session, it quickly became clear that talk of the Northern Sea Route’s potential was starting to seem passé in the face of rapid climate change in the Arctic. The shrinking and thinning of sea ice is happening faster than scientists thought possible – so fast that now, it’s not just the Northern Sea Route or even the Northwest Passage that people are talking about. They’re talking about a trans-Arctic passage cutting straight across the North Pole.
As climate change accelerates and the Arctic Ocean reluctantly exchanges its year-round ice cap for merely seasonal cover, a transpolar passage is likely to open up by mid-century, if not sooner. If Arctic sea ice disappears even for just one summer, as the comprehensive 2009 Arctic Marine Shipping Assessment notes (p. 34), this would spell “the disappearance of multi-year sea ice in the central Arctic Ocean. Such an occurrence would have significant implications for design, construction and operational standards of all future Arctic marine activities.” In the absence of thick multi-year ice, which can be up to five meters deep, any water that refreezes would take the form of much thinner, more navigable seasonable ice.
In other words, forget needing nuclear icebreakers. Within the next few decades, in summer, it may be possible (even if insurance companies and the Polar Code still mandate polar-class, ice-resistant ships) to sail in a regular vessel across the top of the Earth.
Icebreakers: a short-lived technology?

It was not until 1977 that the first surface vessel reached the North Pole. That ship was Arktika, a Soviet nuclear icebreaker which chugged to 90 degrees north from the industrial city of Murmansk. At that time, the Central Arctic Ocean was still in a deep freeze. Scientific papers such as the 1973 Journal of Glaciologyarticle from which the figure below is taken describe how near the North Pole, “only 0.2% of the area was ice-free.” Such writing now reads like pre- rather than post-apocalyptic science fiction, chronicling once-upon-a-time worlds rather than worlds that might one day be.
An excerpt from “The mass balance of the sea ice of the Arctic Ocean,” an article published in Journal of Glaciology in 1973.
It is both remarkable and terrifying to think that just ten or twenty years from now – and just some six or seven decades after Arktika’s historic voyage – ice-strengthened and perhaps even conventional ships may be able to reach the top of the planet. It is also astonishing that as recently as 2007, people were still talking about the “viability of transarctic nuclear shipping,” as the department head of the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy suggested at a conference in Akureyri that year [2]. He was contemplating using nuclear ships to mitigate emissions depositing soot onto the ice cap that, by darkening it, would accelerate warming. But for better or worse, once the Arctic’s sea ice is gone, the additional climactic consequences of turning what was once white black will be a moot point.
Arktika’s trip to the North Pole was deliberately timed to coincide with the sixtieth anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution. Ominously, it may also coincide with sixty years before the time when ships could sail directly across an ice-free North Pole. By one estimate, when the Arctic becomes ice-free – and this is almost surely to happen within the next few decades, if only in summer – this will mark the first time in 2.6 million years that the Arctic Ocean has lacked any sea cover.
At the stage when all the ice disappears, icebreaking will become a technology that, invented in its modern variant in 1897, was only really necessary for 150 to 200 years. Like the zeppelin and the Concorde before it, icebreakers will become a futuristic technology lost to history. Their early demise won’t be due to technological or financial failures, however, but rather because humankind made the surfaces it traversed obsolete
The case for shipping via the North Pole
In a world where timeliness means the difference between loss and profit, the Transpolar Passage could prove enticing, just as the Northern Sea Route and Northwest Passage do. For journeys between Europe and Asia, the Northern Sea Route can already be two to three weeks faster than the Suez Canal. By cutting straight across the Arctic, the Transpolar Passage could save a further two days [1]. It might even make sailing through Arctic straits (the Northern Sea Route and Northwest Passage) “obsolete,” as one book suggests.
Fast shipping isn’t everything, of course. Besides time, shipowners also consider risks and costs, and polar shipping still is a more dangerous and pricier undertaking due to the advanced types of ships required, insurance costs, and icebreaker escort fees. Most shipping these days also follows the pendulum model, with vessels stopping at ports between their origin and destination to make deliveries. This logistics chain requires markets, of which there are obviously none in the middle of the Arctic Ocean.
Developing the Transpolar Passage might therefore necessitate some creative rejiggering of the global shipping system. Mikaa Mered, professor of Arctic and Antarctic politics at the ILERI School of International Relations in France, and Adeline Descamps, editor-in-chief of the Journal de la Marine Marchande, have referred to this as a “reversed hub and spoke system.” Ports situated at the Arctic Ocean’s Atlantic and Pacific gateways, like Dutch Harbor, Alaska, which already sees thousands of ships a year pass between North America and Asia, could become hubs for the Transpolar Passage. Cargo could be fast-tracked between Europe and Asia and North America via polar-class shuttles sailing across the Arctic Ocean. These ships also wouldn’t have size restrictions, as the Central Arctic Ocean’s bathymetry isn’t as limiting as the Northern Sea Route or Northwest Passage. Once out of the Arctic Ocean, cargo could be transshipped from places like Dutch Harbor to ports along the North Pacific, or, on the other side, from a place like Iceland to ports along the North Atlantic.
Mered admitted over email, “I know that all of this may sound far-fetched.” But since he first heard the concept discussed at a closed-door Arctic business meeting in northern Norway, he has seen Chinese, South Korean, Icelandic, Alaskan, Russian and Norwegian stakeholders talking about it in greater and greater detail. Alluding to talk of investments in shipbuilding research and design, research taking place already within the Arctic, and infrastructure development, Mered concluded, “I don’t see now why this model wouldn’t emerge by 2050.”
These gateway areas, however – especially around the Bering Sea, where subsistence hunting and fishing is still a vibrant and critical practice – are also where the negative impacts of increased shipping may be felt. Along the Bering Strait, where the Northern Sea Route, Northwest Passage, and Transpolar Passage all meet, people living in communities such as Nome, Teller, or Dutch Harbor, Alaska could all potentially see more ships passing by, and maybe docking, by mid-century. For them, though, this activity may not herald the start of a great new gilded age of connectivity and globalization. The appearance of open water will drastically undermine food security and permanently alter a way of life that has relied on ice and the beluga whales, walruses, and seals that flock to it for generations. To counteract these losses, in a 2014 workshop called “Bering Strait Voices on Arctic Shipping,” one participant suggested that the ships that are already docking could pay into a fund that contributes to protecting food security. Yet while money might bring more food into Bering Strait communities, it can’t bring back the ice.
While more ships may soon sail through the Bering Strait, the age-old practice of hunting walrus on the ice may come to an end this century.
China prepares for an ice-free Arctic Ocean
While most of the world buries its collective head in the sand when it comes to climate change, there is one country that is preparing – paradoxically, somehow both ominously and optimistically – for a future that is several degrees hotter: China. The world’s largest nation sees a planet that is inevitably getting much, much warmer. Even if the planet were to stop emitting all greenhouse gases today, those that already have been emitted into the atmosphere will still induce warming effects for years to come. Since we don’t appear to be doing much to limit our emissions, we are headed for a warmer world – one where the Arctic ice cap may be gone in summer by 2050, and possibly even sooner.
The only country that seems to be ready for that reality is China. In its Arctic Policy, released in January 2018, China calls the trans-Arctic passage the “Central Passage.” It is not referenced in any dramatic way. In that matter-of-fact, this-is-how-the-world-is tone characteristic of Chinese policy documents, the policy notes, “The Arctic shipping routes comprise the Northeast Passage, Northwest Passage, and the Central Passage.” The strategy also mentions the Polar Silk Road, which is often viewed as synonymous with the Northern Sea Route. But keep in mind that the strategy notes that by cooperating with other stakeholders, China aims to “build a ‘Polar Silk Road’ through developing the Arctic shipping routes” – plural likely intentional.
Mered, the ILERI professor, described:
“When we talk about the ‘Polar Silk Road,’ we’re talking about a two-step idea. At first, shipping through the Northeast Passage, with all the limits we know. And then, when market and ice conditions show the model is viable, shipping through the Central Arctic Passage with the shuttle system.”
Meanwhile, other countries’ policies fail to mention any variants of the “Central Passage.” Norway’s Arctic Strategy, updated in 2017, doesn’t include the trans-Arctic passage in the full-length Norwegian version or in the shorter English summary. The former merely indicates (in Norwegian), “As ice conditions change, both the Northeast Passage and the Northwest Passage will be relevant for transport between markets in the Atlantic and the Pacific.”
Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy only references the Northwest Passage. South Korea – an Asian trading nation with Arctic shipping interests – also describes only the Northern Sea Route in its Arctic Policy.
Iceland’s Arctic Policy, dating back to 2011, also fails to mention the Transpolar Passage. The country, however, which might have served as a sort of shipping hub for Viking voyages around the North Atlantic a thousand years ago [3], may be one place where the route has some resonance. In April, a contract was signed Icelandic stakeholders and German port operator Bremenports to begin construction on a deepwater transshipment port Finnafjörður, a harbor in northeast Iceland, that would service vessels “crossing the North Pole capturing the Asia-Europe route,” as this promotional material (PDF) states. The German company is not Iceland’s only investor, for farsighted China also appreciates the North Atlantic island’s geostrategic potential, as Malte Humpert and Andreas Raspotnik noted in their 2012 article on the Transpolar Sea Route. China and Iceland signed a free trade agreement in 2013, and last year, the China-Iceland Arctic Science Observatory opened outside Akureyri.
Finally, in the so-called “reluctant Arctic state” where less than a fifth of people surveyed know that the country has people and territory in the Arctic, the U.S., a new Arctic defense strategy is still in the works. In the meantime, a March 2019 Congressional Research Service report entitled “Changes in the Arctic: Background and Issues for Congress,” may give some insight into how the region’s shipping potential is perceived in Washington, D.C. The document acknowledges only two routes in its section on commercial sea transportation: the Northern Sea Route and the Northwest Passage. It opens with the typical statement about how Western explorers have sought a shortcut from the Atlantic to Asia for five centuries. Little do they seem to realize, however, that Eastern explorers are now seeking that same shortcut, but right across the North Pole rather than around any continent.
Underscoring the outdated thinking, the report recognizes that since some experts predict that the Arctic will be ice-free in late summer by the 2030s, “this opens opportunities for transport through the Northwest Passage and the Northern Sea Route.” Rather inexplicably, the map included is from 2008 – a year when there were 2.34 million more square kilometers of sea ice in October than there were in 2018 [4]. Not only is the figure over a decade old: it represents a time when there were only two conceivable Arctic Ocean routes rather than three.
The nearly 11-year old figure of Arctic shipping inexplicably included in the March 2019 Congressional Research Service report entitled “Changes in the Arctic: Background and Issues for Congress.”
How exactly would that figure look if it were updated? With Community Earth System Models (CESM) data kindly processed and provided by Scott Stephenson, a geographer at the University of Connecticut and Arctic shipping expert, I was able to mock up a few visualizations of how this would look. Scott has done fantastic work showing that new trans-Arctic shipping routes would be navigable by the middle of this century.
Sea ice concentration in these figures is based on the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5, as that is the situation for which we are most likely headed based on current emission levels. This would result in a world that is close to an average 4.9 degrees Celsius hotter by the century’s end – not the 2 degrees that the Paris Agreement is aiming for. For the purposes of the visualization, I noted that the Transpolar Passage was “open” when there was a clear route across the North Pole – yet sailing even outside these years may be possible, to, provided the ice is thin enough.
The inevitability of a Transpolar Passage
One might argue that China’s efforts to drum up the Transpolar Passage is a form of geopolitical posturing. Unlike the Northeast and Northwest Passages, the Transpolar Passage would run mostly through the high seas, where all countries have freedom of navigation, rather than through any waters that could be claimed as internal. China would not be beholden to any government’s regulations when sailing there.
More than just an act of geopolitical bravado, however, China may also be trying to establish first-mover advantage in the Transpolar Passage because the climate science makes clear that a seasonally ice-free Arctic is nearly inevitable.
If there is to be a whole new blue ocean within our lifetimes, the real mystery is why other countries aren’t also preparing for an Arctic waterworld. Doing so would mean that rather than only focusing on building icebreakers for the near-term (which China is also doing), serious thought is also given to issues like safety at sea when ships are sailing past the remote North Pole and how to maintain the food security of communities in places like the Bering Strait.
While some might be excited about the possibility of sailing across a new watery passage, merchant marines of the late 21st and 22nd centuries will not be able to write, as James Cook poetically did in 1778, of being “close to the edge of the ice, which was as compact as a wall, and seemed to be ten or twelve feet high at least.” They may describe blue waves and white caps, but ice will be a distant memory, save for perhaps a few holdouts on Greenland’s rugged north shore. Sailing in an ice-free summer also won’t even deliver the joys of watching the aurora due to the 24-hour daylight. Sailor logbooks that recount the color of the aurora over the open ocean at the North Pole will have to wait until voyages during ice-free winters are possible. But those, too, will one day arrive.
A vanishing sight: Perilous Position of HMS ‘Terror’, Captain Back, in the Arctic Regions in the Summer of 1837, by William Smyth R.N. HMS Terror and her sister ship, HMS Erebus, later infamously became entrapped in ice in the Northwest Passage with their entire crews perishing.

The extreme Arctic climate makes the region a forbidding place to travel and a challenging place to live. Even so, people have found ways to explore and live in the Arctic. Indigenous peoples have lived in the Arctic for thousands of years. Explorers, adventurers, and researchers have also ventured into the Arctic to explore its unique environment and geography.
In the winter, cold Arctic temperatures and extreme wind chills make it dangerous to venture outdoors without proper clothing and gear. Strong storms can make travel difficult. And heating a home can be challenging and expensive without trees to cut for firewood. However, people have found ways to adapt, survive, and thrive in the Arctic.
Indigenous People

Residents of the Arctic include a number of indigenous groups as well as more recent arrivals from more southern latitudes. In total, only about 4 million people live in the Arctic worldwide, and in most countries indigenous people make up a minority of the Arctic population.
Archaeologists and anthropologists now believe that people have lived in the Arctic for as much as twenty thousand years. The Inuit in Canada and Greenland, and the Yu'pik, Iñupiat, and Athabascan in Alaska, are just a few of the groups that are native to the Arctic. Traditionally, Arctic native peoples lived primarily from hunting, fishing, herding, and gathering wild plants for food, although some people also practice farming, particularly in Greenland. Northern people found many different ways to adapt to the harsh Arctic climate, developing warm dwellings and clothing to protect them from frigid weather. They also learned how to predict the weather and navigate in boats and on sea ice. Many Arctic people now live much like their neighbors to the south, with modern homes and appliances. Nonetheless, there is an active movement among indigenous people in the Arctic to pass on traditional knowledge and skills, such as hunting, fishing, herding, and native languages, to the younger generation.
Arctic Exploration
Dogs provided companionship and entertainment for people exploring the Arctic. They also alerted the camp when polar bears were present. Here, dogs are approaching a polar bear as it emerges from a lead (crack) in the ice. Dogs chase the polar bear, ensuring that it does not approach the camp.

Compared to indigenous people who have lived in the Arctic for thousands of years, European explorers are relative newcomers. Europeans started venturing north into Arctic regions of Scandinavia and Russia only around a thousand years ago, with much exploration taking place in the 18th and 19th centuries.
Vikings from Scandinavia traveled to Greenland around A.D. 930, during an unusually mild period throughout most of the Northern Hemisphere. They settled for a time along the south and southwest coasts, the only habitable part of Greenland. For nearly five centuries the Norse settlements persevered, depending on their cattle, sheep and goats, as well as on seal and caribou hunts.
Contacts between the Norse settlements and the outside world ceased in the late 1400s. We now know that as the weather got steadily colder and the pasture and farming lands shrank under the advancing ice and snow, the inhabitants suffered a painful annihilation. The rapid cooling that signaled the beginning of the Little Ice Age in the early 1300s caused sea ice to expand over the North Atlantic, which made it impossible to navigate between Greenland and Iceland, trapping people in their settlements and halting trade.
Russians began exploring the northern regions of their country in the 11th and 12th centuries, and by the 17th century they had explored many Arctic islands. During the 1800's, many explorers searched for a Northwest Passage. Irish explorer, Sir Robert McClure, is credited with finding it in 1851. The first reported person to reach the North Pole is American explorer, Robert Edwin Peary. He accomplished this in 1909, however there are some doubts as to whether he actually made it or not.
People in the Modern Arctic
Many people in the Arctic today live in modern towns and cities, much like their neighbors to the south. People also work in the Arctic, extracting oil and gas from rich deposits beneath the permafrost, working in tourism, or conducting research. Other people in the arctic still live in small villages much the way their ancestors did.
Arctic people today face many changes to their homes and environment. Climate change is causing sea ice to melt and permafrost to thaw, threatening coastal villages with bigger storms and erosion. And the declining sea ice means that the Arctic Ocean could open up for commercial shipping or tourist cruises.

We believe that by understanding the past, we all have the opportunity to define the future. No one brings the past to life like the British Museum, whose permanent collection is one of the finest in existence, spanning two million years of human history. With the Citi exhibition Arctic: culture and climate the Museum used its collection to demonstrate how human resilience and ingenuity have helped the inhabitants of the Arctic region to survive and thrive. However, the exhibition also highlighted the challenge that we all face with the changing climate.
It is a challenge that we must all address and, as a global bank, we play an essential role in financing a sustainable economy. We are committed to financing and facilitating clean energy, infrastructure and technology projects that support environmental solutions and reduce the impacts of climate change, on rich and diverse communities such as those that inhabit the circumpolar Arctic.

Arctic countries need to lead the cut of CO2
The hottest temperature ever measured above the Arctic circle was recorded in Verkhoyansk, Siberia this past June. In fact, the + 38.6°C reading was just one of many highs that made June 2020 in Siberia five degrees warmer than any June from 1981 to 2010. A recent Oxford University-led study shows man-made climate change due to carbon emissions made this Siberian heatwave 600 times more likely. Read more
The Arctic is warming at a rate of almost twice the global average.
Without urgent action to cut greenhouse gas emissions, the world will continue to feel the effects of a warming Arctic: rising sea levels, changes in climate and precipitation patterns, increasing severe weather events, and loss of fish stocks, birds and marine mammals.
Why it matters
The average temperature of the Arctic has increased 2.3°C since the 1970s.
By 2100, polar bears could face starvation and reproductive failure even in far northern Canada.
Around 35,000 walruses came ashore on the Alaska coast in September 2014. It’s the largest ‘haul out’ ever recorded. US government agencies estimated that 60 young walruses were crushed in the crowd.
Warmer winter temperatures have also increased the layers of ice in snow, making food more difficult to dig up in winter.
Fish stocks in the Barents Sea are moving north at up to 160 kilometres per decade as a result of climate change.
The fish are sensitive to changes in water temperature. This poses a risk for commercial and subsistence fisheries that may see fish resources move away from where they can harvest them. The moving fish also change the ecosystems into which they move.
On the tundra, rising temperatures have brought a new competitor - the Arctic fox’s much larger cousin, the red fox. Not only does the newcomer colonise their dens, it can also kill the smaller Arctic foxes.
In the ocean, both scientists and Inuit say killer whales appear to be increasing in numbers, and in the length of time they stay in the Arctic. Killer whales prey on narwhals and bowhead whales.
With increased shipping comes spill risk (both fuel and cargo), “black carbon” emissions that help to speed the rate of Arctic melting, ship noise that may also affect whales, and icebreaking that can disrupt ice crossing routes for people and animals.
In 2013, a large bulk carrier transited the Northwest Passage for the first time. In 2018, the first cargo ship transited the Arctic north of Russia.
Reduced ice cover is making offshore oil production in the Arctic more commercially viable. In 2014, the first commercial development of offshore oil (Prirazlomnoye) was pumped from Russian Arctic waters.
Our solutions
How we work
Communicating a warming Arctic
WWF brings the effects of climate change in the Arctic to a global audience, and makes the connections between Arctic warming and global impacts.
Helping highly endangered seals
As Finland's climate warms, the country is seeing less snow cover. WWF is helping the extremely endangered Saimaa ringed sealsfind suitable places to nest by creating man-made snow banks.
Planning a future for the Last Ice Area
WWF is looking at the future management of the ""Last Ice Area"", the place where summer sea ice is projected to persist longest.
Promoting renewable energy
WWF is advocating for renewable energy, and piloting renewable solutions with some Arctic communities.
Protecting the Last Ice Area in Greenland
The Last Ice Area will be essential as an enduring home for ice-dependent life. WWF-Denmark has made a proposal to include the Greenland section of the Last Ice Area on the tentative list for UNESCO world heritage.
Recommending action for walruses
The first circumpolar report on walrus conservation recommends research into the effects of industrial activities on the Arctic animals.
Surveying polar bears in Western Hudson Bay
WWF supports polar bear surveys using an innovative mark-recapture technique that does not require tranquilising the bears.
Teaching the next generation
WWF works with Students on Ice to provide high school students a first hand experience of the effects of climate change in the Arctic.

The GitHub Arctic Code Vault is a data repository preserved in the Arctic World Archive (AWA), a very-long-term archival facility 250 meters deep in the permafrost of an Arctic mountain.
The archive is located in a decommissioned coal mine in the Svalbard archipelago, closer to the North Pole than the Arctic Circle. GitHub captured a snapshot of every active public repository on 02/02/2020 and preserved that data in the Arctic Code Vault.
How the cold storage will last 1,000 years
Svalbard is regulated by the international Svalbard Treaty as a demilitarized zone. Home to the world’s northernmost town, it is one of the most remote and geopolitically stable human habitations on Earth.
The AWA (Arctic World Archive) is a joint initiative between Norwegian state-owned mining company Store Norske Spitsbergen Kulkompani (SNSK) and very-long-term digital preservation provider Piql AS. AWA is devoted to archival storage in perpetuity. The film reels are stored in a steel-walled container inside a sealed chamber within a decommissioned coal mine on the remote archipelago of Svalbard. The AWA already preserves historical and cultural data from Italy, Brazil, Norway, the Vatican, and many others.
While Svalbard is affected by climate change, it is likely to affect only the outermost few meters of permafrost in the foreseeable future. Warming is not expected to threaten the stability of the mine. The mine’s proximity to the famous Global Seed Vault, only a mile away, reinforces Svalbard’s status as a stable, very-long-term archive site for humanity’s collective knowledge.

A pristine Eden of mountain peaks, glacial structures and pretty much every shade of blue known to man, this winter wonderland sometimes seems too beautiful to be real. Polar bears, whales, reindeers and walruses dot the ice-strewn land and seascapes while wildflowers bloom on the inland plains. Come the seasonal equinoxes, Aurora Borealis throws up its dazzling display of lights. On some summer nights the sun never sets. Enchanting, stark and about as remote as you can get while crossing parts of eight countries – Norway, Sweden, Finland, Iceland, Greenland (Denmark), Russia, Canada and the USA – the Arctic Circle really is poles apart from the typical travel experience.
Each vessel is purpose-built for polar conditions, well-equipped and fitted with modern conveniences to create a home away from home. Each ship also boasts a team of professional chefs preparing high-quality meals around the clock, a crew of experienced sailors and expedition leaders to chart a course.
Expert leaders
Travel with polar experts in a range of fields – glaciology, ornithology, marine biology and natural history – who provide invaluable context and insight to the region. Trained guides in Arctic terrain ensure you can travel with peace of mind onboard and during onshore activities.
Onboard activities
When you’re not spotting wildlife from the deck, exploring onshore or taking part in an adventure activity, all our Arctic trips include educational seminars to learn about the region’s unique flora and fauna. On top of all that, there’s a library where you can do your own polar research or have some downtime in the lounge.
Full board
All cruises provide three meals a day, 24-hour tea and coffee, and activities including Zodiac excursions, onboard seminars and shore landings. Our chefs know just how to warm you up after your Arctic outing, just be ready for a second serving!
Safety
Our polar operators are the best in the business and make your safety travelling in this potentially hazardous region their number one priority, adhering to all international maritime and SOLAS regulations.

One of western Greenland’s highlights is the Ilulissat Icefjord, a World Heritage-listed wonder of glaciers and icebergs. It's the perfect location to navigate in a Zodiac, gaining a perspective on the ice formations that you just can't get from on shore.
This remote group of 191 islands, many covered in ice, forms the most northerly archipelago in Eurasia, lies entirely within the Arctic Circle and is part of the Russian Arctic National Park. Weather and ice conditions will shape your exploration, but this is one of your best chances to see polar bears.
Imagine being one of the few people in the world to get a bird’s eye view over the northern tip of the planet! Top off your experience at the top of the world with a champagne toast and a barbecue on the ice.
This headland is a well-known walrus hangout, and one of our possible landing spots on Svalbard. Fun fact: walrus’s hides turn pink while they lounge in the sun as blood is pumped to the surface of their skin to aid cooling, similar to what happens to hippopotamuses in Africa.
Spanning eight countries above the Arctic Circle, and part of three continents, the Arctic is one of the most diverse regions in the world. Here’s a glance at some of the wildlife you might encounter on a visit.
We know you want to be as comfortable as possible while on board, which is why we’ve chosen vessels equipped with modern conveniences along with luxurious touches that make each voyage a true pleasure.

But recently the question of whether the Arctic might be viewed as an arena for military competition has reappeared. Marc Lanteigne, Associate Professor of Political Science at The Arctic University of Norway, explains.","Over the past year, the Arctic has been receiving a series of unpleasant wake-up calls about security in the region. Following more than twenty years of the Far North being widely viewed as disconnected from ‘traditional’ hard strategic concerns, the question of whether the Arctic might be viewed as an arena for military competition has reappeared.
For the past couple of decades, the Arctic had been viewed as an area of ‘high north, low tension’. The watershed speech by the last president of the Soviet Union, Mikhail Gorbachev, in Murmansk in 1987, had called for peacebuilding measures to lessen strategic tensions in the Arctic. And in 1996, the then newly created Arctic Council decided to leave security affairs off its agenda in the organisation’s founding document.
Within the Arctic Council, its eight members – Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Russia and the United States – sought to promote the Arctic as a zone of cooperation and joint problem-solving, while recognising the distinct geography, demographics and economics of the Far North. Despite a cooling of relations between Russia and the United States since the start of the conflict in Ukraine in 2014, a tacit agreement among the membership cordoned off non-Arctic political and security concerns from the Council’s deliberations and overall Arctic diplomacy.
This situation has shifted abruptly, however, due to two major factors. The first is the more visible overspill of conflicting great power policies, especially between Russia and the United States, into the Arctic as both countries recognise the region is more central to their strategic interests. The second is the growing attention paid by non-Arctic states to Arctic affairs, especially as the Far North welcomes greater economic activity. While China may be leading this process, other non-Arctic governments have also sought to develop more robust Arctic policy interests. These include Japan, Singapore, South Korea and several European actors – France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland and the United Kingdom – as well as the European Union as a whole. As a result, the Arctic has increasingly been moving away from the international strategic periphery, raising the question of the degree to which the Arctic should be considered an international security concern as opposed to a regional one.
Environmental and economic issues
Other economic and environmental security issues have appeared on the Arctic agenda in recent years as the region becomes more accessible to shipping and extractive industries, including fossil fuels, mining and fishing.
As once-dormant sea routes in the Arctic Ocean become ice-free for longer periods of time, maritime security concerns including search and rescue, incidents at sea, and codes of conduct for regional sea-lane transit have been subject to debates and subsequent agreements. Foremost among these has been the 2017 Polar Code, which seeks to regulate civilian ship transit both in the Arctic and in the waters off Antarctica. Addressing the concerns about overfishing in the region as more open water becomes reachable, a fishing ban in the Central Arctic Ocean commenced in October 2018 with the support of the European Union, Russia and the United States as well as Canada, China, Iceland, Japan, Norway and South Korea.
Currently, drilling for fossil fuels in the Arctic has not taken place on a major scale, due to comparatively low world energy prices during the last five years. However, some noteworthy projects have been spearheaded by Russia, including the Yamal liquefied natural gas (LNG) initiative, supported by Chinese and French interests, as well as emerging spinoff enterprises. The US government’s attempts to open northern Alaska to offshore oil drilling, despite environmental and legal concerns, have so far been unsuccessful. Over the past decade, many warnings have been raised about an ‘Arctic scramble’, as numerous countries sought to enter the region in search of more easily obtainable resources, but a fully developed economic competition has yet to take place. This is due not only to lower energy prices since 2014, but also to the fact that many of said resources lie uncontested, well within the lands and waters of the Arctic states.
Beyond the exclusive economic zones of the Arctic Ocean littoral states, there have been some disagreements about maritime boundaries and, for a time, these added to speculation that the region was going to be subject to contests over economic and political sovereignty. The now infamous incident in 2007, when a metal Russian flag was placed under the ice near the North Pole by a Russian submarine, was arguably the catalyst for this ongoing speculation. Nonetheless, many disagreements over Arctic maritime boundaries have either been resolved or continue to be quietly negotiated. A potentially thorny maritime border dispute between Norway and Russia in the Barents Sea was defused by a 2010 agreement. The contested status of Hans Island (Tartupaluk in Greenlandic) has so far eluded a similar resolution but talks between Canada and Denmark over its eventual political status continue.
A potentially more complicated disagreement involves the North Pole itself, and more specifically the competing claims to the underwater Lomonosov Ridge, which extends well into the Central Arctic including the North Pole. The ridge’s area is claimed by Canada, Denmark (via Greenland) and Russia, which have all asserted the region is part of their respective continental shelves. All three governments have submitted updated claims to the United Nations Commission on Limits of the Continental Shelf, with Ottawa being the latest to do so in May of this year. The resolution of the dispute may have profound effects on the balance of economic and perhaps even strategic power in the Arctic but, again, this competition has been wholly relegated to diplomatic circles and may also ultimately be decided by bilateral agreements, along similar lines to the resolution the Norway-Russia dispute in the Barents Sea.
The reintroduction of military concerns
Russia under President Vladimir Putin has moved to develop the Arctic as a major component of efforts to boost the Russian economy, which is feeling the brunt of Western sanctions and economic isolation in the wake of the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014. Moscow is optimistic about the potential for Siberia and the Russian Far East to provide major boosts to the country’s economy via the energy projects, the opening of the Northern Sea Route for faster Asia-Europe maritime shipping, and the associated building of ports and infrastructure to support Arctic sea trade. This has indicated Russia is also seeking to protect Arctic assets in ways which began to catch the attention of the United States and its northern European allies.
Previously abandoned Cold War-era military installations have been reopened and incursions by Russian aircraft and submarines into or close to other countries’ Arctic spaces have become more frequent. (There was even a bizarre case in May of this year of a beluga whale, wearing a Russian-made harness, being captured off the northern coast of Norway which, allegedly, may have been dispatched for spying purposes.) The most recent large-scale exercises by the Russian military, Vostok 2018, included operations throughout Siberia and the Russian Far East; and Moscow has increased trans-Arctic radar coverage and developed systems for radio-electronic jamming of foreign aircraft and vessels.
The United States and NATO Allies had been responding to these activities on many fronts. These include improvements to the US Navy’s Second Fleet, such as developing the means to operate more visibly in the Arctic; the renovating and making use of facilities in Keflavik, Iceland, by the United States after American forces had withdrawn in 2006; and long-delayed plans being finalised for the construction of new icebreakers to replace the two aging vessels still in operation by the US Coast Guard. In comparison, Russia currently has more than forty functioning icebreakers, including nuclear-powered ships. In April this year, the latest such nuclear-powered vessel, the Ural, was formally launched in St Petersburg.
By far the most visible sign that Washington had begun to view the Arctic through a military lens – adding greatly to the ‘sudden’ aspect of the emergence of hard security concerns in the region – was illustrated by United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s speech at the Arctic Council’s Ministerial meeting in Rovaniemi, Finland, in May this year. His remarks pointed to other Arctic actors as military threats and suggested that Russian claims to the Northern Sea Route and Canadian sovereignty over the Northwest Passage (which Washington views as international waters) were ‘illegitimate’. Moreover, his speech omitted any mention of climate change and, at the end of the meeting, the Council was unable to release an official declaration because the United States delegation would not support any statement from the gathering which made reference to climate change.
Another notable aspect about Secretary Pompeo’s speech in relation to Arctic security concerns was that his presentation not only singled out Russia and Canada for criticism, but also China, which despite not being an Arctic state has significantly augmented its Arctic policies in the areas of scientific diplomacy and economic cooperation over the past decade. Mr Pompeo sharply criticised Beijing for expanding its Arctic interests, despite, as noted above, several other non-Arctic states, including US allies, having done the same. He also implied that China was seeking to develop strategies in the Arctic Ocean which were similar to those in place regarding the South China Sea, despite the two cases having dramatically different political and legal frameworks.
American government statements published earlier this year – including an April 2019 policy paper by the US Coast Guard and the annual report on China’s military activity by the US Department of Defense released the following month – also sought to paint Beijing as an Arctic spoiler, including by suggesting that China’s scientific interests in the region may lead to overt Arctic military strategies, including submarine deployments. The United States (as well as Denmark) has also been anxious about China’s expanding economic interests in Greenland, including in mining and potential infrastructure investment. China has also announced its intention to build a nuclear-powered icebreaker (the country currently has two conventional icebreaking ships capable of Arctic operations) and that technology could in theory be transferred to military vessels.
Attempting to leverage China out of the Arctic may be moot, given that Beijing has already established strong ties with other Arctic states, including Russia, but also in the Nordic region. Moreover, Beijing is now in a position to affect much emerging Arctic policy given its size and economic strength. Immediately following the Arctic Council meeting in Finland, an Arctic Circle forum was held in Shanghai in which Chinese Arctic achievements in research and investments were highlighted, including as part of the Belt and Road Initiative, which formally added the Arctic in 2017. Descriptions of an ‘Ice Silk Road’ were further elucidated in Beijing’s January 2018 White Paper on Arctic policy. At the Shanghai meeting, it was also hinted that China was interested in spearheading new organisations in the Arctic – a further sign that the country, while stressing that it is not seeking to challenge the current state of Arctic governance, is not going to accept being marginalised in the region either.
Both Russia and the United States are continuing to show signs of hardening their Arctic strategies. The Putin government has announced new stipulations on the use of the Northern Sea Route by foreign vessels, including mandatory 45-day notifications and the transfer of information on ships and their cargo to Russian authorities. These rules have been denigrated by American officials, with one US Admiral responding to these policy changes by stating that the Arctic was ‘nobody’s lake’.
The United States, meanwhile, is hoping to conduct ‘freedom of navigation operations’ in the Arctic this summer, despite the considerable logistical challenges involved and likely opposition from both Canada and Russia. This month, the US Department of Defense released an updated Arctic strategy report, reiterating the challenges which China and Russia present to security in the region, including concerns that Beijing may seek to influence Arctic governance via its economic power. The paper confirmed that the United States should build greater awareness of Arctic challenges, enhance operations in the region, including conducting exercises and cold-weather training, and strengthen the Arctic’s ‘rules-based order’.
The Arctic is now facing a potential ‘revenge of Realpolitik’ in regards to regional security, as the strategic concerns of both major Arctic players, Russia and the United States, along with those of large non-Arctic states such as China, are starting to enter the region with much more regularity. As the Far North continues to be a source of international focus due to threats of climate change, those security concerns may now have to share figurative space with classical power politics, as the region continues to move away from the strategic periphery and towards an uncertain mainstream in emerging global strategic discourses.",,Nato Review,,,2019-06-28,Nato Review

In just the past three decades, global warming has shrunk the size of the Arctic Ocean’s summer ice by half. The region is now more accessible than it’s been in 1,000 years, and governments around the world have taken notice.
The melting of the Arctic has grave implications for global weather patterns and rising sea levels, and most of the world sees it as a looming disaster. But for the five Arctic nations — the US, Canada, Denmark, Norway, and Russia — it also presents an opportunity: access to promising new trade routes and untapped fossil fuel resources.
Each country has jurisdiction to exploit the natural resources within 200 nautical miles of its coast, an “exclusive economic zone.” They can reach beyond that distance if the submerged part of their land, their continental shelf, extends beyond the 200 nautical miles. Countries make claims based on where they argue the edges of their continental shelves are. Problems arise when claims overlap, as they do in multiple cases here.
To witness the new Arctic geopolitics with my own eyes, I traveled to Svalbard, a set of Norwegian islands that houses the northernmost diplomatic consulate in the world. That consulate belongs to the country that has made the most aggressive moves in the region, a country that has planted a flag at the bottom of the sea and built up dozens of Arctic military assets: Russia.
In the Arctic, Russia has the most to gain as the ice melts. As I journeyed through the region, I saw just how far Russia is willing to go to secure influence in this new frontier:",,,,,2017-12-05,Vox.com

A safe, stable, sustainable and prosperous Arctic is important not just for the region itself, but for the EU and the rest of the world. While the Arctic region is rich in resources both on land and in the seas, the Arctic faces several challenges due among other things to its sparse population, limited logistical networks, and fragile environmental conditions.
The inhabitants of the Arctic are familiar with these conditions – however harsh they may seem to people living in lower latitudes – and have socio-economic aspirations for sustainable development under Arctic conditions. The indigenous peoples who have lived in various parts of this vast region for millennia have specific traditional knowledge and across the Arctic region, several forms of traditional livelihoods have developed over the centuries, not least reindeer herding, fishing, and hunting. As modern life has increasingly taken hold in Arctic regions, other forms of economic activity and technologies have been added. These include public administration and education, more intensive fishing, maritime and shipping operations, resource extraction, research activities, tourism, telecommunications etc.
The Arctic region attracts increasing interest from economic and civil society within each Arctic state as well as from many other parts of the world.
The EU is committed to implementing the United Nations (UN) 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development to achieve sustainable development in its three dimensions – economic, social and environmental – in a balanced and integrated manner. Several EU activities taking place in and relating to the Arctic region should contribute to the achievement of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
In order to support socio-economic activities taking place in the Arctic regions, Arctic infrastructure and logistics play an important role as enabling factors. These sectors also have strong growth potential, as well as environmental impacts and social implications in their own right.
The Commission Directorate-General for Regional and Urban Policy (DG Regio) and Directorate-General for Mobility and Transport (DG Move) are leading EU work to increase infrastructure capacity and improve transport connectivity in the Arctic. Depending on the context, the EU can support activities in these sectors, thereby contributing to increasing productivity and improving trade between the Arctic and the EU. It remains important to pay due attention to increased environmental impacts as well as positive and/or potentially adverse implications for social cohesion and mobility.
Infrastructure
The EU Cohesion Policy 2014-2020 supports Arctic investments and capacity building.
The Investment Plan for Europe supports various infrastructure projects in the European Arctic, including Greenland.
Increasing infrastructure capacity and transport connectivity contributes to 'building resilient infrastructure, promoting sustainable industrialization and fostering innovation' (UN Sustainable Development Goal 9).
The EU’s environment policies promote the transformation towards an inclusive green economy that balances environmental considerations with growth, creates jobs and helps reduce poverty through sustainable management of natural capital. Resource efficiency, ecosystem resilience and human well-being are three crucial factors needed to find the balance between development and sustainability.
The Commission Directorate-General for Environment (DG Env) together with the European Environment Agency (EEA) leads EU work on environmental matters, including the promotion of the green economy.
Further information on EU work to safeguard the Arctic environment can be found on the Climate Change and the Arctic Environment subpage.
Using innovation
To protect the environment and make EU industry more competitive, we need technologies, processes and business models that use resources more efficiently. We call these solutions 'eco-innovation'. The EU supports green technology and green products through a range of funding schemes and policies (non-exhaustive list):
Resource efficiency
Europe 2020, the EU's growth strategy, aims to make the EU a smart, sustainable and inclusive economy. This includes encouraging the use of resources, such as water, minerals and timber, in a more sustainable way. One of the building blocks of this initiative is the Roadmap to a Resource-Efficient Europe.
Sustainable consumption and production
Sustainable consumption and production maximises business' potential to transform environmental challenges into economic opportunities and provide a better deal for consumers. A range of EU and national policies foster resource efficient and eco-friendly products and raise consumer awareness. Notably, the Sustainable Consumption and Production Action Plan aims to improve the environmental performance of products and increase the demand for more sustainable goods and production technologies.
Preventing and managing waste
In order to promote the sustainable use of resources in the Arctic, the EU will share experiences and best practices on the circular economy with Arctic states.
Managing water resources
Access to good quality water and having a healthy marine environment are essential for people, nature and economic activities. The EU's Water Framework Directive aims to ensure good quality water around the EU by managing river basin systems in a coordinated way at regional and national levels.
Encouraging a move towards the green economy in the ways described above contributes to 'ensuring sustainable consumption and production patterns' (UN Sustainable Development Goal 12).
The Commission Directorate-General for Maritime Affairs and Fisheries (DG Mare), Directorate-General for Mobility and Transport (DG Move) and the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA), as well as the Directorate-General for Joint Research Centre (DG JRC), are leading EU work to facilitate the development of safe and secure maritime activities in the Arctic, notably through the Blue Growth strategy. Sectors of the blue economy include aquaculture, coastal tourism, marine biotechnology, ocean energy, and seabed extraction.
As the Arctic sea ice melts, the Northeast and Northwest passages become more accessible and maritime traffic in the Arctic may increase in the medium to long term. Furthermore, some fish stocks are now moving further north and fishing fleets are interested in following them; this raises interest in fishing regimes and the preservation of marine biodiversity etc. These maritime activities also require more attention to Arctic shipping safety.
Sustainable ocean governance
The EU aims to ensure that our oceans are safe, secure, clean and sustainably managed, as outlined in the Joint Communication on an International ocean governance agenda for the future of our oceans. The Joint Communication proposes work to be undertaken in three priority areas: improving the institutional framework; sustainable management to reduce human impact; and investing in knowledge and data for the oceans. The EU conducts various activities in line with this aim (non-exhaustive list):
Supporting the safe and sustainable blue economy contributes to 'conserving and sustainably using the oceans, seas and marine resources' (UN Sustainable Development Goal 14).
The Commission Directorate-General for International Cooperation and Development (DG DEVCO) leads EU work to help enhance education in the Arctic Overseas Countries and Territories (OCTs) (Greenland). The Directorate-General for Research & Innovation (DG RTD) also contributes to this work.
Technology for learning
Access to broadband internet can facilitate distance learning, on-line courses, file sharing, video uploads and other on-line educational support tools. EU satellite technologies and programmes are being used to support the educational needs of Arctic communities.
Arctic research and science education
EDU-ARCTIC is an innovative educational programme which aims to encourage students to pursue further education in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) and polar research. EDU-ARCTIC focuses on using Arctic research as a vehicle to strengthen science education curricula all across Europe. The EDU-ARCTIC project uses a mix of different tools to bring a fresh approach to teaching STEM subjects.
Greenland
Greenland is an autonomous territory within the Kingdom of Denmark, but withdrew from the EU in 1985. Greenland is now associated with the EU as one of the Overseas Countries and Territories (OCTs). DG DEVCO leads on all work relating to the OCTs. Relations between Greenland, the Kingdom of Denmark and the EU were reconfirmed by the signing of the 2015 Joint Declaration by the European Union, on the one hand, and the Government of Greenland and the Government of Denmark, on the other, on relations between the European Union and Greenland. Cooperation activities between Greenland and the EU fall under the Fisheries partnership agreement and/or the EU-Greenland Partnership.
Through the EU-Greenland Partnership, Greenland is eligible for EU funding, which is delivered through the Instrument for Greenland (IfG). Education, vocational training and the post-elementary school system are the main focus under the EU-Greenland Partnership.
Contributing to the development of education as described above works towards 'ensuring inclusive and quality education for all and promoting lifelong learning' (UN Sustainable Development Goal 4).
The Commission Directorate-General for Maritime Affairs and Fisheries (DG Mare) leads on the EU's work with Arctic indigenous peoples. Sustainable development in the Arctic is important to indigenous peoples, and should take into account their traditional livelihoods. In order to preserve and share traditional knowledge, dialogue with and between those living in the Arctic region is essential.
Indigenous Peoples Dialogue
The EU, led by DG Mare, organises the Arctic Indigenous Peoples Dialogue on a regular basis. This dialogue is a forum where Arctic indigenous peoples can exchange views and agree on areas for further cooperation with the EU, particularly in relation to sustainable development.
Tourism in the Arctic regions is developing rapidly, although in different forms across the Arctic region. While tourism brings important benefits to many Northern communities through economic growth, job creation, improved connections to lower latitudes (flights, telecommunications, social networks etc.) and increasing interest in local and indigenous goods, the potential risks to the fragile Arctic environment and to traditional ways of life cannot be ignored.
The Commission Directorate-General for Growth (DG Grow), Directorate-General for Environment (DG Env) and the Directorate-General for Regional and Urban Policy (DG Regio) lead EU work to support the development of sustainable Arctic tourism.
EU Tourism policy
A significant proportion of tourists to the Arctic are EU citizens. One priority of the EU Tourism Policy is to promote the development of sustainable, responsible, and high-quality tourism. Several Member States have created initiatives to promote sustainable tourism which incorporate the recommendations of the EU Tourism Policy.
Cruise ship tourism
With the thaw of sea ice, the cruise ship industry in the Arctic is growing. This brings significant economic benefits, but also risks, including the potential for grounding or sinking, oil spills, waste water discharge and water pollution.
In order to mitigate the potential for risk, the Arctic cruise ship industry is subject to EU standards for waste management, as well as related regulations under the International Maritime Organization (IMO).
Investment
In addition to funding available through the EU Tourism policy, the EU funds various projects to promote sustainable tourism in the Arctic (non-exhaustive list):
The Commission Directorate-General for Regional and Urban Policy (DG Regio) leads EU work to increase communications connectivity, and the Directorate-General for Growth (DG Grow) is leading EU work on space technology.
Some obstacles to sustainable development in the Arctic stem from its vast size, extreme climatic conditions, sparse population and relative inaccessibility. These challenges can be countered through EU space-based services which are able to provide cost-effective solutions to meet the needs of those living and working in the region.
Improved access to the internet and other means of communication in Arctic regions is an important factor that could increase economic productivity and facilitate access to wider markets for businesses operating in the Arctic. Increased connectivity could also bring strong social benefits, increasing the possibility for communication and creating/strengthening active links between indigenous communities, as well as facilitating remote education and public administration activities.
Earth observations
EU space programmes provide powerful observation coverage and operational services in the Arctic, which could increase efficiency in agriculture and fisheries, optimise transport, and improve crisis response.
Data sharing
As a member of the Group on Earth Observations (GEO), the EU will promote an integrated pan-Arctic observing system through the GEO Cold Region Initiative (GEOCRI), which aims to promote Earth observations data sharing and cooperation, enabling improved information services for stakeholders. This action has been funded by Horizon 2020, the EU Research and Innovation Framework Programme which is contributing to the ongoing development of pan-Arctic observing initiatives.
Investment
Through the Structural Funds programme 2014-2020, Sweden and Finland have both been allocated funding for regional projects, including investment in broadband. These investments build on national and/or regional growth and smart specialisation strategies.
The Commission Directorate-General for Research & Innovation (DG RTD), the Joint Research Centre (DG JRC), and the Directorate-General for Growth (DG Grow), along with the Directorate-General for Regional and Urban Policy (DG Regio) are leading EU work in supporting sustainable innovation and local businesses. The use of innovative technologies in the Arctic has the potential to bring broad social and economic benefits both within and beyond the Arctic region. The EU is supporting innovation in the Arctic through a variety of activities.
Funding programmes
The EU Research and Innovation Framework Programme Horizon 2020 supports actions that could speed up the translation of research outcomes into cold-climate technologies and services with commercial potential. InnovFin - EU Finance for innovators is one such Horizon 2020 instrument; a joint initiative with the European Investment Bank Group, to help Arctic-related research and innovation projects get access to the market.
The INTERACT (DG Regio) cooperation programmes, funded by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), provide free advice, services and products to support Interreg projects and facilitate exchanges between partners.
Collaboration between EU-funded programmes
Cross-programme collaboration is encouraged and mandated by the European Commission and the EU High Representative in the Joint Communication A new integrated EU policy for the Arctic. Ultimately, the collaboration should provide input for establishing research and investment priorities in the European Arctic.
Cross-programme collaboration is coordinated by the Northern Periphery and Arctic Programme. Participating programmes are Interreg Botnia-Atlantica, Interreg Nord, Kolarctic CBC, and Karelia CBC. The collaboration will consider including other programmes. With a view to enabling high complementarity with other policy initiatives and stakeholder organisations operating in the Arctic, these organisations will be consulted or involved where appropriate.
The programmes are working on:
You can find more information on the Northern Periphery and Arctic Programme website.
The EU is also funding research and innovation projects in the Arctic through the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF) programmes.
Supporting local businesses
The EU offers free support to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) through the Enterprise Europe Network which helps make the most of business opportunities in the EU and beyond. The Network will continue to ‘coach’ Arctic SMEs at their request. Furthermore, the EU invests in businesses operating in the Arctic through the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD).
The EU contributes European Structural and Investment ESI funds to kick-start growth, job creation and investment across Europe, notably in the least developed areas and sectors with growth potential.
European Investment Advisory Hub and Project Portal is a 'one-stop-shop' for investors or project promoters and public managing authorities to provide advice at EU and local levels on project identification, development and preparation.
Supporting innovation and local businesses in the Arctic in this way contributes to 'promoting inclusive and sustainable economic growth, employment and decent work for all' (UN Sustainable Development Goal 8).
The EU, led by the Commission Directorate-General for Maritime Affairs and Fisheries (DG Mare), has set up an Arctic Stakeholder Forum (ASF). This forum brings together EU institutions, European Arctic Member States, regional and local authorities, and indigenous peoples to identify key investment and research priorities for the coming years and enhance collaboration and coordination between different EU funding programmes.
From 2018, the ASF will be replaced by an Arctic Stakeholder Conference.",,,,European Commission|European Union|EU,2021-02-02,EEAS - European External Action Service - European Commission

The project brings together academic experts on the economics of living marine resources and the Arctic ocean with on-the-ground resource managers and policy makers in the Arctic region to improve and advance understanding of how management of these valuable resources will be affected by changes in accessibility to the region. We are developing flexible, ecosystem-integrated management solutions to the challenges these changes pose.
There are a variety of scales for marine resource use that should be considered directly pertinent to the Arctic community, from local indigenous populations that have historical use claims to the Nordic states, with their differing obligations on governance at the regional scale, and even at the global level as driven by growing global demand for the resources present in the Arctic.
The ecosystem changes underway in the Arctic region are expected to have significant impacts on living resources in both the short and long run. Current actions and policies adopted by the Nordic states and other invested parties over such resource governance will have serious and ultimately irreversible consequences in the near and long terms. In particular, the breadth and scope of integration of science and political economy into the formulation of strategies for economic resource use and preservation will determine the outcomes of such policies. For example, policies to contain an invasive species in one nation’s waters will be limited in effectiveness by decisions of neighboring nations as well as by the ecological context of the invasion. Coordinated resource policy across space and time is therefore essential to maximizing the full economic value, including potential non-use and indirect-use values, of the living resources of the Arctic Ocean as the base productivity undergoes ecological changes. We use an ecosystem based and strategic approach to analyze harvesting practices, invasive species and pollution issues and describe opportunities for marine conservation. So, we are working with a broader group than traditional resource economists, in particular including on-the-ground managers.
We welcome input from Arctic stakeholders and researchers across disciplines:

You can thank global warming for that.","Surprise, surprise: The Arctic didn’t do too well this past year. You can thank global warming for that.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration released its annual Arctic Report Card Tuesday, and the findings show a region in the midst of a rapid transformation. Wildlife populations are decreasing, sea ice is melting, and the Arctic is warming the fuck up. Even more ominously, the frozen soil that rings the region is now unleashing more carbon than it takes up speeding up climate change.
This year, however, the report card highlights some new points, including the impact of shifting wind patterns and how indigenous people in the Arctic are particularly vulnerable.
The clearest sign of Arctic change are rising temperatures. The average temperature over the past 12 months ranked as the second-highest value since 1900 coming in at 1.9 degrees Celsius (3.4 degrees Fahrenheit) above normal. That’s helping melt Arctic sea ice cover, which has seen rapid declines in thickness and extent. The fragile state of ice leaves it vulnerable to random weather happenings, such as when the jetstream sends warm southerly winds north. That’s exactly what happened this past year, particularly in Alaska when unusual southwestern warm winds in fall 2018 kept sea ice from freezing in along the coastal Bering Sea. This happened again in winter 2019 and continued into the spring.
“In the past when that happened, it hasn’t had a big impact because the ice is already there and very thick,” James Overland, an oceanographer at NOAA who worked on this report, told Earther. “This year, you started with thin ice, so when winds shifted around to coming from the south and bringing more warm temperatures, the ice could never form, and that was a huge change that we never expected would happen this soon .”
As a result of all this warm air—which was related to the wild ass heatwaves Europe saw this year—the Greenland ice sheet a massive meltdown over the summer. The only year worse was 2012. This presents a long-term concern for sea level rise worldwide, but the loss of sea ice throughout the Arctic threatens the culture and livelihoods of the people who live there. And, for the first time ever, the Arctic Report Card pays special attention to the impacts indigenous people face. It even includes a whole section featuring voices from the frontlines. Overland said that was intentional.
“Most of us are looking at the Arctic from satellite pictures from way above and the big picture,” he said. “Particularly with emphasis on the Bering Sea, loss of ice and these changes in the ecosystem are erratically impacting these coastal communities from the timing from when they hunt for whales and seals and so forth. ”
Sea ice loss really damages the way of life for these communities because they depend on the ice’s stability to travel and reach the waters they depend on to hunt. But the shifts in the Arctic aren’t just a concern for the people who live there. They could have a profound impact on the climate.
This year’s report also contains a major warning siren about permafrost, icy soil that stores roughly 10 times more carbon than the Amazon. Rising temperatures are causing it to thaw. That means many indigenous families are also losing access to their traditional means of storing food in ice cellars.
But for the rest of us, the impacts are also extremely worrisome. This year’s report card shows that melting permafrost is releasing carbon back into the atmosphere at a faster rate than the region’s plants are taking up. Estimates for how much carbon the Arctic is emitting range from 300 up to 600 million tons. Those emissions mean the Arctic isn’t just being impacted by the climate crisis. It’s now contributing to it.","DISCUSSION
Honest question, has the overall outlook for humans ever been this bleak, and we knew it?
I didn’t live through WW1, or the height of the Cold War or anything, did it ever feel this hopeless before, and like we’re seriously looking at the end of our way of life within the century?",Yessenia Funes,Climate change,ICE ICE MAYBE|arctic report card|NOAA|science|arctic|Earther,2019-12-10,Earther

We’re helping Arctic animals adapt to a rapidly changing climate
When you see the Arctic on TV, its frozen seas and vast expanses of ice and snow look like they belong on another planet.
But the damage climate change is causing to the region could have catastrophic consequences much closer to home.
What’s at stake?
As the Earth warms up, melting Arctic ice will lead to rising sea levels, which will play havoc with our coasts.
And global warming in the Arctic may release huge reserves of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas.
These could speed up the effects of climate change everywhere if they’re released.
What happens in the Arctic directly affects the rest of the planet. That’s one reason why we’ve made protecting this amazing place, and the animals that make it their home, a priority.
The story so far
We’ve been active in the Arctic for decades.
Back in 1973, we helped convince the five governments of the region to sign a treaty to protect polar bears.
Controls on hunting were so successful that 10 years later the number of bears in Norway had doubled. And in 1974, WWF worked with the Greenland.
We’ve highlighted some of the most compelling stories of climate change to emerge from the Arctic, from Greenland’s melting ice sheet, to a new ocean emerging from the frozen cocoon of Arctic sea ice.
At the same time we’re protecting unique habitats and wildlife, such as polar bears, walruses and bowhead whales. More than 350,000 sq km of the Arctic is now protected from threats such as mining and oil drilling.
Did you know?
Polar bears are so well insulated that they have to move slowly to avoid overheating.
Facts and stats
- >10% - rate at which summer sea ice is disappearing per decade, threatening species like polar bears
- ¼ - estimated proportion of the world’s untapped oil and gas reserves found in the Arctic. As the ice moves out, oil companies are moving in.
- 25,000 – polar bears in the wild today
What next?
Today, climate change is the biggest threat facing the Arctic and its wildlife. Polar bears, for example, depend on summer sea ice to hunt seals. As the Earth heats up and the ice disappears, scientists estimate that two-thirds of polar bears could be wiped out by 2050.
We’re researching how climate change is affecting Arctic ecosystems, and how we can help them adapt and survive. Our research into the effects of warming in the Arctic is also helping to influence international action on climate change.
We’re also supporting research on climate change and work with communities living in the Arctic, to help people get to grips with reality of climate change and its local and global effects.
At the same time, we’re working with governments and companies to reduce their impact on the Arctic. We need to give Arctic animals both the time and space to adapt.
WWF in action
“Species like polar bears represent the Arctic ecosystem, which is responsible for moderating global climate,” says Geoff York, who co-ordinates our work on polar bears and other Arctic species.
“Conserving these species and their habitat protects us from a warming climate. Arctic species are also a critically important aspect of indigenous cultures essential to the food security of those living in the region.
“Recently, WWF successfully lobbied Arctic governments to recognize climate change as the primary threat to the survival of the polar bear. These governments are now responsible for taking a lead on reducing global greenhouse gas emissions. They have publicly committed to the conservation of a species that depends on it.”

The Arctic region consists of Northern regions of EU countries (Arctic Finland and Arctic Sweden); the non-EU European Arctic (Greenland, Faroe Islands, Iceland, Arctic Norway); Northern Russia and the American Arctic.
Smart Specialisation concept developed for higher impact of the research and innovation investments of EU countries has found very relevant applications in European Arctic regions. Joint Communication by the European Commission and the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy on ‘An integrated European Union policy for the Arctic’ (2016) states that adaptation and implementation of regional smart specialisation strategies is a way to support sustainable growth models based on more sustainable use of resources.
Since 2015 the S3 Platform has been examining conditions and implications for Smart Specialisation in sparsely populated areas including Nordic regions, suggesting a tailor-made approach due to the challenges of critical mass and absorptive capacity. In 2018 this work has been elaborated further with focus on the European Arctic.

This is leading to new maritime concerns, especially in areas increasingly transited by the offshore oil and gas industry, cruise liners, military craft, tugs and barges, and fishing vessels.
Keeping all of this new ocean traffic moving smoothly is a growing concern for safety's sake. It's also important to the U.S. economy, environment, and national security. That's why NOAA is striving to update Arctic nautical charts, add new tide and current monitoring stations, conduct geodetic surveys in the region, and prepare for potential incidents.
Commercial and recreational vessels depend on NOAA to provide navigational charts and the U.S. Coast Pilot. These tools supply mariners with the latest information on depths, aids to navigation, accurate shorelines, and other features required for safe navigation.
Many of these tools, however, are unavailable or outdated for areas in the Arctic. Until recently, most of this region was relatively inaccessible by ship due to the presence of thick, impenetrable sea ice. Added to this, most Arctic waters that are charted were surveyed with imprecise technology, dating back to the 1800s, before the region was part of the United States. Most of the shoreline along Alaska’s northern and western coasts has not been mapped since 1960. As a result, confidence in the region’s nautical charts is low.
Creating charts and other tools that depict spatial relationships requires a geospatial foundation—or consistent reference system—that describes the location of everything. Many areas of Alaska lack the geospatial foundation that is needed to fully support marine transportation and maritime domain awareness. For example, one percent of the Alaskan shoreline is updated annually using aerial and satellite imagery, compared to five percent elsewhere in the United States.
The Arctic region especially needs the gravity data necessary for a modern vertical reference system, so NOAA’s National Geodetic Survey is collecting airborne gravity data in Alaska. National Geodetic Survey also manages a network of GPS receivers that monitor three-dimension land movement over time. The Continuously Operating Reference Station network is critical for activities requiring precise positioning. NOAA is working with partners to fill in the gaps that exist in Arctic coverage, to improve the precision of survey positions and the measurement of land movement.
Of the 568,000 square nautical miles (SNM) in the U.S. Arctic Exclusive Economic Zone, less than half is what NOAA considers “navigationally significant.” Surveying over a quarter of a million SNM would take decades, so NOAA has designated 38,000 SNM as survey priority areas in the Arctic. Estimates range up to 25 years for surveying those priority areas, if resources remain at their current level.
NOAA began acquiring hydrographic data to support these emerging Arctic priorities in 2010 with a hydrographic survey of the Bering Strait and Port Clarence, Alaska. In 2012, NOAA conducted a 1,500 nautical mile reconnaissance survey, from Dutch Harbor, Alaska, to the Canadian border, checking historic data against current depth readings. That reconnaissance informs priorities for surveys in 2013 and beyond.
The Office of Coast Survey updates hydrographic priorities annually.
Modern U.S. navigational charts are a compilation of the best data available. Nevertheless, many of the soundings on the charts are from as early as the 1800s. As transportation pressures mount in Arctic seaways, NOAA is now working to update outdated Arctic nautical charts to meet modern needs.
In 2011, NOAA issued an Arctic Nautical Charting Plan after consultations with maritime interests and the public, as well as with other federal, state, and local governments. NOAA updated the plan in 2013, outlining the creation of 14 new charts to complement the existing chart coverage. Since the update, Coast Survey released a new nautical chart for the Arctic, helping mariners navigate the Bering Strait. Chart 16190 (Bering Strait North) incorporates precise depth measurements acquired recently by NOAA Ship Fairweather hydrographic surveys.
NOAA's Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services' (CO-OPS) National Water Level Observation Network (NWLON) provides the reference system of tidal and water level datums. CO-OPS operates 10 longterm NWLON tide stations in the Arctic region of Alaska and 16 others throughout the rest of the state.
There are 27 identified gaps in watel level observation coverage in Alaska, and 19 of those are located within the Arctic region. The gaps encompass most of the Arctic. Longterm plans include establishing new NWLON stations in these harsh environments, ideally co-located with National Geodetic Survey’s Continually Operating Reference System stations, to simultaneously provide measurements of local sea level change and land movement from the same position.
In many Arctic locations, tide and current predictions have never been calculated. For many other locations, tide and current predictions have not been measured since the early 1950s when only a few days of data were collected. Today we know that accurate predictions require at least 30 days of continuous data collection.
On October 6, 2010, NOAA led a U.S. delegation that formally established a new Arctic Regional Hydrographic Commission (ARHC) with four other nations known — together with the U.S. — as “Arctic coastal states.” The commission, which also includes Canada, Denmark, Norway, and the Russian Federation, promotes cooperation in hydrographic surveying and nautical charting. The Commission provides a forum for better collaboration to ensure safety of life at sea, protect the increasingly fragile Arctic ecosystem, and support the maritime economy.
For instance, at recent meetings of the ARHC held in January, 2014, efforts focused on data sharing, new technologies for improved hydrography, resolving duplicative efforts such as overlapping electronic charts, and the development of an arctic voyage planning guide to aid mariners who plan to transit arctic waters.
The agreement to form the ARHC was an historic event. Since the International Hydrographic Organization was formed in 1921, 15 regional hydrographic commissions have been established worldwide. The Arctic Ocean remained without such a commission until now.
As vessel traffic and energy exploration continues to increase in the Arctic, so does the likelihood of oil spills and other incidents. Through partnerships, cutting edge technology, and extensive data collection, NOAA works to prepare for potential incidents.
NOAA partnered with the U.S. Coast Guard on the Arctic Shield 2013 exercise, utilizing its unmanned aircraft system, the Puma, as one method to survey, identify, and monitor oil on and around ice floes from above. The data collected, including high resolution and infrared imagery, may be used in a variety of applications such as identifying and monitoring oiled environments and wildlife. NOAA’s Arctic Environmental Response Management Application (ERMA) was also utilized during this exercise. A stand-alone version of ERMA was developed as an internet-independent tool for use in remote locations such as the Arctic. Similar to the online site, Stand-alone ERMA displays prioritized NOAA data layers and key datasets from external sources and was used to quickly display data received from the Puma and other technologies during the exercise.
Arctic ERMA also includes information from the Alaska ShoreZone Coastal Inventory and Mapping Project, a partnership among NOAA and other government agencies, NGOs and private industry, is a comprehensive inventory of high-resolution imagery and descriptions of 80% of Alaska's coastal habitats. ShoreZone serves alongside NOAA's Environmental Sensitivity Index maps and data as a baseline for the coastal habitats of Alaska and is currently being used for environmental planning, preparedness, and Natural Resource Damage Assessment planning in Alaska.",,"US Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration",,Arctic|Navigation|Hydrographic Surveys|Nautical Charts|Charts|Bering Strait|geospatial|tides|currents|Arctic Shield|ShoreZone|ERMA|Navigational Charts|Ocean Service|ocean|NOS|National Ocean Service|NOAA|National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,2009-11-16,NOAA's National Ocean Service

We ask that you accept our invitation to discuss issues affecting our land. Our nuna, the Arctic.","""Our entire North American Arctic homeland is a vast wildlife habitat nourishing a very fragile food chain in which we Inuit are but an important link. We Inuit are hunters. There aren't many subsistence hunting societies left in the world, but our Inuit circumpolar community is one of them.""
Eben Hopson, 1978 Address to the London Press Corps
The Arctic is our Nunaat—our homeland. Nuna is land; Nunaat is homeland. As Inuit, we are intimately connected to the past, both distant and more recent. Why are we so closely tied to the Arctic marine ecosystem? We depend on it for our identity as indigenous peoples of the Arctic, for food security, for our transportation needs and mobility—for our future.
We are 165,000 people living in Canada, Greenland, the Russian Federation, and in the State of Alaska in the United States of America. Inuit are one people divided by what we consider to be artificial boundaries created by the old European colonial system. The Inuit Circumpolar Council (ICC) is a Permanent Participant in the Arctic Council and holds Consultative Status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council. ICC acts as a representative voice, speaking on behalf of all circumpolar Inuit on matters of international importance.
As we prepare for World Oceans Day on 8 June 2017, during which we will celebrate ""Our Oceans, Our Future"" and discuss how we can all support the implementation of Sustainable Development Goal 14 to ""conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources"", Inuit will be watching. In particular, we will be watching because our ocean and sea ice is changing right before our eyes. The sea ice is melting, the glaciers are melting, the permafrost is melting, the shorelines are eroding, the animals are changing and the ocean is changing. In addition to having to monitor these environmental changes with added sensitivity, Inuit are concerned that more and more people are coming north in search of non-renewable resources, such as oil, gas and minerals, as well as commercial fisheries and shorter, faster shipping routes. Tourists are coming to see it before it is gone. Many scientists are keenly interested in the changes and the effects of climate change in the Arctic and how they will impact the fate of the world's oceans and global weather patterns.
We are willing to share our indigenous knowledge of the ocean, the ice, the animals and the weather so we can work with the scientists, understand the change, and prepare our people and our communities to adapt. It will take all of our collective knowledge to understand the rapid and unpredictable changes we are witnessing across the Arctic marine environment.
We are concerned that it may be too late. The world may not be able to make decisions and take the action needed to protect the Arctic. This is a tragedy because the ocean is our future and we do not know what the future will hold.
Inuit are a marine people, dependent on the Arctic Ocean for our transportation and its marine resources for food security. Inuit life today also depends on movement, and that movement takes place across Arctic sea ice and on the open ocean. Our entire culture and identity are based on free movement on land, sea ice and the Arctic Ocean. We rely on free movement in order to eat, to obtain supplies for our traditional clothing and to preserve our rich cultural heritage through activities such as the creation of art. This movement takes place on the sea ice that surrounds and connects Inuit communities. During winter, our highway is sea ice. During summer, it is the open sea. This connection to land and ice gives Inuit a great sense of pride and community well-being, as well as a spiritual connection to our past.
It is the Inuit position that any action or intervention that affects our ice, the Arctic Ocean and the lands we live upon must protect the environment, wildlife and, therefore, Inuit, in such a way that we can continue to live off this land. This is the standard of sustainable use that we insist upon. The actions impacting the Arctic, however, are beyond our control.
ICC has participated in many international meetings and in numerous studies to understand the changes underway in our Arctic Ocean environment. The greatest threat to the Arctic Ocean and sea ice is climate change. ICC is active within the Arctic Council and in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, adding our voice to the negotiations. Not only is our sea ice changing, the Ocean itself is changing. Ocean acidification, for example, is an emerging issue. We know that the global increase in CO2 in the atmosphere is causing ocean acidification, and that the oceans act as a sink for this greenhouse gas. The Arctic Ocean is more vulnerable to acidification for many reasons, including the fact that colder waters absorb more CO2; that there is more freshwater entering the ocean, thus reducing its buffering capacity; that the reduced sea ice increases the area of open ocean and CO2, absorption; and that there is a shorter, more simplified marine food chain. These changes are not only locally and regionally significant but are globally important, as well. The Arctic ecosystem supports the life cycles of many millions of mammal, fish, bird, shellfish and plankton species that migrate around the world providing food for millions of people. We work to convince the world that protecting the Arctic indeed secures our common future.
""Our children no longer know the place names of our hunting grounds, nor have they traveled across the ice bridge that links these lands.""
This is what we are hearing in communities that surround Pikialasorsuaq, or ""Great Upwelling""—the largest Arctic polynya (area of open water surrounded by ice) and the most biologically productive region north of the Arctic Circle. Pikialasorsuaq has been recognized by Inuit for generations as a critical habitat. Communities in the Qikiqtani and Avanersuaq regions in Canada and Greenland rely on the polynyas biological productivity. Pikialasorsuaq is vital to many migratory species upon which these communities, as well as global species, depend. In recent years, the northern ice bridge in the Kane Basin, the Nares Strait and Smith Sound (Ikeq) has become less reliable and the polynya less defined. The consequences of these changes, which are linked to larger climatic shifts observable in many parts of the Arctic, are not known.
ICC initiated the Pikialasorsuaq Commission to address issues with an ecosystem that has supported Inuit communities for millennia and that is now at risk from climate change and industrial and shipping activities. It is led by three Commissioners: Eva Aariak, the Canadian Commissioner and former Premier of Nunavut; Kuupik Kleist, the Greenland Commissioner and former Greenland Premier; and me, Okalik Eegeesiak, the International Commissioner and ICC Chair. The Commission is mandated to conduct consultations in the communities in Nunavut and Greenland that are closely connected to Piklalasorsuaq. With the support of the Oak Foundation, the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, Oceans North Canada and the World Wildlife Fund, the commissioners have undertaken consultations with Canadian Inuit communities in Grise Fiord, Resolute, Arctic Bay, Pond Inlet and Clyde River, as well as in Northern Greenland, to hear from Inuit on the Greenlandic side of Pikialasorsuaq, including Siorapaluk, Qaanaaq, Savissivik, Kullorsuaq, Nuussuaq and Upemavik. The discussions are designed to facilitate local and regional input, incorporate indigenous knowledge, and recommend an Inuit strategy for safeguarding, monitoring and managing the health of Pikialasorsuaq for future generations.
The Pikialasorsuaq Commission's goal is to provide a body of evidence, key principles and recommendations to insure that Inuit are central to the future of Pikialasorsuaq and that an Inuit vision of the management of the area is implemented. The intricate sophistication of indigenous knowledge and understanding of the region can be mobilized and integrated in multiple, innovative ways. Our northernmost communities rely on Pikialasorsuaq. In the fall of 2016, they participated in hearings and called for Inuit-led management and monitoring of this important marine area. We are developing a framework for an Inuit-led monitoring plan that will ultimately support indigenous knowledge in policy and control as a central concept of Inuit-led management, and further, for Indigenous Protected Areas (IPAs) to serve as a novel and effective approach to self-determination.
We visited both the Canadian high Arctic communities of Grise Fiord and Pond lnlet and heard from knowledge-holders from Resolute Bay, Clyde River and Arctic Bay. We also travelled to Qaanaaq and Siorapaluk—the most northern community in the world—and down along the coast of Melville Bay to the other Greenland settlements that depend on Pikialasorsuaq. Most of the beautiful villages in this region lack airstrips. The sea is their only link to the outside world.
Hunters from all of these communities generously shared with us their knowledge. Recurring themes included: instability, unpredictability, changes in migration patterns, the presence of new species, and open water where there should be ice. They also talk of political change, of artificial borders that separate them from a time not so long ago, when they could still travel across the polynya's great ice arch that connects Umimmat Nunaat (Ellesmere Island) and Greenland, linking these eastern communities of Pikialasorsuaq to the hunting grounds on Ellesmere.
We heard from every community that Inuit are best placed to monitor and manage this region. They want to lead and set the research agenda, study the indicators of change and establish more realistic hunting regulations that will sustain their communities. Once again, Inuit on both sides of the borders are expressing a strong desire for free movement across Pikialasorsuaq, as well as increased cooperation to achieve a common vision for shared resources and lnuit-led management of the polynya. Similar concerns over increased tourism, shipping, fishing, resource exploration and seismic testing are being heard on both sides of Pikialasorsuaq. Most emphatically, Inuit, though divided by national borders, want to rebuild a caretaking regime for the polynya together, as one people from one sea.
For Inuit, the sustainable use of the marine resources and the future of the Arctic Ocean and sea ice is not a luxury—it is life itself; it is about protecting our culture. Inuit are adapting to changes and we will continue to thrive in the changing Arctic. We have much to learn and much to teach the world. We look forward to working with you. We ask that you accept our invitation to discuss issues affecting our land. Our nuna, the Arctic.",,United Nations,,,,United Nations

Oil and Natural Gas Resources of the Arctic
Article by: Hobart M. King, PhD, RPG
An Enormous Undiscovered Resource
The area above the Arctic Circle is underlain by sedimentary basins and continental shelves that hold enormous oil and natural gas resources. Most of this area is poorly explored for oil and natural gas; however, the United States Geological Survey estimates that the Arctic contains approximately 13 percent of the world's undiscovered conventional oil resources and about 30 percent of its undiscovered conventional natural gas resources.
This makes the Arctic an incredibly rich area. It is about the same geographic size as the African continent - about 6% of Earth's surface area - yet it holds an estimated 22 percent of Earth's oil and natural gas resource. [3]
Most of the exploration in the Arctic to-date has taken place on land. This work has resulted in the Prudhoe Bay Oil Field in Alaska, the Tazovskoye Field in Russia and hundreds of smaller fields, many of which are on Alaska's North Slope. Land accounts for about 1/3 of the Arctic's area and is thought to hold about 16% of the Arctic's remaining undiscovered oil and gas resource. [4]
About 1/3 of the Arctic area is continental shelves which have been very lightly explored. The Arctic continental shelves are the largest geographic area on Earth with enormous probable resources that remains virtually unexplored. The remaining 1/3 of the Arctic is deep ocean waters over 500 meters deep, and this area is unexplored. [4]

|Table 1: Arctic area mean estimated undiscovered technically recoverable, conventional oil and natural gas resources for the seven largest Arctic basin provinces. These seven provinces account for about 360 billion barrels oil equivalent or over 87% of the total undiscovered Arctic area resource. [4]|
Arctic Oil and Natural Gas Resource Basins
The United States Geological Survey has estimated the undiscovered technically recoverable conventional oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids resources north of the Arctic Circle to be approximately 412 billion barrels oil equivalent. Their estimates place over 87% of the resource (360 billion barrels oil equivalent) into seven Arctic basin provinces: Amerasian Basin, Arctic Alaska Basin, East Barents Basin, East Greenland Rift Basin, West Greenland-East Canada Basin, West Siberian Basin, and the Yenisey-Khatanga Basin.
These seven Arctic basin provinces are shown on the map at the top of this page, and their resource distributions are presented in Table 1. [4] It is clear from this data that most of the Arctic area resource is natural gas and that the Asian side of the Arctic area has the highest proportion of natural gas and natural gas liquids.
Jurisdiction of the Arctic
Portions of eight countries are situated above the Arctic Circle: Canada, Denmark (via Greenland), Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden, and the United States. Six of them border the Arctic Ocean and thus have a jurisdictional claim to portions of the Arctic seafloor: Canada, Denmark (via Greenland), Iceland, Norway, Russia, and the United States.
Their claims to oil and gas beneath the Arctic Ocean seafloor have historically been determined by unilateral decrees; however, the Law of the Sea Convention provides each country an exclusive economic zone extending 200 miles out from its shoreline. Under certain conditions the exclusive economic zone can be extended out to 350 miles, if a nation can demonstrate that its continental margin extends more than 200 miles beyond its shore. Russia, Canada, and the United States are currently working to define the extent of their continental margin.
This provision has led to some overlapping territorial disputes and disagreements over how the edge of the continental margin is defined and mapped. For example, Russia claims that their continental margin follows the Lomonosov Ridge all the way to the North Pole. In another, both the United States and Canada claim a portion of the Beaufort Sea in an area that is thought to contain significant oil and natural gas resources.
Challenges of Oil & Gas Exploration in the Arctic
The Arctic is a cold, remote, dark, dangerous and expensive place to explore for oil and natural gas. The Arctic's vast oil resource and the high price of oil are what currently attract attention to the Arctic area.
Where ice-free water is available, oil can be produced from a well, placed on a ship and transported to refineries. It can also be transported by pipeline; however, construction of pipelines in the Arctic are projects of enormous difficulty and scale.
Natural gas is much more difficult to transport to market. It has a much lower energy density and must be supercooled to a liquid for movement by sea. This requires a large, complex and expensive facility that takes several years to design, permit and build. Pipeline construction for natural gas encounters the same expenses and problems as those required to transport oil.
Offshore exploration in the Arctic currently targets oil instead of natural gas. The relative ease of transport is what causes companies to favor oil.
Because of these difficulties and expenses, bringing wells into production in the Arctic requires a very large oil or gas field. The large field is necessary to support the infrastructure required to drill the wells and transport products to market. However, once an initial infrastructure is in place, smaller fields can be developed if the existing infrastructure has the capacity to support them.

Why Arctic Exploration is so Expensive
A short list of reasons why oil and gas exploration in the Arctic is so expensive... [3]
- Harsh winter weather requires that the equipment be specially designed to withstand the frigid temperatures.
- On Arctic lands, poor soil conditions can require additional site preparation to prevent equipment and structures from sinking.
- The marshy Arctic tundra can also preclude exploration activities during the warm months of the year.
- In Arctic seas, the icepack can damage offshore facilities, while also hindering the shipment of personnel, materials, equipment, and oil for long time periods.
- Long supply lines from the world's manufacturing centers require equipment redundancy and a larger inventory of spare parts to ensure reliability.
- Limited transportation access and long supply lines reduce the transportation options and increase transportation costs.
- Higher wages and salaries are required to induce personnel to work in the isolated and inhospitable Arctic.
These difficulties make the cost of oil exploration and production in the Arctic to be nearly double the cost of other areas. However, the enormous resource has attracted a lot of oil and gas activity. This will continue into the future. Interest in the Arctic will only increase as oil and natural gas fields in other areas are depleted and the cost of oil and gas rises.

What happens in the Arctic doesn’t stay in the Arctic – changes taking place in the north will have repercussions further south.
While there is widespread awareness of how greenhouse gas emissions drive global climate warming, what is less well known is how emissions of black carbon particles from forest fires, wood stoves, flaring, energy generation and transport, including shipping, contribute to Arctic warming.
Although shipping contributes just 2% of the black carbon emitted in the Arctic, it has a much greater heating impact. When emitted by ships in and near the Arctic, black carbon particles enter the lower levels of the atmosphere, where they remain for under two weeks, absorbing heat.
But it eventually comes to land on snow or ice, black carbon’s warming impact is 7 to 10 times greater, as it reduces the reflectivity (albedo) and continues to absorb heat, accelerating the Arctic melt.
While most anthropogenic sources of black carbon pollution are being reduced in the Arctic, shipping emissions of black carbon have risen globally in the past decade, and in the Arctic by 85% between 2015 and 2019 alone.
With climate warming driving the ongoing loss of multi-season Arctic sea ice, the region is opening up to more shipping traffic; with a five-fold increase is expected by 2050, we can expect that further increases in black carbon emissions from shipping will only further fuel an already accelerating feedback loop.
Mauritius oil spill: questions mount over ship fuel safety
Around the world, ships typically burn the cheapest and dirtiest fuel left over from the oil refining process – heavy fuel oil (HFO), which produces high levels of black carbon when burned. About 7-21% of global shipping’s climate warming impacts can be attributed to black carbon – the remainder being CO2.
In November 2020, the International Maritime Organization (IMO), the UN body which governs shipping, approved a ban on the use and carriage of HFO in the Arctic – a ban that is set to be adopted this June.
Although environmental and Indigenous groups fought for years for the Arctic to be free of HFO, the ban, set to be agreed in June 2021, contains serious loopholes, which, when implemented, will likely translate to minimal reductions in the use and carriage of HFO in 2024.
Meanwhile, current growth in Arctic shipping is likely to lead to an increase in HFO use and carriage in the Arctic between now and mid-2024, when the ban takes effect and further growth by mid-2029, when the loopholes will finally be closed. Under this regime, black carbon emissions will, for now, continue to increase in the Arctic.
When the IMO’s Pollution Prevention and Response Sub-Committee meets on March 22nd for PPR 8, black carbon will be on the agenda. The IMO has been wrestling with what to do with regard to black carbon for over a decade now – but so far has taken no concrete action to reduce emissions.
Scientists push to add “huge” fish trawling emissions to national inventories
During PPR8, IMO member states have the chance to end this stasis. By putting in place regulations that cut emissions of black carbon from shipping the Arctic, the IMO can have a rapid and effective impact on black carbon emissions. The fix is simple – by moving the shipping industry to distillate fuels, such as diesel or marine gas oil (MGO), or other cleaner energy sources, for vessels operating in or near the Arctic, immediately reduce black carbon emissions in the Arctic by around an incredible 44%.
In addition, vessels using diesel or MGO should also be required to install and use particulate filters, as are already required by land-based transport.
Such a move could be led by industry, which would bolster confidence in thesector’s claims of recognition of its climate responsibilities, and is serious about staying the course towards eventual and inevitable decarbonisation.
The bunkering industry, which supplies fuel for shipping, maintains that it has ample supplies of the necessary distillate fuels available in the Arctic to support a migration away from using heavy fuel oil. Ultimately, future international regulation will also be needed to eliminate all emissions of black carbon from shipping, as well as from other sources.
The Clean Arctic Alliance believes that by mandating a switch of fuels, the IMO – and the shipping sector – could win an easy victory by achieving a major cut of black carbon emissions in the Arctic. It would also be a win for the global climate, for the Arctic and the people who depend on its ecosystem for their livelihoods.

Members of Alaska’s congressional delegation have expressed support for the increased focus on the Arctic, the Juneau Empire reported Saturday.
The Navy statement titled “A Blue Arctic” provides an outline of planned operational changes for the military’s sea services in and around Alaska, including the Navy, Coast Guard and Marine Corps.
The services will operate a full range of missions, adapt to Arctic operations and work with local and Indigenous communities to build regional security, the Navy said.
The Navy highlighted the regional strategy as receding sea ice blamed on climate change makes mineral and biological resources more accessible to nations that can exploit them.
Trade routes are expected to open, allowing access to shipping lanes previously closed by sea ice.
New in 2021: Will you be getting orders to an Arctic base?
New locations for the ""strategic Arctic ports"" would have to have capacity for equipment, fuel storage and defense systems and be linked by roads to airports that can support military aircraft.
The U.S. and China have invested in expanded icebreaker fleets to support northern operations, while Russia has expended vast amounts of resources to modernize its northern fleet.
“The coming decades will witness significant changes to the Arctic Region,” the strategy statement said. “Encompassing about six percent of the global surface, a Blue Arctic will have a disproportionate impact on the global economy given its abundance of natural resources and strategic location.”
Republican U.S. Rep. Don Young of Alaska said in a statement that the U.S. must ensure its waters are navigable and the military has the necessary equipment and training “to keep the peace in a rapidly evolving climate.”
“We must remember that the United States is not the only country working to pursue new opportunities in the Arctic — our adversaries are as well,” Young said.
Republican U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan of Alaska said in a statement that the Navy recognizes the critical importance his state has in the region.

Congress has passed a bill authorizing the addition of Coast Guard Polar Security Cutters for use as icebreakers.
While acknowledging the need to evolve U.S. forces in the region, the strategy “lacks some of the urgency needed to drive the development of critical capabilities that are required to effectively compete with our rivals in the Arctic,” Sullivan said.
Sullivan advocates further changes — including making Alaska the home port for one or more Coast Guard icebreakers.

While the temperature has to be verified by experts, if it stands, it will be the hottest temperature ever recorded in the Arctic Circle.
The small Russian town of Verkhoyansk is known for its brutally cold winters and is one of the coldest towns on Earth. However, temperatures in recent months have skyrocketed double digits above average temperatures.
The average high temperature in Verkhoyansk in June is 68°F, meaning this record day was over 30 degrees hotter than average. For reference, the coldest month of the year Verkhoyansk is January where the high is, on average, -44°F. Yes, you read that correct, negative 44 degrees Fahrenheit is the average high temperature in January.
Before this record-breaking high temperature, temperatures in Siberia were, on average, 18 degrees higher than normal in May. This past May broke the record for the hottest May since record keeping.

The Arctic Circle, which is defined as anything above 66.5°N latitude, has experienced more extreme warming as a result of climate change than lower latitudes (tropics).
It is well known that the poles warm faster as a result of climate change. For example, the average increase in temperature on Earth over the past 40 years is 1.44°F. In comparison, the Arctic has warmed by more than 3.5°F during the same period, more than double the global average.
According to NASA’s research, Earth’s poles warm faster than the rest of the planet because of large-scale energy transport from atmospheric processes. The poles receive their heat from atmospheric and oceanic systems pushing heat from the tropics to the poles. As warming continues, these systems are exacerbated, bringing disproportionally more heat to the poles.
Warming is also increased due to the change in reflectivity (albedo) of the poles. As sea and land ice (which is very reflective) melt and reveal rock and vegetation (which is much less reflective) there is a positive feedback loop that causes the surface to warm, melt more ice, become less reflective, and continue on the cycle of warming.
Thus, those living in high latitude countries (Canada, Russia, Scandinavia, etc.) will experience significantly more warming than those living in low latitude countries (Brazil, Indonesia, Ecuador, etc.).
This dramatic warming of the Arctic up to triple-digit temperatures was not expected to happen until 2100 from climate change. But the reality of warming due to climate change has exceeded expectations as warming, particularly in the poles, has caused record-breaking temperatures in the past decade.",,Trevor Nace,Science,,2020-06-22,Forbes

Arctic Competition
Part One: Resource Competition in the Arctic
PUBLISHED ON OCTOBER 13
FP Analytics’ two-part Arctic Competition Power Map provides Insiders with an in-depth breakdown of how melting sea ice is enabling increased commercial activity and geopolitical competition over resources, shipping routes, and territory in the Arctic. In Part I, we visualize how climate change is physically transforming the Arctic, lay out the scale of potential resources that will be made available, and detail the positions and interests of major players in the region. We provide a thorough walk-through of why the region is gaining increasing commercial and geopolitical importance, and explicitly lay out different actors’ interests in the Arctic, from domestic economic development to securing critical supply chain. As new actors such as China establish their presence in the region, nations are forging fresh political and commercial partnerships across a rapidly changing geopolitical landscape. The impacts of these new partnerships will transform the Arctic and create major political fault lines with the potential to spark future conflict and confrontation.
Executive Summary
Rapidly receding sea ice is enabling access to a range of highly valuable resources across the Arctic. In addition to energy reserves, critical minerals, and fisheries, newly opened shipping routes across the Arctic could potentially help to re-route global trade and enable high-speed Internet connectivity between Europe and Asia. The ability to exploit newly available Arctic resources is drawing increasing interest from both commercial and national actors and is enticing nations, such as China and Japan, to pour both political and financial capital into the region.
When oil prices peaked in 2008, it appeared that a race to secure oil resources in the Arctic was inevitable. However, due to a rapid fall in global oil demand and the high cost of oil extraction in the Arctic, development failed to materialize. Instead, the dynamics of resource competition in the Arctic have shifted toward securing critical minerals, exploiting natural gas reserves, and asserting territorial control over recently opened shipping routes along the Arctic coast. Additionally, the entrance of Asian and European Nations into Arctic affairs has dramatically shifted regional geopolitical dynamics.
The admittance of Asian countries—China, Japan, South Korea, India, and Singapore—as Observer states to the Arctic Council in 2013 significantly expanded the geopolitical landscape of the Arctic. As more national interests converge there, new commercial alliances are being forged. China now looks to Russia’s Arctic energy resources as a means to diversify its energy supply, while European nations are eager to partner with Asian nations to develop high-speed Internet and shipping along the Northern Sea Route.
With new players and commercial relationships emerging in the Arctic, there has been an attendant increase in international tensions. Strengthening commercial ties between Asian and European nations, and deepening levels of Chinese investment across the region—coupled with Russia’s emerging primacy—are generating pushback from the U.S. In May of 2019, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo directly called out Chinese and Russian activities in the Arctic as threats to U.S. national interests and security. Moreover, the wider uncoupling of the U.S. and Chinese economies are making the Arctic an arena of great power competition.
Growing tensions over control of critical minerals that are essential to modern technologies, disputed shipping routes, and Chinese entrenchment across the Arctic are also putting pressure on the region’s governance framework. Consisting of an amalgamation of governance organizations and treaties, the region’s governance structures are not designed to contain or mitigate potential great power conflicts. An escalation between the U.S. and China or Russia would divide the region and significantly harm cooperative efforts toward environmental preservation and mitigation of climate change.
Part I of FP Analytics’ Arctic Competition Power Map breaks down key emerging trends across the Arctic by:
- Mapping access and control of key resource bases;
- Breaking down the public- and private-sector actors collaborating and competing for Arctic access and influence;
- Projecting the key points of geopolitical tension and the relative power positions of the actors involved; and,
- Outlining the legal landscape and governance structures in place to mitigate conflict across the region.
FP Analytics’ Arctic Competition Power Map is a powerful tool for businesses and others seeking to understand how emerging great power competition across the Arctic will help shape and influence the wider geopolitical landscape. Part II will map out Russian and NATO military activities in the Arctic and will explore materializing national security risks.

PART ONE Resource Competition In The Arctic
Introduction
Climate change has impacted the Arctic more than any other region in the world, with changes in surface temperatures increasing between two and three degrees over the last fifty years. Rising temperatures are rapidly changing the Arctic’s physical geography and allowing increased access to an immense untapped resource base of 13 percent of the world’s oil reserves, nearly 30 percent of its natural gas, a wide range of critical minerals, and fisheries accounting for 10 percent of the global catch. Melting ice is also freeing up new shipping routes among Asia, Europe, and the U.S., cutting down average shipping times between Europe and Asia from thirty-seven days to twenty-two, and shipping times from the U.S. to Asia from forty-three days to thirty-two. Resource accessibility and expansion of commercial shipping routes are increasing the Arctic’s commercial and strategic importance, as national governments and private industry move to secure greater influence in the region.
For national governments, there are both strong incentives to cooperate on trade and investment across the Arctic, as well as emerging disputes over territory and alliances that are heightening tensions—particularly among geopolitical superpowers, notably Russia, China, and the United States. Russia’s position as the largest and most economically active Arctic state, and China’s growing investment in Russian infrastructure and energy projects in the region are fueling competition and potential conflict. For Russia, the Arctic represents a critical pillar for its economic development, with billions of dollars’ worth energy and mineral resources for domestic use and export, and a means to expand its international influence through control of critical shipping routes between Asia and Europe. To date, Russia has been the nation most heavily invested in Arctic development, and many in Europe and Asia are reliant on Russian natural gas exports, which are predominantly extracted there.
Notably, China has partnered extensively with Russia, as both an importer of Russian natural gas and an investor in infrastructure development along the Northern Sea Route (NSR), which could give China access to shorter shipping routes to Europe, saving billions of dollars in shipping costs and strengthening commercial ties to Europe. The opening of the NSR would also benefit Europe, granting easier access to China—its second-largest commercial trade market—and paving the way for high-speed digital connectivity between the two continents by way of submarine Internet cables along the NSR seabed. While not commonly reported, undersea Internet cables will play a crucial role in spurring future tech-based industrial growth in the Arctic, as well as in boosting Arctic nations’ defense capabilities by enabling the monitoring of both the Arctic seabed and cyberspace communications. For the U.S., there is potential to access a range of resources, including critical minerals such as rare earths, copper, and phosphorus. Beyond the potential for resource extraction, the U.S. government views the Arctic as an arena for countering Russian and Chinese international influence and is now seeking to establish a stronger presence in the region for deterrence, as articulated in the Pentagon’s June 2019 Department of Defense Arctic Strategy report to Congress.
As these resource plays and global trends play out, competition in the Arctic is set to be a multi-dimensional and evolving power struggle with commercial and geopolitical implications. In Part I of this two-part Power Map series, we break down the current state of this competition, outline how different actors are positioning themselves, and explore the implications for companies, national governments and the environment.
The Impact of Climate Change and Rapidly Expanding Access to Arctic Resources
While there is no universally agreed-upon definition of what territory constitutes the Arctic, it is generally understood to be the northernmost part of the Earth that lies above the 66°33′ north latitude line in the region referred to as the “Arctic Circle.” This region has played a number of historically significant roles, from Britain’s early attempts to find the Northwest Passage, to Russia’s militarization of the Arctic throughout the Cold War. Today, the impacts of climate change are making this region more critical to global commerce and geopolitics than ever as sea ice melt rapidly degrades natural habitats within the Arctic and makes abundant natural resources more readily available. Russia, China, the U.S., Europe, and other nations are intensifying their focus on the Arctic. Apart from Europe, these three other global powers have each released updated Arctic strategy policy documents in the past three years and have recently deployed commercial, scientific, and/or military expeditions in the Arctic. The large stores of oil, natural gas, minerals, and fisheries held in the Arctic are becoming increasingly accessible, drawing interest from national actors and private industry, while generating pushback from conservation groups that hope to prevent further exploitation of the region and its Indigenous peoples.
Key Takeaways
The Issue
The Arctic today provides an estimated $281 billion worth of food, minerals, oil, and gas, and climate change is set to increase the economic opportunities across these industries as well as provide new commercial shipping routes. The promise of these resources is attracting national and private interests to the Arctic while threatening Indigenous communities and local ecosystems.
The Reaction
The abundant resources held in the Arctic have generated interest from myriad commercial and national actors looking to seize on and strengthen regional energy, food, and technology supply chains. These resources include roughly a quarter of the world’s untapped and accessible energy resources, fisheries that currently generate an average of $560 million annually and are set to increase up to thirty-seven times in size due to climate-driven migration, and an estimated two trillion dollars’ worth of minerals held in the Russian Arctic alone.
What’s at Stake
Commercial industry stands to gain access to billions of dollars’ worth of resources—in the forms of oil, natural gas, critical minerals, and fisheries—while increased economic activity in the Arctic will simultaneously accelerate sea ice melt, ocean acidification, and rising temperatures. The economic potential the Arctic holds is also aggravating political tensions among Arctic nations, Indigenous populations, and environmental groups. While resource extraction in the Arctic is still costly and potentially dangerous due to an inhospitable environment, the increasing global demand for critical minerals and seafood supplies provided by fisheries continues to drive investment into the region.

- GRAPHIC 2: Arctic Timeline
- GRAPHIC 3: Oil And Gas Basins In The Arctic
Changes in surface temperatures in the Arctic are more significant than anywhere else in the world, increasing by two to three degrees over the last fifty years, leading to a drastic reduction in sea ice covering the Arctic in both the winter and summer months, at an average rate of 12.9 percent per year. Record low extents of sea ice were recorded in 2012, with 2019’s sea ice extent being the second lowest recorded since 1979. At its current rate of decline, current projections put the Arctic as being ice-free in most late summers as soon as the 2030s. The rapid decline of Arctic sea ice is drawing commercial and national interests towards the Arctic, looking to exploit both its natural resources and new shipping routes that are opening through the region. In the summer of 2020, the two most important shipping routes through the Arctic—the Northern Sea Route and the Northwest Passage—were open and ice-free for weeks. The Northern Sea Route would connect China and Europe, and potentially reroute shipping trade from the Suez Canal. It is critical to Russia’s plans to develop the Arctic, as well as China’s aspirations there.
Despite the allure of vast resources and potential for increased trade and investment between continents, some Arctic resources are still exceedingly difficult to access. For example, multibillion-dollar energy investments from Cairn Energy, in 2014, and Shell, in 2017, yielded no oil—and a precipitous fall in the price of oil since 2014 has made this type of high-cost, high-risk investment increasingly unattractive. Access challenges and low market prices have changed the calculus and are deterring oil exploration in the Arctic, but geopolitics and increased global demand continue to drive investment in natural gas and mineral exploitation.
China’s voracious energy consumption continues to drive its investment in Russian Arctic energy supplies. China has been the largest contributor to global energy consumption growth every year since 2000, accounting for 24 percent of global energy consumption in 2018, and despite its economic slowdown, diversifying energy supplies from the Arctic remains a strategic imperative. Growing demand for resources is catalyzing Chinese investment in the region more broadly, and Arctic nations are eager to capitalize on these capital inflows. The competitive dynamics of the Arctic’s major natural-resource bases are broken down below.

Energy: Russia Capitalizing on Natural Gas Reserves While Oil Fails to Attract Investment
Energy companies have a long history of Arctic activity, starting with the discovery of oil in Siberia by the Soviet Union in 1962. However, climate change, new technologies, and a 2008 report by the United States Geological Survey—estimating that the Arctic contained nearly one-quarter of the earth’s undiscovered recoverable petroleum resources—ushered in a new era of oil prospecting in the region with nineteen major oil and gas companies active in the Arctic, including BP, ExxonMobil, and Shell. However, commercial oil competition has failed to materialize due to disappointing returns on investment, as none of the fourteen offshore oil wells drilled in the Arctic has yielded economically profitable quantities of oil. Global oil and gas price declines of over 50 percent since 2014 have made the cost and difficulty of extracting oil an economically unfeasible investment. Natural gas extraction still plays a critical role in Arctic development for Russia, Norway, and Canada, but global commodity prices, coupled with the U.S. shale revolution, which has increased U.S. oil and gas production 57 percent since 2010, have deterred extensive natural gas investment by most Arctic nations and outside commercial interests.
For Russia, natural gas represents the backbone of its economic and geopolitical future. It is the world’s second-largest producer of natural gas (after the U.S.) and Europe’s largest natural gas supplier, with fourteen European countries importing more than 50 percent of their natural gas from Russia. Production is concentrated in the Arctic, with roughly 85 percent coming from northern West Siberia in Russia’s Arctic. Russia’s strategic geographic position allows it to supply natural gas directly to Europe and Asia, which it is leveraging to develop two major gas pipelines—the Nord Stream 2 (connecting to Europe) and the Power of Siberia (connecting to China). The Power of Siberia gas pipeline began directly supplying China with Russian natural gas reserves in 2019 and is a key point of cooperation between the two countries in the Arctic. While other Asian countries such as Japan and South Korea have also invested in Russian natural gas, the closer economic ties between China and Russia are the focus of growing geopolitical concern, heightening energy security risks among European importers and U.S. natural gas exporters.

The signing of the Ottawa Declaration by the eight Arctic states (Russia, Canada, the U.S., Norway, Iceland, Denmark (Greenland), Sweden, Finland) officially creates the Arctic Council. As the central international organization for Arctic cooperation and governance, the Arctic Council is designed to address common regional issues related to environmental protection and sustainable development. However, it does not address issues related to fishing and military security. In addition to the eight Arctic Nations, the organization includes six Indigenous peoples’ groups, named the “Permanent Participants,” and twelve non-Arctic observer states. Read more

Oil And Gas Basins In The Arctic
The major discovered and accessible oil and gas basins in the Arctic are mapped below.
Minerals: Critical Minerals Set to Drive Future Investment from the U.S., China, and Russia
Mining represents the leading and most valuable economic sector in the Arctic. Abundant and significant deposits of zinc, iron ore, silver, lead, nickel, copper, coal, gold, uranium, tungsten, diamonds, rare-earth elements, and other critical minerals remain untapped. Russia has the largest mineral extraction operations in the Arctic—and holds an estimated $1.5 to 2 trillion worth of unmined mineral reserves—with Canada and the U.S. also engaging in extensive mining operations. Interest in mineral resources is intensifying, particularly due to their essential roles in a range of advanced technologies. Since the early 2000s, strong demand for zinc, iron ore, copper, silver, lead, and diamonds, notably from developing Asian economies—has pushed up prices and drawn in prospectors. Attention is now turning to previously inaccessible rare-earth elements, key inputs for the manufacturing of modern technologies from smart phones to defense applications.
While energy investments draw Russia and China closer, the dynamics over minerals are more nuanced. Russia’s state-owned Far East Development Fund is creating a $1 billion joint mining venture fund with China National Gold Group, a government-controlled producer of the precious metals. At the same time, Russia is pushing to end its reliance on China for rare earths—Russia plans to invest $1.5 billion over the next ten years to become “self-sufficient,” a goal similarly articulated by the U.S. However, China dominates rare-earth elements’ production and global supply chains, and its position will be difficult to challenge. It is currently home to 63 percent of global production of these elements and is heavily investing in mining activities across the Arctic (and elsewhere around the globe). Despite U.S. ambitions, it lacks the processing capabilities to refine rare earths domestically and relies on China for 80 percent of its rare earth supply, with China continuing to wield the valuable resources as geostrategic weapons. In May of 2019, China threatened to cut off rare earth supplies to the U.S. due to mounting trade tensions, driving the Pentagon (once again) to seek alternatives. As these and other countries around the world seek to ramp up their rare earth and other critical minerals production, the Arctic will become an arena for that competition.
Fisheries: Warming Oceans Enabling Rampant Exploitation of Arctic Fisheries
A central industry for many Arctic nations, regional fisheries also represent a coveted resource for global food supply. Fishing represents 90 percent and 40 percent of Greenland’s and Iceland’s exports, respectively, and industrial fishing is booming as warming ocean environments globally drive northern migration of fish species toward cooler waters, and melting ice opens access to new fisheries. The vast fishing potential in unclaimed Arctic waters has attracted interest from China, which consumes seafood at twice the average global per capita rate. Fears that overfishing in the Arctic Ocean would accelerate climate change and endanger food supplies for local and Indigenous populations prompted an international agreement banning commercial fishing for sixteen years. The agreement—reached in 2017 among nine nations (Russia, Canada, the U.S., Norway, Denmark, Iceland, China, Japan, and South Korea) and the EU—covers the entire Arctic Ocean. However, lack of policing and strong financial incentives have enabled rampant illegal fishing, costing nations an estimated $15.5 billion annually. As global food insecurity intensifies, demand for, and competition over, these coveted resources is set to increase.
Arctic Governance and Positioning of Power Players
Overlapping organizational mandates, treaties, and conventions complicate Arctic governance. The patchwork nature of Arctic governance is not effectively designed to constrain great power competition, and China’s entrance into the Arctic—as well as the U.S.’s increased focus on the region—are putting pressure on this framework. In the absence of a more coherent and collaborative governance structure, national interests prevail, with outside forces leveraging bilateral relationships to achieve their aims and strengthen their footholds in the region. The current governance framework has increased cooperation among Arctic states on issues such as climate change, Indigenous rights, and scientific research. However, it is ill-equipped to resolve economic disputes between the U.S. and China, or a potential military escalation between the U.S. and Russia.
Key Takeaways
The Issue
A fragmented Arctic governance framework, the Trump administration’s strategic prioritization to counter Russian and Chinese influence in the Arctic, and increasing tensions among the U.S., China, and Russia could further disrupt commercial investments. While a patchwork governance framework of international standards, laws, and treaties has proven effective at resolving small-scale Arctic disputes to date, it is ill-equipped to mitigate a major escalation or confrontation between great powers.
The Reaction
China cemented its status as an Arctic Observer state on the Arctic Council in 2013 and has continued to expand both its political and economic influence in the region ever since. In May of 2019, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo openly condemned Chinese and Russian Arctic activities along the Northern Sea Route at an Arctic Council meeting, citing competing territorial claims. The U.S.’s increasingly hostile relationships with China and Russia are challenging Arctic governance structures and diverting focus from cooperation on climate change and research.
What’s at Stake
Future access to Arctic resources, shipping routes, and territorial claims. National governments and companies that establish their positions in the Arctic now are likely to influence the reorientation of trade and balance of power in the region. However, competing strategic interests and visions for development in the region could imperil future collaborative governance, which would risk necessary cooperation on trade and development in the region.

- GRAPHIC 5: National Economic Interests and Geopolitical Positions
Established in 1996, the Arctic Council is the main international body for regional cooperation in the region and, to date, has served as an effective government mechanism for promoting coordination and cooperation across Arctic states and Observers. Consisting of eight permanent member states and thirteen Observer states, the Council is the primary governance body through which disputes over territorial claims, environmental standards, and relations with Indigenous communities take place. It provides a forum for dialogue and cooperation and has brought Arctic nations together to sign on to numerous international agreements, such as the Agreement on Enhancing International Arctic Scientific Cooperation, signed in 2017.
However, the Arctic Council is only one of many regional governance structures—including the Barents Euro-Arctic Council, the Nordic Council, and the Baltic Sea Council—and international treaties governing the Arctic. While the current governance structure has proved adept at navigating existing legal, economic, and scientific disputes in the Arctic, it is coming under increasing pressure as states outside of the Arctic’s geographic boundaries seek greater commercial and political influence. The growing list of Arctic Observer states eager to assert themselves in the region—such as China, India, and Japan—and exogenous events impacting great power competition are putting pressure on the existing governance structure that it may be ill-equipped to handle.
The 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) is the international legal framework governing offshore activities in the Arctic Ocean. Critical to resource control and management, UNCLOS establishes exclusive economic zones (EEZs) up to 200 miles offshore for each littoral Arctic nation and sets rules for extending continental shelf rights up to 350 miles offshore. Under the convention, each nation is granted control over all living and non-living resources within its EEZ, and the 1.1 million square miles of Arctic Ocean beyond any nations’ EEZs are considered outside of national control. Among the Arctic states, the U.S. is the only member that has not officially ratified UNCLOS, so it is excluded from submitting territorial claims of its continental shelf to the U.N. While UNCLOS establishes control over the majority of Arctic resources, disputes persist over control of key shipping routes—sovereignty over both the Northern Sea Route and the Northwest Passage is contested—and competition for resources such as fisheries and critical minerals is exceedingly difficult to regulate.
China’s presence, in particular, could upset the current governance framework and delicate balance of power. Having joined the Arctic Council as an Observer in 2013, China does not have Arctic territory or historical treaties with the other Arctic states. Nevertheless, its multibillion-dollar investments across all five of the littoral Arctic states and its admittance to the Arctic Council as an Observer state are cementing its increasingly powerful presence in the region. Expanding interests from other non-Arctic states, as well as geopolitical developments outside of the region, are reshaping Arctic relations, with the potential to further disrupt commercial cooperation there. To help explain these evolving dynamics, the key economic interests, and Arctic policies of each of the Arctic littoral nations, as well as other key nations with Arctic interests, are broken down below.

Country Profiles And Policies
Scroll below for a breakdown of key Arctic players’ economic and geopolitical interests and relative strengths in the region. (Note: China is an Observer to the Arctic Council.)
Russia
The development of the Arctic is central to Russia’s economic and geopolitical fate. Russia has the most Arctic territory and coastline, population, and natural resource reserves, and it plans to invest $231 billion in Arctic oil and gas development. Russia is heavily invested in oil and gas exploration and production and mineral extraction and is actively carving out shipping routes and laying digital infrastructure for submarine Internet connectivity. Continued Russian investment across these sectors is critical to the economic development of Russia and of the region as a whole.
Oil and gas exports have enabled strong commercial and coercive ties with Europe for over fifty years. While more recently establishing itself as key natural gas supplier to Asia in 2018, Russia is increasingly attracting investment from China, Japan, and South Korea. For these partnerships to thrive, Russia needs to further develop its existing Arctic infrastructure to access additional natural gas reserves, 95 percent of which are still untapped. Russia is also the critical actor in developing the Northern Sea Route (NSR) for trade and submarine Internet connectivity through undersea fiberoptic cables, activities that are attracting investment from both European and Asian countries. Successful development of the NSR would potentially make Russia critical to global trade and communications between Asia and Europe, strengthening Russia’s commercial ties and political leverage on both continents.
Russia’s resource exports to Europe and China and the country’s role pioneering development of the Northern Sea Route make it the most commercially connected and important Arctic nation. Given its heavy dependence on the Arctic for its own future power supply—not to mention its status as a global supplier, Russia has the most to gain or lose from Arctic economic development. The centrality of Russia’s role in the Arctic makes its contentious relationships with the U.S. and Europe a key point of Arctic tensions. Russia’s annexation Crimea in 2014 and the subsequent U.S. sanctions on Russia’s energy, financial, and defense sectors forced ExxonMobil out of Russia’s Arctic in 2018. Russia’s military buildup in the Arctic and its assertion of sovereign control of the Northern Sea Route continue to fuel U.S. backlash. However, Russia’s centrality to Arctic development for other Arctic nations notably limits U.S. leverage and is unlikely to deter continued international investment in Russia’s Arctic development projects.
United States
A deepening of U.S. engagement in the Arctic began in 2009, under the Obama administration, which focused on climate change as the primary U.S. security challenge in the Arctic. The administration’s climate-focused efforts culminated in National Security Presidential Directive 66, focused on environmental preservation, scientific research, and international collaboration. The U.S. has held considerable economic clout in the region as well, with the state of Alaska accounting for 10.8 percent of the gross regional product produced in the entirety of the Arctic—the second largest economy in the region. However, its economic power is waning, as the low price of oil and the shale revolution continue to take their tolls.
U.S. commercial and strategic interests also extend to critical minerals located in the Arctic. In September of 2020, President Trump released an executive order calling for the U.S. to end its reliance on foreign supply chains of critical minerals. To do that, the U.S. would need to rebuild its domestic processing capability to efficiently exploit and process most critical mineral reserves. Rebuilding these processing capabilities will make Arctic critical minerals deposits significantly more important to the U.S.
Under the Trump administration, however, focus has shifted to Russian and Chinese deterrence in the region, as outlined in the Pentagon’s June 2019 Department of Defense Arctic Strategy report to Congress. President Trump’s June 2020 Memorandum on Safeguarding U.S. Interests in the Arctic called for a review of Arctic icebreaking capabilities and an upgrade on the country’s currently diminished fleet of polar icebreakers by 2029. Three new icebreakers are now being commissioned; once completed, they will compliment two existing icebreakers (which are over forty years old and not suitable for most Arctic missions). These investments, however, will not generate near-term returns, as developing these ships will take years and billions of dollars, and American capabilities will still pale in comparison to Russia’s fleet of thirty-eight, leaving the U.S. far behind Russia in its ability to navigate Arctic waters for scientific, commercial, or military aims.
Due to its relative underinvestment in the region, the U.S. is unlikely to be able to compete economically with either Russia or China in the region. Relative underinvestment in economic development and environmental efforts is diminishing U.S. soft power in the region, making the U.S.’s efforts to curb Russian and Chinese development of the Arctic difficult to enforce. Nevertheless, the U.S. has had some limited success subverting Chinese investment in Greenland and has effectively raised alarms to some other European nations, such as Norway, that are also concerned with the extent of Russian and Chinese presence in the Arctic.
Canada
Canada’s Arctic is home to over 100,000 people, and territory 40 percent of the country’s landmass is located above the Arctic Circle. Arctic economic development is a key domestic policy issue in Canada, while the international focus has been on cooperation. While Canada continually emphasizes cooperation, its economic ties to China, scientific cooperation with Russia, and territorial disputes with the U.S. and Greenland are all sources of international tension. Canada has welcomed extensive Chinese investment, most notably the “Plan Nord,” an $80 billion, twenty-five-year development plan in Quebec. Chinese companies also maintain a presence in mineral extraction and shipping along the Northwest Passage. Canada claims sovereignty over this shipping route, while the U.S. maintains that it is in international waters. This dispute mirrors the territorial debate between Russia and the U.S. over the Northern Sea Route, with Canada sharing Russia’s legal perspective on the Northern Sea Route, positioning itself in opposition to the U.S. in both instances. Additionally, Canada has a scientific partnership with Russia in the Arctic and has not demonstrated similar levels of concern as the U.S. over Russian and Chinese Arctic activities.
Denmark (Greenland)
Greenland’s small population of just 56,025, reliance on Denmark for two-thirds of its budget, and lack of military power make it one of the weaker players in the Arctic. However, Greenland’s abundant mineral resources and its need for outside investment are placing it at the center of Arctic debates. Greenland has abundant mineral and energy resource reserves, but it has been unable to develop them economically. Oil exploration has yielded few results, and fisheries remain essential for Greenland’s economy, accounting for over 90 percent of exports. Greenland has turned to tourism and foreign investment in mining to drive its economy. In 2012, China’s minister of land and resources made an initial prospecting visit, and since then Greenland has welcomed Chinese investment in mining and infrastructure development, and China has maintained a strong presence in Greenland since 2016. Seeking to limit Chinese influence in the region, the U.S. and the Danish government successfully blocked Chinese development of three airports in 2019 and the purchase of an abandoned naval base in 2016. Of strategic military importance to the U.S., Greenland is the location of the U.S.’s Northern-most military base, and Chinese presence in Greenland is emerging as a major point of concern for U.S. security forces in the region. In 2019, President Donald Trump suggested that the U.S. purchase Greenland outright. Greenland’s abundant mineral resources, including rare earths, and its history as a U.S. military outpost in the Arctic make it a potential arena for continued confrontation between the U.S. and China in the Arctic.
Iceland
Iceland’s borders place it geographically outside of the Arctic Circle, denying it territorial rights in the Arctic Ocean under United Nations Convention for the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). Still, the country is heavily reliant on fishing in the Arctic Ocean, which accounts for 27 percent of GDP. As the chair of the Arctic Council since 2019, Iceland has made preserving the ocean environment and gaining territorial rights in the Arctic Ocean top international policy priorities. Iceland’s economy was one of the hardest hit during the 2008 financial crisis, and the lack of offshore oil development has slowed its recovery. To boost its economy, Iceland has turned to exporting geothermal and hydroelectric energy and developing a domestic tourism industry, which grew to account for 7 percent of GDP in 2018. Additionally, Iceland has opened economic ties to China, signing a bilateral energy accord in 2012 and a free trade agreement the following year. Since 2012, Iceland has welcomed $1.2 billion in Chinese investment, accounting for 6 percent of Iceland’s GDP from 2012 to 2017. Accompanying China’s investments, Iceland has also lent China access to scientific facilities, geothermal energy expertise, and telecommunications infrastructure. China’s growing presence, combined with recent Russian aggression toward Iceland—including two Russian bombers entering NATO airspace near Iceland twice—led to visits from both U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and U.S. Vice President Mike Pence in 2020. While Iceland is deepening economic ties with China, its diplomatic relationship with Russia is tense, having deteriorated following NATO sanctions over Russia’s annexation of Crimea.
Finland
Finland was the most recent chair of the Arctic Council (prior to Iceland), from 2017 to 2019. During its chairmanship, Finland focused on strengthening ties between the EU and the Arctic Council and pursuing cooperative climate change mitigation strategies. With well-developed infrastructure above the Arctic Circle, including airports, heavy industry in forestry, mining, renewable and bioenergy, and metal industries, Finland represents a strong actor in the region and a desirable economic and strategic partner—with Finland and Russia already closely aligned. Russia is Finland’s third largest trading partner, and its leading shipbuilding industry makes it an attractive partner to work alongside Russia in developing the Northern Sea Route. The two countries are working on developing polar icebreakers and are collaborating on developing shipping ports and submarine Internet cables along the Northern Sea Route. Finland is one of the six EU states that are not NATO members, and its close relationship with Russia and willingness to collaborate with China make it unlikely that Finland would support increasing U.S. efforts to block those countries’ increasingly assertive development in the region.
Norway
Nearly 10 percent of Norway’s population lives above the Arctic circle, the greatest proportion of any Arctic country. Norway has extensive economic interests in the Arctic, which is a key resource base for future economic development. The Arctic contains an estimated 43 percent of Norway’s remaining undiscovered oil and gas resources and provides 33 percent of the country’s mining activity, and 80 percent of total Arctic shipping volume passes through Norway. Arctic tourism has also emerged as an attractive source of revenue, seeing a 206 percent increase from 2006 through 2013. Building on its strong base, Norway is heavily invested in further developing the Arctic, allocating 40 billion NOK (4.4 billion USD) to infrastructure development and 24.5 billion NOK (2.7 billion USD) to business development since 2016.
Norway’s growth and development agenda would be undermined from increased geopolitical tensions in the region, and international cooperation is the country’s primary foreign policy priority in the Arctic. With strong commercial ties to Russia, and being a NATO member state, Norway is effectively positioned to act as a de-escalator between the U.S. and Russia. It has pursued multilateral cooperation with Russia through international and regional organizations such as the UN and the Arctic Council, and it has collaborated with the U.S. and other NATO allies to deter increased Russian military presence in the Arctic.
China
China became an Arctic Observer state on the Arctic Council in 2013 and has since dramatically increased its Arctic activities. From 2012 to 2017, China invested over $435 billion across all five of the Arctic littoral states, and it has conducted extensive scientific and commercial voyages, including multiple navigations of the Northern Sea Route by the state-owned China Ocean Shipping Company. Further cementing its presence in the Arctic, China has also forged research partnerships with Iceland, Greenland, Norway, and Russia. From 2017 to 2019, Chinese officials began development on a polar research base and a satellite ground station for climate change research in Greenland, a research station in Iceland to study space weather, a research station on Norway’s Svalbard Island, and a research center in Russia to forecast ice conditions along the Northern Sea Route. This influx of Chinese investment has provided a critical resource for Arctic economic development and furthering scientific understanding of the region. However, it has also been a major cause of tension in the region, as the U.S. has repeatedly singled out Chinese Arctic activity as a security concern.
A strategic region within China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), officials have deemed it the “Polar Silk Road,” with sweeping BRI plans aiming to connect Asia with Africa and Europe via land and maritime networks in order to re-route global trade and stimulate economic growth. China plans to invest an estimated $1 trillion to $8 trillion into the BRI initiative overall, primarily on ports, roads, railways, airports, power plants and telecommunications networks. So far, its investments in the Arctic have reflected these priorities. For example, China is collaborating with Finland to develop the Talsinki tunnel, an undersea rail tunnel between Helsinki and Tallinn meant to eventually route trade from Europe to China through the Northern Sea Route. Additionally, China has invested extensively in mining and energy, reflecting efforts to strengthen and diversify its resource supply chains. In this respect, the Arctic is likely to become increasingly important to China, as the region contains the energy resources to fuel China’s economy, the critical minerals key to its advanced technology ambitions, and abundant seafood supplies to meet domestic demand. China’s deepening commercial interests and partnerships in the Arctic, are set to further inflame tensions with the U.S. and make the regional a focal point for intensifying geopolitical competition.
Emerging Arctic Geopolitical Competition and Cooperation
Competition for Arctic resources, particularly critical minerals and natural gas, is shaping geopolitics in the region, but direct military confrontation over resources has not yet materialized. Economic tensions in the Arctic today are largely manifesting from China’s investments in the region, Russia’s commercial partnerships and militarization, and territorial disputes. China invested $450 billion in the Arctic from 2012 through 2017, across all of the Arctic nations. Chinese investment is driving development of the Northern Sea Route, for both shipping and submarine Internet connectivity. In addition to creating stronger commercial ties between China and Russia, this development would strengthen Russia’s claim of sovereign control over the NSR, which the U.S. still disputes. The Arctic’s geographic position among the U.S., Russia, and Europe makes it a de facto location for competition to play out among these powers, and Russia’s and China’s investment ambitions are making the region a focal point of competition between great powers.
Key Takeaways
The Issue
China’s extensive investments across the region are providing funding for the development of the Northern Sea Route and submarine Internet cables connecting Europe and Asia via Russia. The extent of Chinese FDI—and its critical role in Russian development of the Arctic and the Northern Sea Route—is the major point of friction driving U.S. intervention in the region today.
The Reaction
The U.S. is leading the pushback against China’s increased Arctic presence and its economic partnerships with Russia. Having openly condemned China’s and Russia’s Arctic activities, the U.S. has pressured countries into canceling Chinese-funded commercial projects and has cited Chinese activity as a key catalyst for its renewed focus on the Arctic.
What’s at Stake
Chinese investments provide billions of dollars in funding for Arctic economic development, with several nations courting investors to shore up local economies. Chinese investment is critical to developing Arctic infrastructure and access resources, and U.S. efforts to deter China’s regional presence will be highly divisive among Arctic nations.
- GRAPHIC 6: Chinese Investment In The Arctic
- GRAPHIC 7: Potential Shipping Routes
As the nation with the most Arctic territory, population, and investments, Russia represents the dominant player in the Arctic today, but its stature is being propped up by nearly $200 billion in Chinese investment—the most China has invested in any country. Development of the NSR is key to Russia’s control of the Arctic in the future and will potentially re-route trade from Europe to China through Russian waters. However, the U.S. has disputed Russian control of the Northern Sea Route for over fifty years, with that battle intensifying over Chinese involvement. Additionally, Chinese investments in the development of submarine Internet cable along the NSR (built in part by Huawei Marine), which would provide a high-speed Internet connection between Europe and China—are ratcheting up tensions given the U.S.’s prolonged and deepening fight to keep Chinese telecommunications technology, and specifically Huawei, out of Europe. The development of submarine Internet cables between Europe and China is likely to incite further pushback from the U.S., which has already worked with the Danish government to push Chinese investments in airport infrastructure out of Greenland and cancelled domestic Chinese investments in natural gas development. The scope of China’s Arctic investments and its impacts on future development of the Northern Sea Route for shipping and Internet connectivity are broken down below.
China Is Heavily Invested Across the Arctic, Driving Development and Controversy
Amid the global economic downturn and plummeting commodity prices, many Arctic nations, particularly Russia, Finland, Greenland, and Iceland, depend increasingly on foreign direct investment (FDI). To date, China is by far the largest foreign investor in the region—investing $1.4 trillion into the Arctic from 2005 through 2017 across a wide range of sectors. Chinese investments include billions of dollars in energy extraction in northern Russia, prospecting for minerals in Greenland, and a sealed strategic joint venture between Huawei Marine and the Finnish company Cinia Oy to build a submarine communication cable along the Northern Sea Route linking Europe and Asia. From 2012 through 2017, China invested in over 281 projects in Russia, with an average investment of $691.7 million per project. While other countries have made major investments in the Arctic—France and Japan are both co-investors in Russia’s LNG pipeline —China is by far the most active, with 884 projects. Recent Chinese investments, in particular, have been spurring heavy international pushback from the U.S. and Europe, given concern that Chinese investment in the Arctic is strengthening ties to Russia.
In 2019, planned Chinese investment in three Greenland airports was cancelled after the U.S. pressured the Danish government to intervene and cancel the contracts citing security concerns. Until 2017, the U.S. (primarily Alaska) was the second-largest Arctic investment market for China. Since then, that relationship is increasingly under strain due to mounting U.S.-China tensions over trade, intellectual property rights, and territorial claims. In response to the Trump Administration’s 2018 tariffs on Chinese goods, China placed retaliatory tariffs on Pacific Northwest seafood—Alaska’s largest export to China—endangering future economic relations. In July of 2019, Alaskan governor Mike Dunleavy scrapped a $43 billion natural gas pipeline deal between a private U.S. company and three state-owned Chinese companies signed in 2017. In his 2019 speech to the Arctic Council, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo specifically called increasing Chinese presence and strengthening Russian and Chinese ties as threats to U.S. and Arctic security.
Notable Private Sector and SOE Activity:
- Chinese company General Nice Group purchased a Greenland iron ore mine in 2015.
- Huawei Marine invested in building a submarine Internet cable along the Northern Sea Route in 2016.
- The China National Petroleum Corporation and China Silk Road Fund invested in the Yamal LNG project developed by Russia’s Novatek in 2016.
However, given the precarity of their economies, particularly in the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis, both Greenland and Iceland welcomed Chinese investment. From 2012 through 2017, Chinese FDI in Greenland and Iceland accounted for 11.6 percent and 5.7 percent of overall GDP, respectively. In 2012 Greenland passed the Large-Scale Projects Act, which grants foreign workers rights in Greenland and creates a pathway for more Chinese workers to immigrate to Greenland. Investment in the Arctic is also a critical source of employment for Greenland, where unemployment rates reached as high as 10.3 percent in 2014. However, weak or unenforceable labor regulations in the Arctic mean that there is no oversight to ensure that companies extracting resources from the Arctic adhere to environmental standards. The increase of Chinese and Russian companies in the region, with no mechanisms to hold foreign companies responsible for environmental disasters, has raised concerns among a number of environmental organizations. Nevertheless, Chinese investment is critical to the continued development of the region. Private investment in extractive industries has not provided the expected economic boost for most Arctic nations, and China’s willingness to provide state-backed investment capital is key for commercial development across Greenland, Iceland, Finland, and Russia.

With Help from China, the Northern Sea Route Will Potentially Re-Route Future Trade from the Suez Canal
Access to Arctic shipping routes represents one of the most contentious ongoing debates in the Arctic. Newly accessible shipping routes will pass through multiple national borders, more directly connecting Europe, Russia, and China. The two major Arctic shipping routes that are now navigable during portions of the summer months include the Northern Sea Route (NSR) and the Northwest Passage. The Northern Sea Route connects Asia and Europe, extending from Rotterdam to Shanghai. If the NSR can be successfully developed, it would re-route shipping trade currently moving through the Suez Canal. A strategic priority for China and Russa, it’s completion would save China billions of dollars in shipping costs and provide Russia with revenues through transit fees. In January of 2020, Russian president Vladimir Putin laid out an ambitious decree that aims to triple shipping through the Arctic from 31.5 million tons of cargo in 2019 to 90 million by 2030. However, achieving this goal relies on continued investment from China, which has already set aside $9.5 billion to invest in Russian Arctic development.
Notable Private Sector and SOE Activity:
- Maersk conducted an Arctic voyage along the Northern Sea Route in 2018 and is actively exploring opportunities for future shipping activities. COSCO has completed roughly thirty voyages throughout the Arctic.
- Other major shipping companies CMA CGM, Hapag-Loyd, and MSC have backed away from use of Arctic shipping routes, citing environmental concerns.
Controversy and competition swirl around the NSR due Russia’s territorial claims over the route; it exercises complete control over the NSR, and any ship passing through must obtain clearance from Russian authorities. According to the UNCLOS, the entire NSR lies within Russia’s EEZ. The U.S., which is not a signatory on the UNCLOS, claims that the NSR is in international waters, meaning freedom of navigation applies and Russia does not have legal jurisdiction over trade along the route. Despite the U.S.’s ongoing challenge to Russian control, the U.S. has not been able effectively mount a challenge or bring or nations to its side.
While currently transiting only a fraction of the amount of cargo of the Suez Canal—in 2019, only 31 million tons of good were shipped along the NSR, compared to 1.2 billion tons shipped along the Suez Canal—the potential volume enabled by climate change could transform global trade. Development of the NSR is estimated to attract $200 billion in investment over the next fifteen years, primarily for icebreaking vessels and ports. As the volume of cargo transiting through the NSR increases, it is likely to attract more investment from nations beyond China. Finland is a leading ship manufacturer and is already working with Russia to develop polar icebreakers, and India is exploring the possibility of importing Russian natural gas through the Northern Sea Route. The Northwest Passage, which connects New York to Shanghai by cutting through the Arctic along the Canadian and Alaskan coasts, is not yet as developed as the Northern Sea Route. In 2019, only twenty-seven ships passed through the Northwest Passage, down from thirty-one in 2017. However, if the Northern Sea Route can create significant economic gains as sea ice melts in the coming years, development along the Northwest Passage will also increase. As that development materializes, the Canadian sovereignty of the Northwest Passage—which the U.S. also disputes—will become a more central issue.

Potential Shipping Routes
Submarine Internet Cables Will Digitally Connect Europe and Asia While Providing Monitoring Capabilities to Russia and China
Notable Private Sector and SOE Activity:
- Cinia Oy and Huawei Marine are building submarine Internet cables along the NSR.
- Quintillion is invested in building submarine cables to connect London and Tokyo.
- MegaFon is the Russian telecom company that is working with Internet providers to deliver services from the submarine cable along the NSR.
- Datakortet is a Norwegian data storage company that is working to use the NSR submarine Internet connection to expand data center operations.
In addition to shipping routes, melting sea ice is enabling companies to lay submarine Internet cable beneath the Arctic Ocean. Submarine Internet cables increase connectivity speeds and enable real-time monitoring of Internet traffic and underwater activity using acoustic sensors. In 2018, the Russian Armed Forces began construction on a submarine Internet cable along portions of the Northern Sea Route that facilitates monitoring of the Arctic waters between China and Norway. An additional submarine Internet cable along the NSR began construction in 2016, as a joint venture between the Finnish company Cinia Oy and the Chinese company Huawei Marine. Once completed, the submarine cable between Finland and China will allow Chinese monitoring along the NSR seabed, similar to China’s existing monitoring capabilities in the South China Sea. The ability to monitor the seas using Internet cables is a key point of contention with the U.S., since Russian submarine cables create a distinct military advantage along the NSR, which the U.S. considers international waters.
The ongoing confrontation over global control of the Internet’s hard infrastructure playing out over 5G will no doubt turn to Russia’s and China’s development of undersea Internet cables in the Arctic and globally. While the U.S. is raising alarms over China’s control of global 5G networks, China is intensifying its focus on undersea cables—which make up 95 percent of all data and voice traffic between continents. China’s Huawei, under its Marine Networks division, is constructing or improving nearly 100 submarine cables around the world. Despite potential U.S. pushback, the demand for submarine Internet development along the NSR is high—with Finland eager to develop its growing data center industry, and Japan also invested in the Arctic Connect project, hoping to access increased Internet speeds. The U.S. has already demonstrated a willingness to take extreme measures to block Huawei’s development of 5G networks internationally, blocking companies around the world from using American-made machinery and software to design or produce semiconductors for Huawei, pressuring governments to ban its Huawei hardware, and banning U.S. government agencies and contractors from operating on Chinese telecoms. The same pattern will potentially play out with submarine Internet cables. If more European and Asian countries adopt submarine Internet cables linked to China, that will imperil their future commercial and diplomatic relationships with the U.S. and potentially force them to choose between commercial ties to the U.S. or China.
Planned Submarine Internet Cable Lines
- Arctic Fiber (2014): A $1.5 billion submarine cable linking Tokyo and London via Alaska and Canada. Submarine cables would pass through the Atlantic Ocean, the Canadian coast, the Alaskan coast, and the Bering Strait.
- Arctic Connect (2016): A joint venture between Finnish company Cinia Oy and Huawei Marine to build a submarine communication cable along the Northern Sea Route linking Europe and Asia. The submarine Internet cables would connect Finland, Norway, Russia, China, Japan, and South Korea.
- Russian Military Cable (2018): Russian construction of a submarine cable for military communications, which will stretch 12,700 kilometers on the seafloor across the Arctic Ocean to the border of Norway.
Looking Ahead: Commercial Competition Setting the Stage for Regional Defense Buildup
Melting sea ice is enabling increased access to the Arctic’s abundant natural resources, with tensions growing over the control of Arctic waters and major commercial implications—particularly for shipping routes and future digital connectivity. Additionally, the Arctic’s geographic position among Europe, the U.S., and Russia makes it susceptible to geopolitical confrontations among nations, sparked by events outside of the region. While the Arctic has been a region of international cooperation and peace in recent decades, increased U.S. and Chinese involvement in the region could upset this balance. The U.S. is likely to continue pushing back against China’s increased presence and against Russia’s assertion of control over the NSR and its military buildup. While European nations have been split on accepting Chinese investment, with economic and geopolitical considerations differing across countries, to date they have largely not opposed Russian economic development in the region. However, Russia’s increasing military presence has pushed Europe to begin collaborating with NATO allies to counter military activity in the Arctic. Russia’s military buildup presents one of the greater challenges facing the region, and militarization of the Arctic is likely to increase tensions in the region more quickly than competition over resources. In Part II of FP Analytics’ Arctic Competition Power Map series, we will explore Russia’s increasing militarization of the Arctic, China’s role, and the Arctic’s governance framework’s ability to manage competition among great powers.

In this window of time, some of these open-water areas come to life with phytoplankton blooms so large and vivid they can be seen from space.
The summer of 2020 has been one of those summers. Phytoplankton—the floating plant-like organisms that, like plants on land, need sunlight and nutrients to thrive—have exploded in numbers, or “bloomed,” across ice-free northern latitudes. The image above, acquired on July 26 with the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on NASA’s Terra and Aqua satellites, shows a bloom of phytoplankton in the Barents Sea, north of Scandinavia and Russia.
In the Barents Sea, blooms that show up in spring and early summer are typically composed of diatoms—a microscopic form of algae with silica shells and ample chlorophyll, which makes them appear green in satellite images. By late July and into autumn, waters become warmer and more stratified. This change promotes blooms of coccolithopohres, a type of phytoplankton that turns the water milky white-green in satellite imagery due to their calcium carbonate shells. Sometimes, as is likely the case here, both types of phytoplankton show up to at once.
While blooms around the Arctic are somewhat common, new research has shown that phytoplankton biomass is continuing to increase in the Arctic Ocean. In a recent paper published in Science, researchers from Stanford University found that the rate of growth of phytoplankton biomass across the Arctic Ocean increased by 57 percent between 1998 and 2018.
The success of phytoplankton in this increasingly ice-free environment is apparent in the map above. It shows changes in the amount of chlorophyll a—the pigment used by phytoplankton to harness sunlight for making food—during the past two decades across the Arctic Ocean. The map was produced using a regional algorithm that incorporates satellite data from NASA’s SeaWiFS and MODIS instruments. Notice that most of the increase is in the Chukchi and Barents seas.
“We were certainly surprised to see that phytoplankton biomass has begun to increase in the Arctic,” said Stanford biological oceanographer Kevin Arrigo, whose doctoral student Kate Lewis led the study. “Many people have been saying that with increased melt, nutrient inventories would decline, but that is not what we saw.”
Between 1998 and 2008, the increase in phytoplankton biomass was likely the result of increasingly vast expanses of ice-free waters and a longer growing season. Since 2009, the increases have been due to phytoplankton growing in ever-higher concentrations. The implication is that nutrients might be increasing in some parts of the Arctic Ocean.
Not all areas saw increases; the waters east of Greenland stand out. Arrigo speculated that the decline there could be related to higher nutrient consumption “upstream” in waters that have become more productive. “But we would have to go there and look to know for sure,” he said.
It remains unclear how phytoplankton biomass will change in the future as Arctic sea ice cover continues to shrink. “The Arctic Ocean is changing in an alarming rate and soon may lose a lot of its uniquely polar characteristics,” Arrigo said. “There will always be winter ice, but for the rest of the year, it’s starting to look a lot like our temperate oceans.”

Changes in the Arctic climate will also affect the rest of the world through increased global warming and rising sea levels. More...
1.2 The Arctic region is the area around the North Pole, essentially an ocean surrounded by land. In the far north, the Arctic is mostly covered by snow and ice, whereas the southernmost part is covered by boreal forests. In between, there is a wide expanse of tundra. The Arctic is home to an array of plants, animals, and people that survive in some of the most extreme conditions on the planet and that are uniquely adapted to such conditions. Climate change, pollution, and growing resource use are factors that put an increasing pressure on fragile Arctic populations and ecosystems. More...
1.3 The Arctic region is home to almost four million people, including an increasing majority of non-indigenous settlers. The Arctic includes Greenland, Iceland, and the northern parts of Norway, Sweden, Finland, Canada, Russia, and the United States. Economically, the region depends largely on natural resources, ranging from oil, gas, and metal ores to fish, reindeer and birds. Recently, the tourism sector has also grown in many parts of the Arctic. More...
2.1 Evidence of the recent warming of the Arctic is provided by: records of increasing temperatures; melting glaciers, sea ice, and permafrost; and rising sea levels. More...
2.2 Global temperatures are expected to increase further during the 21st century. In the Arctic, this warming is expected to be substantially greater than the global average, and the following changes are expected over the current century* :
The average annual temperatures are projected to rise by 3 to 7 °C (5 to 13°F), with the greatest warming occurring in the winter months
Precipitation is projected to increase by roughly 20%.
Sea ice is expected to continue to decline significantly, reflecting less solar radiation and thereby increasing regional and global warming.
The area of Arctic land covered by snow is expected to decrease by 10 to 20%.
These projections assume a gradual warming. However, abrupt and unexpected changes cannot be ruled out. More...
3.4 By 2100, melting of Arctic glaciers alone will have contributed to a sea level rise of roughly 5 cm out of the projected 10-90cm total rise for this century.*2 Melting of the Greenland ice sheet may increase this number significantly. More...

Coastal communities face increasing exposure to storms
6.1 Many coastal communities and facilities face increasing exposure to storms.
Rising temperatures are modifying the Arctic coastline and are expected to change it even more in the future. Sea level rise is likely to cause flooding of marshes and coastal plains and accelerate beach erosion. Some towns and industrial facilities are already suffering severe damage as a result of erosion, and are now facing the prospect of relocation. More...

8. What changes are expected in specific areas of the Arctic?
In a region as large as the Arctic, there are significant sub-regional variations in climate. Recent warming has been more dramatic in some regions than in others. Moreover, local features of the natural world and societies create differences in what impacts will occur and which will be most significant locally.
The Arctic Climate Impact Assessment (ACIA) focuses on four sub-regions and considers a series of key impacts:
impacts on the environment, such as changes in habitats and in the geographic spread of plant and animal species,
impacts on the economy, such as changes in access to resources, and
impacts on people’s lives, such as effects on traditional lifestyles or damage to infrastructure.
The Arctic Climate Impact Assessment (ACIA) represents the first effort to comprehensively examine climate change and its impacts in the Arctic region, bringing together the findings of hundreds of scientists and the insights of indigenous people.
There remain important gaps in knowledge that will require improved long-term monitoring, studies of ecosystem processes, climate modeling, as well as analysis of impacts on society. The International Polar Year (in 2007-2009) will be an opportunity to improve our understanding of the impacts of climate change. More...
Climate change presents a major and growing challenge to the Arctic and the world as a whole. Implications are particularly great for future generations that will face the consequences of current action or inaction.
10.1 Resulting environmental changes will present risks as well as opportunities across the Arctic. For example, the large reduction in summer sea ice threatens the future of several ice-dependent species but will also increase marine access to resources and population centers. More...
10.2 The scenarios used in this assessment assume that changes will be gradual. However, because of the complexity of the Earth’s climatic system, major surprises are possible if climate evolves differently. Ocean currents, in the North Atlantic might undergo major changes with wide-ranging consequences for climate. More...
10.3 Impacts of changing climate in the Arctic are already being widely observed and felt. They provide an early indication for the rest of the world of the significance of climate change. The changes will also reach far beyond the Arctic, affecting global climate, sea level, biodiversity, and many aspects of social and economic systems. Climate change in the Arctic thus deserves and requires urgent attention by decision makers and the public worldwide. More...

Not to be confused with it's colder, Southern Hemisphere counterpart known as the Antarctic Circle, the Arctic Circle is located approximately 66.5 degrees north of the equator (the exact coordinates vary slightly depending on Earth's axial tilt), and marks the southern border of the Arctic. Because of this, the Arctic Circle is often used as a reference point to express proximity to the Arctic region.
Geography
The Arctic Circle covers an area about 5.5 million square miles (14.5 million square kilometers), according to the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute. That's slightly less than 3% of Earth's surface area. At the Arctic's center lies the North Pole, which is surrounded by the waters of the Arctic Ocean; the ocean itself is surrounded by land from eight countries: Canada, the United States, Russia, Finland, Sweden, Norway, Iceland and Greenland. Alaska is the only U.S. state with access to the Arctic Circle, and Fairbanks, Alaska, is the closest major city (it's about 198 miles (158 km) away).
The Arctic landscape is nothing short of a winter wonderland made up of glaciers, icebergs, sea ice and permafrost (soil and rock that remains frozen for years at a time). Most of the Arctic is covered by the Arctic Ocean, but because of the extreme conditions found at these latitudes, the ocean's surface is partially frozen over. Called ""sea ice,"" this frozen seawater typically ranges from 6 to 9 feet (2 to 3 meters) in thickness, according to the National Snow & Ice Data Center. Arctic sea ice waxes and wanes with the seasons; it grows from late September through March, then shrinks from April to mid-September, but never entirely disappears.

Arctic climate
Despite containing copious amounts of water, the Arctic is considered to be the world's second-largest polar desert. This is thanks to its largely tundra climate and the fact that most areas receive only 6 to 10 inches (15 to 25 centimeters) of precipitation, on average, each year.
Average air temperatures above the Arctic Circle are around minus 30 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 34 degrees Celsius) in winter. Arctic air often spreads southward in winter to regions well outside of the Arctic Circle. One of the most infamous examples of this is the polar vortex, which is responsible for record cold outbreaks in the United States.

While Arctic winters are biting, Arctic summers can be surprisingly balmy, with temperatures of 50 F (10 C) not uncommon.
In June 2020, the Arctic Circle experienced its highest-ever recorded temperature: 100.4 F (38 C) in the town of Verkhoyansk, Russia, Live Science previously reported. Typically, June highs in Verkhoyansk average around 68 F (20 C).
Who lives within the Arctic Circle?
Despite the Arctic's polar climate, approximately 4 million people call it home. Indigenous peoples, including the Inuit and Yupik, have inhabited its territory for thousands of years. For generations, they survived the region's harsh conditions by living a subsistence life of hunting, herding, fishing and gathering wild plants for food. Eating a diet rich in animal and fish fats also helped insulate their bodies from extreme cold, according to a 2015 study published in the journal Science. While Indigenous communities still pass down traditional knowledge and skills to younger generations, many now live fairly modern lifestyles.
Polar bears are one of the most iconic animals of the Arctic. Unique to the region, these creatures are the world's largest terrestrial carnivores. They spend much of their lives in and around the water, especially on sea ice. Narwhals, a rare type of tusked whale, are also unique to the Arctic.
Other residents of the region include Arctic foxes, reindeer, caribou, seabirds (such as gulls and puffins), seals and walruses, according to the World Wildlife Fund.
Approximately 2,000 plant species exist in the Arctic, according to the Arctic Centre at the University of Lapland in Finland. Most of these are low shrubs, grasses, mosses, lichens and other plant life that don't require deep root systems or prolonged growing seasons.
Spectacular skies
The Arctic is home to a number of atmospheric phenomena that can't be seen anywhere else on Earth. On the summer solstice, locations above the Arctic Circle experience the ""midnight sun"" or ""polar day"" — a 24-hour period of continuous daylight. On the winter solstice, the sun fails to fully rise above the horizon and locations experience 24 hours of twilight, or ""polar night."" The farther north one travels from the Arctic Circle, the longer this period of daylight and nighttime lasts during the summer and winter seasons, respectively. Once the North Pole (90 degrees north) is reached, the midnight sun doesn't set for six months.
Related: The myth of Arctic daylight and darkness exposed
The Arctic is also a prime viewing location for the aurora borealis, or northern lights — the rippling rivers of green and pink light created when gaseous particles in Earth's atmosphere collide with charged solar particles. Because Earth's magnetic field is weakest at the poles, the sun's protons and electrons can more easily penetrate the atmosphere here, which triggers more collisions and more luminous light to be emitted.
Climate change hotspot
The Arctic is warming at rates two to three times faster than the rest of the planet, according to a 2019 report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a United Nations panel for assessing the science related to climate change. One reason for this amplified polar warming is the melting of sea ice. As Arctic air temperatures warm and sea ice and snow cover (which both reflect an abundance of light) thaws, the Arctic is unable to reflect as much of the sun's incoming energy away from Earth's surface and back into space, and thus, loses its ability to maintain cooler temperatures. What's more, this thawing uncovers darker-colored land and ocean surfaces — surfaces that absorb more sunlight than they reflect, and therefore compound atmospheric heating.
Since satellite-based measurements began in the late 1970s, annual average sea-ice extent has declined by 40%. According to a 2020 study published in the journal Climate, scientists project the Arctic Circle may be virtually ice-free during Arctic summers by the year 2034.
The disappearance of sea ice creates economic opportunities, including the opening of new oil fields and shipping routes. However, environmentalists and Indigenous communities typically consider such activities to be a threat to nature. According to leading conservation organizations like The Center for Biological Diversity and World Wildlife Fund, such activities could lead to an environmental disaster such as an oil spill, and an uptick in greenhouse gas emissions.

Unfortunately, one of the last wild places within the Arctic—the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, where birds from all 50 states and six continents come to breed—is imminently threatened by oil and gas development.
Read on to explore the Arctic and learn about seven common species that visit every year to forage and nest in this special place. Then take action by asking Congress to restore long-standing protections to the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
1. Long-tailed Duck
In the winter, large flocks of this duck dive for mollusks and crustaceans in the Great Lakes and along America's coasts, stopping in Oregon on the west coast and the Carolinas in the east. Long-tailed Ducks are some of the first to arrive in the Arctic around April or early-May, where they scrape out nests near tundra pools.
2. Snow Bunting
As the name may suggest, the Snow Bunting breeds in the high Arctic tundra, making nests in cavities between rocks. But in the wintertime, these birds travel as far south as Colorado, foraging in fields and short-grass prairies, and along shorelines.
3. American Tree Sparrow
This little brown bird is a common winter sight at feeders across the northern United States, especially on the ground foraging for any spilled seeds. In the summer, these sparrows fly north to the tundra, nesting close to the ground in low bushes or grass at or above the tree line, where scrubby brush habitat meets thickets of trees.
4. Glaucous Gull
This light-colored, large gull can be spotted on both coasts as far down as California and Virginia in the winter, but it chooses to breed in the high Arctic, nesting among sea grass on shoreline cliffs. When the gulls migrate for the winter, records show that immature gulls will move the furthest south.
5. Rough-legged Hawk
This raptor is a common sight, perching near marsh or pastureland throughout southern Canada and most of the United States, save the southeast. When it's time to breed, though, the Rough-legged Hawk heads to the Arctic tundra, where its cliff-side nests are bathed with hours of sunshine and have ample amounts of lemming nearby for dinner.
6. Common Redpoll
Though flocks of these buzzy finches can be found as far south as Kansas and Missouri in the winter, Common Redpolls spend their summers breeding in open woodland shrubs throughout the Arctic. These seedeaters visit backyard feeders in winter months, but they are most commonly found gleaning tree branches and shaking out catkins and seedpods for a meal.
7. Red-throated Loon
The smallest of the loons, the Red-throated Loon can commonly be found diving for fish along both coasts in winter, and in shallow bays and estuaries all the way south to Mexico and Florida. But during summer, they disappear deep into the Arctic to breed in ponds and lakes on the tundra.",,National Audubon Society,,,2019-09-03,Audubon

The Arctic environment
Antarctica (Section 16.3) is a continent in a hemisphere that is mostly water. The Arctic (Fig 1) is mostly ocean, surrounded by mostly land. Therefore the two polar areas are very different. Greenland is covered by an icecap up to 2,700 m thick. Its northern tip is less than 800 km from the North Pole. West of Greenland is the Canadian Arctic Archipelago (1, 3), extending from Resolution Island at 61� N to Ellesmere Island at 83� N, about 2,400 km away. It is almost entirely within the Arctic Circle (at 67� N). The Arctic Islands are numerous, the region is about two million km2, 65% of which is land. There are rugged mountains exceeding 2000 m towards Greenland, mainly Baffin Island, but the average elevation of the islands in the west is below 300 m. The vegetation in summer is tundra, wherever there is neither bare ground, snowfields or glaciers. There are a few other large islands in the eastern (Eurasian) hemisphere, in particular Svalbard and Novaya Zemlya.

The dark gray tone is the area of discontinuous permafrost and the light gray tone is continuous permafrost. The other lines are less important (source: GRID-Arendal, Norway)
Icebergs and the Titanic
Fig 2. (left) an example of an iceberg of Newfoundland.Some underwater roots of the berg can be seen. (right or below) The grey shaded area is the normal range of icebergs in the North Atlantic in spring. Observations of extreme icebergs or growlers are indicated. Growlers are small chunks of ice (less than 5 m high and less than 15 m long) (Source: the International Ice Patrol)
The RMS Titanic, a great ocean liner believed to be unsinkable, made its maiden voyage from England to New York in 1912. On 14 April, just before midnight, she collided at 22 knots with an iceberg estimated to be 70-150 m long and 20-40 m high above the water surface. The Titanic sank with the loss of 1513 lives in the icy waters. The collision happened at a latitude of merely 42� N. It is notable that huge icebergs last to such a low latitude (the same as that of Rome), after drifting from Baffin Bay within the Arctic Circle (Fig 2). Such drifts are relatively rare. It is estimated that of the 15,000 to 30,000 icebergs produced annually by the glaciers of Greenland only one percent (150 to 300) ever make it to the Atlantic Ocean.
Icebergs of course extend much deeper in the water than they are high. The ratio of the submerged mass to the total mass equals the ratio of the density of ice to that of water, i.e. about 7/8. While almost all icebergs in the Southern Ocean are tabular (flat top), most are not in the Arctic, as in Fig 2.
The Arctic Ocean, and sea ice
Most of the Arctic Ocean is over 1000 m deep and is continuously covered with ice whose thickness varies between 1-10 m. About one third of the Arctic Ocean is shallow, i.e. continental shelf. Over these shelf areas, ice is absent at least part of the year, but ice is found year-round over the deep ocean. Therefore the seasonal variation of the area of sea ice is smaller in the Arctic than around Antarctica. In the Arctic, the sea-ice area ranges between 9 and 12 x 106 km2 (as opposed to 4 and 19 x 106 km2 around Antarctica). As a comparison, the contiguous USA is about 9 x 106 km2 in size. Much of the Arctic seasonal variation in ice cover can be found in the Bering Sea (mainly adjacent to the continents, and south to the Aleutian Islands), and in the Sea of Okhotsk, as far south as 42�N, near Hokkaido, Japan. Yet even in winter the area between Norway and Svalbard is ice-free, notwithstanding its high latitude (about 77�N), on account of the Gulf Stream.
There is some evidence that the Arctic sea-ice cover has decreased about 6% during the last two decades, and that the mean ice thickness has decreased as well. The sea-ice cover must have been thicker during the last Ice Age (esp. between 26 - 13 kaBP), because there is no sediment of atmospheric dirt of that age on the seabed (4). The amount of sea ice is rather sensitive to climate change: meltwater ponding, for instance, dramatically increases the albedo of sea ice, leading to enhanced ice melt.
Unlike tropical oceans, which are temperature-stratified (i.e. there is a thermocline), the Arctic Ocean is salinity-stratified, although at high latitudes the ocean is much less stable. The temperature profile is nearly uniform at 0 to 1� C in the Arctic Ocean, but the salinity increases slightly with depth, especially at 10-100 m below the surface. The presence of this halocline is important in the formation of ice. Because of its salt, ocean water freezes only at -1.8�C. And salt water is most dense at its freezing point, unlike fresh water, which is most dense at 4�C. So if there were no halocline in the Arctic Ocean, the entire ocean column would have to cool to -1.8� C before its surface could freeze (Note 11.5).
The Arctic Basin receives a large amount of fresh water from the large rivers on the surrounding continents (mainly the MacKenzie in Canada and the Ob, the Yenisey and the Lena in Siberia), and during the short summer these freshwater sources spread out over large areas. Because of its low salinity, this water remains close to surface and is first to freeze up in autumn. First year ice can be readily distinguished from older ice in that it is smoother and less thick. Even in winter there are usually long leads of open water, mainly downwind of continental areas. These leads, or polynias, are an important source of heat and moisture to the Arctic. Therefore even in winter stratus clouds are common.
The Arctic Basin is virtually closed near Alaska, because the Bering Strait is narrow and shallow (~50m deep). There is some inflow of low-salinity water from the Bering Sea into the Arctic. More significant circulation occurs on the Atlantic side, with inflow north of Norway and outflow near Greenland. As a result of these currents, the sea ice drifts, generally cyclonically around the Pole. Because of the southward transport off East Greenland, ice is found there year-round, as far south as Greenland's southern tip (60�N). In the winter and early spring icebergs are found as far south as 45�N near Newfoundland, due to the Labrador current. This puts some icebergs in the main transatlantic shipping lane, a fact which proved fatal to the Titanic.
The Labrador Current is anomalously fresh, especially in summer, because of the melting of ice. It proceeds from the southern tip of Greenland southwards along the coast of Newfoundland, where it deflects east the poleward warm and salty North Atlantic current, at about 52�N. The mixture of cold water from the Labrador current with saltier water may make the top layer unstable. Therefore deep-water formation often occurs near the edge of the Labrador current (5).
Arctic climate
Because of the high latitude, there is a strong seasonal cycle and a weak diurnal cycle. Annual mean incoming solar radiation north of the Arctic circle is 100 W/m2, most of it between the spring and autumn equinoxes. Midlatitude places receive about 150-200 W/m2 on average.
As a result, daily mean temperatures are below freezing for several months: 3 months in Toronto (44� N), 8 months at Iqaluit (64� N), and 10 months at Alert (83� N) at the north end of Ellesmere Island. The lowest January mean near-sea-level temperature measured in the northern hemisphere (ie - 35� C) was measured at Alert. Record low temperatures have occurred in inland valleys, e.g. - 55.8� C at Lake Hazen. The daily temprature range is small because of the level Sun, i.e. less than 3 K, except in April and May when they may approach 6 K.
Precipitation from the cold air is modest, mostly under 250 mm/a. For instance Resolute (75� N) receives about 137 mm/a on average, mostly snow. All precipitation data in cold climates are only approximate, because snow is driven by wind and it is hard to discriminate between falling and blowing snow. The more mountainous regions, such as Baffin Island, Greenland (esp the southern coast) and northern Scandinavia receive more precipitation, for instance 663 mm/a falls at 390 m at Cape Dyer (Baffin Island, 64� N).
Precipitation amounts increase with elevation. For instance, on Resolution Island just south of Baffin Island, 313 mm/a falls at 40 m elevation and 404 mm/a at 370 m. This is a 9 % increase per 100 m. Four stations on the White Glacier on Axel Heiberg Island at 79�N yield an increase of about 7%/100 m. These figures are comparable to the about 11 %/100 m for other latitudes (6).
Cloudiness is rather high over the Arctic, and shallow stratus clouds prevail. There is a small but significant contribution to the cloudiness in Arctic regions due to an organic dimethyl sulphide compound called DMSP, formed in the ocean. The cells of phytoplankton (i.e. microscopic algae) burst when they die, releasing DMSP into the water. This degrades into molecules of insoluble sulphide, which are released into the air on the evaporation of spray, for instance. These aerosol molecules help nucleate cloud droplets (4).
It is not as windy in the Arctic as near the Antarctic coast, in part because the pressure gradients are weaker, and because katabatic winds do not exist over most of the Arctic. Yet the katabatic winds which blow off West Greenland are sufficient to drive ice floes away from the shore, and to induce a northwards ocean current along the coast.

Or are they? Researchers recently mined a global lightning database and found that the fraction of lightning occurring over the Arctic has grown by more than 300% over the past 11 years. That’s a surprise, the team suggests, and a phenomenon potentially linked to warming temperatures. But other scientists don’t see the same trend in their data.
A team of researchers led by Robert Holzworth, an atmospheric and space physicist at the University of Washington, analyzed data from the World Wide Lightning Location Network (WWLLN). WWLLN detects roughly 700,000 lightning strokes every day on the basis of the radio waves they emit. “Lightning is like a very long antenna in the sky,” said Holzworth, the director of WWLLN. “It’s very efficient at radiating at low frequencies.”
Too Cold, Too Stable
Lightning hotbeds include places like Africa and Southeast Asia. Only a small fraction of the world’s lightning—less than 1%—occurs at high latitudes. That’s because the conditions there are usually too cold and too stable to promote the thermal updrafts necessary for thunderstorm formation, said Holzworth.
But in August 2019 a flurry of lightning strokes occurred within several hundred kilometers of the North Pole. That storm, and others, prompted Holzworth and his collaborators to analyze lightning in the Arctic, which the team defined as the region above latitude 65°N. (The team didn’t study the corresponding area around the South Pole because lightning above the Antarctic is exceedingly rare.)
Eleven Years of Summer
The researchers mined archival WWLLN data from 2010 to 2020. To account for the network’s roughly tenfold increase in detection efficiency since its inception in 2004, they focused on a dimensionless parameter: the number of strokes observed in the Arctic divided by the total number of strokes observed globally. Holzworth and his colleagues furthermore limited their analysis to strokes recorded in June, July, and August since lightning activity is highest in summer months.
Holzworth and his collaborators found that the fraction of lightning occurring in the Arctic increased from roughly 0.2% in 2010 to a little over 0.6% in 2020. That threefold increase is significant, the researchers suggest, and might be tied to warming temperatures in the Arctic.
Global temperatures have been climbing in the past few decades, and the Arctic is warming even faster than other parts of the planet. When Holzworth and his colleagues graphed their dimensionless parameter versus the global temperature anomaly, they found a linear correlation.
The Link Between Warming and Lightning
There’s a causal link between these two quantities, the researchers propose, but admit they don’t have proof. “We know from low-latitude lightning that it is more likely to see lightning in the warm summer months than in the winter,” said Holzworth. “So in the case of the Arctic, it seems a reasonable suggestion that there may be a similar causal link.” Future studies focused on modeling the formation of lightning in different temperature and humidity conditions will be important for demonstrating this link, the scientists suggest.
These results, originally presented at AGU’s Fall Meeting in December, were recently published in Geophysical Research Letters.
An uptick in lightning in the Arctic is potentially bad news, said Yoav Yair, an atmospheric physicist at the Interdisciplinary Center, a private research university near Tel Aviv, Israel, not involved in the research. That’s because lightning can start forest fires, which can, in turn, cause carbon dioxide–containing permafrost to melt. Lightning also produces nitrogen oxides and ozone, said Yair. “You have an additional source of those greenhouse gases.”
Stay Tuned
Not everyone sees this trend in their data, however. Researchers at Vaisala recently analyzed archival data from the Global Lightning Detection Network (GLD360), which they own and operate. Between 2012 and 2020, they didn’t find a substantial increase in the fraction of lightning occurring over the Arctic. However, they acknowledge that their data set spans a shorter time period than the WWLLN data that Holzworth and his colleagues analyzed.
“From the GLD360 data it is apparent that 9 years of lightning data alone is insufficient to draw long-term climatological conclusions,” said Ryan Said, an atmospheric physicist at Vaisala not involved in the research.
But stay tuned, said Said. “We’re excited to see how these trends develop over the years. We’re really in a golden age of lightning detection.”

Alaska’s northern frontier and Arctic Ocean waters are teeming with species found in few other places, and many of them are now under threat from the oil industry and its enablers.
The Western Arctic Reserve and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge provide critical denning areas for polar bears; support vast caribou herds; and are essential nesting grounds for thousands of bird species, including threatened eiders and yellow-billed loons. The sea ice of the Arctic Ocean is hunting and denning habitat for polar bears and a foraging platform for Pacific walrus and numerous Arctic ice seal species. Under the sea ice, endangered bowhead whales and other whale species live off the biological richness of the Arctic Ocean.
Nearly all Arctic species are at risk from climate change. But that’s not the only problem: In a drastically changing environment that’s heating up at more than twice the average global warming rate, Arctic species must now contend with dirty, industrial fossil fuel development.
Save the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge
Help us stop plans to open more than 1.5 million acres of Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas drilling.
OUR CAMPAIGNS
Offshore Oil Development
Over the past decade, the Center and allies have been very successful in blocking offshore-oil development in the Beaufort and Chukchi seas through lawsuits, political organizing and media work. We successfully challenged Shell Oil’s plans to drill several exploratory wells in the Chukchi and Beaufort seas, leading to the company’s decision to abandon the effort. Obama then cancelled planned leases sales in the region and subsequently permanently protected much of the Arctic from offshore drilling.
When the Trump administration first tried to drastically expand offshore leasing in the Arctic and other U.S. oceans, including by trying to undo Obama’s Arctic protections, we sued and we won. That victory upheld presidents’ authority to permanently remove oceans from the leasing plan and caused the administration to suspend its offshore-drilling expansion plans.
We also successfully challenged Trump’s approval of the controversial Liberty project in the Beaufort Sea and have sued over the expansion of drilling in Cook Inlet, home to a critically endangered population of beluga whales. Both those projects are being pushed by Hilcorp Alaska, whose terrible record on safety and regulatory compliance we’re working to publicize.
The Center and our allies continue to battle it out in court, while at the same time pressing for a permanent halt on offshore drilling in all U.S. waters, starting in Alaska. We’ll do everything we can to make sure the Trump administration doesn’t get to finalize its latest proposal to weaken offshore-drilling safety rules specially designed for Arctic.
Oil Development on Land
In 2020 we filed two landmark lawsuits, under 24 hours apart, challenging the Trump administration's attempts to open vast areas of the precious Arctic to oil and gas. First we filed suit with allies to block a plan to open more than a million acres of the pristine Arctic National Wildlife Refuge — one of the world's most important wild places and habitat for polar bears, caribou and Arctic foxes — to oil and gas leasing. The next day we and our partners were in court again to challenge the administration's plan to lease more than 18 million acres of the Western Arctic Reserve — also called the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska — a wild Arctic landscape that deserves protection, not exploitation.
We’ve been working to save the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge since 2001, when we forced the Bush administration to release information about the impacts of Arctic Refuge oil drilling on polar bears. The oil industry continues to push for destructive drilling and sadly has convinced the Trump administration and congressional Republicans to open the area up to oil leasing, but we’re fighting to ensure it stays off limits to oil activity.
While the Arctic Refuge hasn't seen any drilling yet, the Western Arctic Reserve hasn't been so lucky. It is the largest roadless area in the United States, made up of more than 23 million mostly untouched acres — including Teshekpuk Lake, one of the country’s most important wetlands — and is home to numerous imperiled species, including spectacled and Steller's eiders, yellow-billed loons and polar bears. The Obama administration issued a plan protecting roughly half of the reserve from oil leasing, including Teshekpuk Lake.
But the Trump administration issued a new plan proposing to open up 18.7 million acres of the Arctic Reserve to oil and gas development in June 2020, including in long-protected sensitive habitat areas. Burning the recoverable oil in the region would release more than 1 billion tons of carbon pollution, the equivalent of running 300 coal-fired power plant for a year. Beyond our suit to challenge that plan, we'll continue to oppose any of the individual drilling projects it allows.
And we’ll defend the Arctic from the Trump administration’s latest proposal to weaken offshore drilling safety rules specially designed for the region’s hazardous, remote waters.",,,,,,Centerforbiodiv

Alaska and the Arctic
- Retreating and thinning arctic summer sea ice, increasing temperatures, and ocean acidification are increasingly affecting marine fish and wildlife habitats, species distributions, and food webs, all of which are important to people in the Arctic.
- Arctic residents, communities, and their infrastructure continue to be affected by permafrost thaw, coastal and river erosion, increasing wildfire, and glacier melt. As temperatures continue increasing, individuals and even whole communities will need to decide how and where to live.
- The temperature of permafrost soils in the Arctic is rising, leading to drier landscapes, more wildfire, altered wildlife habitat, and increased costs to maintain infrastructure. Warming and thawing of permafrost soils increases their release of carbon dioxide and methane, leading to further climate warming.
- Strong warming linked to reductions in the area of snow and ice can influence atmospheric circulation and precipitation patterns, both within the Arctic and around the world.
- A warming climate brings threats to human health, especially for rural residents who face increased risk of storm damage and flooding, loss of vital food sources, disrupted traditional practices, or relocation. Implementing proactive adaptation strategies would reduce the physical, social, and psychological harm likely to occur under a warming climate.
- The cumulative effects of climate change in the Arctic strongly affect Native communities and the ecosystems on which they depend. Though these communities have a deep cultural history of adapting to change, they are highly vulnerable to these rapid changes and intensifying impacts.
Key Points:
Scientific evidence demonstrates with increasing clarity and certainty that Earth’s climate is changing: it is becoming warmer and more variable, with more intense floods, storms, and droughts. It is also increasingly clear that higher levels of heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere—the result of fossil-fuel emissions, land clearing, and agriculture—have contributed substantially to climate warming. However, the impacts of these changes in Earth’s climate system vary substantially from place to place. The Arctic, for example, is warming twice as fast as the planet as a whole. It is therefore important to understand these Arctic changes, not only because they are likely to be most readily observed in this temperature-sensitive region, but also because they provide insight into the general nature of resilience and vulnerability that may occur on the rest of the planet if climate continues to warm.
The Arctic is projected to continue warming much faster than the rest of the planet if greenhouse gases continue to accumulate in the atmosphere. Managing the responses of ecosystems and society to recent and projected warming requires that we understand not only the changes in climate, but also the changes in ecosystems and their cumulative effects on society. In particular, it is important to know how these processes interact and when these interactions lead to either non-linear (either magnifying or stabilizing) responses or threshold changes in the behavior of the system. Loss of sea ice, glaciers, or permafrost (permanently frozen ground), for example, might dramatically alter the Arctic for both ecosystems and society.
Arctic change is important to global society not only because of its impacts within the Arctic, but also because of the role of the Arctic in the climate of the entire Earth. The climate and the ocean circulation in all parts of the globe are affected by the temperature and pressure gradients between the poles and the equator. These temperature and pressure gradients are becoming weaker because the Arctic is warming faster than lower latitudes. The resulting changes in climate and weather will affect people everywhere.
Kivalina, Alaska. Humans have been a part of the Alaskan Arctic coastline for thousands of years. In recent times, their villages have consolidated and include permanent infrastructure such as roads, runways, and power-generating stations. Many of these communities are just a few meters above sea level and are vulnerable to storm surges and rising sea levels.
Understanding change is the first step toward understanding and building Arctic resilience and reducing its vulnerability to climate change. Systems are resilient when system responses counteract changes that would otherwise have occurred—in other words, when there are stabilizing feedbacks. For example, if society were to adapt to climate warming by reducing fossil fuel emissions, this would reduce the rate of climate warming. Similarly, if Arctic peoples adapt to declining opportunities to hunt ice-dependent marine mammals by diversifying their food sources, this could stabilize their food supply. In ecological systems, a shift from coniferous to deciduous forests would replace flammable coniferous trees with less flammable deciduous ones, which counteracts the effect of rising temperature and drying soils on fire frequency and extent.

(d) Mother and pup harbor seals hauled-out on icebergs calved from McBride Glacier, Glacier Bay National Park, Alaska.
Unfortunately, most of the feedbacks and interactions involved in Arctic change are reducing the resilience of the Arctic. For example, the decline in cover of sea ice, glaciers, and snow cover replaces a white reflective surface with a darker, more absorptive surface of land or water. This increases the absorption of heat by the surface and thus increases the rate of Arctic warming. Similarly, increased fire extent, permafrost loss, decomposition, and methane emission in response to Arctic warming increases emissions of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, and increases climate warming at the global scale—a decrease in climate resilience at the global scale. Adapting to Arctic changes in ways that increase Arctic resilience—for example, by reducing the soot deposition that darkens Arctic snow surfaces—will be a major challenge in the coming decades.

This thawing, which could release vast amounts of greenhouse gases, is already changing the Arctic landscape by causing landslides, draining lakes, and altering vegetation.","Canadian scientist Philip Marsh and I were flying along the coast of the Beaufort Sea, where the frozen tundra had recently opened up into a crater the size of a football stadium. Located along the shoreline of an unnamed lake, the so-called thaw slump was gray, muddy, and barren, in sharp contrast to the brilliant russet and gold of the surrounding autumn tundra. These retrogressive thaw slumps, or landslides — formed as warming temperatures rapidly thaw permafrost — are increasing across the Arctic, including the kilometer-long, 100-meter-deep Batagaika Crater in the Yana River Basin of Siberia.
The tundra of the western Canadian Arctic has long been carpeted in cranberries, blueberries, cloudberries, shrubs, sedges, and lichen that have provided abundant food for grizzly bears, caribou, and other animals. Now, however, as permafrost thaws and slumping expands, parts of that landscape are being transformed into nothing but mud, silt, and peat, blowing off massive amounts of climate-warming carbon that have been stored in the permafrost for millennia. If this had happened in an urban area, it would have resulted in dozens of buildings being swallowed up. If it had happened along a pipeline right-of-way, it might have resulted in an environmental disaster.
As the Arctic warms faster than any region on Earth, public attention has largely been focused on the rapid disappearance of Arctic sea ice. But major changes are also taking place on land, and one of the most striking is the thawing of vast swaths of permafrost that have underlain these polar regions for millennia. That thaw is taking a toll in complex ways that are not clearly understood, and scientists such as Marsh are now intensifying efforts to grasp how these changes will play out this century and beyond.
Some 2.5 million square miles of permafrost — 40 percent of the world’s total — could disappear by the end of the century.
What we do know is that if the Arctic continues to warm as quickly as climatologists are predicting, an estimated 2.5 million square miles of permafrost — 40 percent of the world’s total — could disappear by the end of the century, with enormous consequences. The most alarming is expected to be the release of huge stores of greenhouse gases, including methane, carbon dioxide, and nitrous oxide that have remained locked in the permafrost for ages. Pathogens will also be released.
But less well appreciated are the sweeping landscape changes that will alter tundra ecosystems, making it increasingly difficult for subsistence indigenous people, such as the Inuit, and Arctic animals to find food. The disintegration of subterranean ice that glues together the peat, clay, rocks, sand, and other inorganic minerals is now triggering landslides and slumping at alarming rates, resulting in stream flows changing, lakes suddenly draining, seashores collapsing, and water chemistry being altered in ways that could be deleterious to both humans and wildlife.
“We’re seeing slumping along shorelines that can drain most of the water in a lake in just days and even hours,” says Marsh, a former Canadian government scientist who is now a professor of hydrology at Wilfrid Laurier University in Ontario. “It’s not surprising when you consider that as much as 80 percent of the ground here consists of frozen water. When that ice melts, the frozen ground literally falls apart.” As a result, says Marsh, indigenous communities, the resource industry, and the government need to better understand how a warming climate is impacting water resources and permafrost ecosystems.”
As the helicopter pilot circled Marsh’s research site searching for a dry spot to land, I could see the Husky Lakes in the distance. This is a unique treeline/tundra transitional zone where grizzly bears have been known to kill or mate with polar bears and where sea-going belugas swim into brackish inland lakes.
From the helicopter, the research camp below looked like a stick man. Narrow wooden boardwalks connect weather stations, snow, and rain gauges, and instruments that determine how much carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, and methane are being absorbed by tundra plants and how much of these gases is being emitted into the atmosphere. The boardwalks were laid down so that the scientists’ boots won’t disturb the thawing peat and permafrost or skew the recordings. Solar panels and a back-up generator kept everything powered, including an electrified fence designed to keep out both grizzly and polar bears.
Marsh, who has conducted field work in the Arctic for more than four decades, established this research station in Trail Valley Creek in 1991. Not only is it situated in the most rapidly warming region on Earth, but it is also the site of a new Arctic highway, hundreds of now-dormant exploratory oil and gas drilling sites, and some of the most important bird nesting territory in the Arctic. Like all permafrost scientists, he and his colleagues have worked in arduous conditions, fighting off hordes of biting flies and mosquitoes in the summer, and measuring snowpack and ground temperatures in bitter winter cold.
Marsh’s research in the Canadian Arctic has already led him to conclude that climate warming will result in hydrological changes this century that will dry up 15,000 of the 45,000 lakes in the Mackenzie River Delta, one of the largest deltas in the world. He also expects to see more of what Antoni Lewkowicz, a geographer and permafrost expert at the University of Ottawa, is seeing father north on Banks Island in the High Arctic of Canada. Lewkowicz recently reported a 60-fold increase in slumping along 288 lakes that he has monitored with satellite imagery from 1984 to 2015.
An estimated 1,400 gigatons of carbon are frozen in Arctic permafrost, making it one of the world’s largest carbon sinks.
Slumping can occur with sudden catastrophic force. In one notable case that was captured on time-lapse photography in 2015 by Steve Kokelj, a permafrost expert with the Northwest Territories Geological Survey, a rapidly thawing cliff bordering the shores of a tundra lake collapsed into the Peel River watershed in the Northwest Territories. The waterfall that was created drained approximately 800,000 gallons of water from that upland lake in just two hours. Heavy metals in the permafrost, such as mercury, were flushed downstream along with silt and peat, tainting the river system for miles downstream.
Permafrost occurs in areas where the temperature of the ground remains below the freezing mark for two years or more. About a quarter of the Northern Hemisphere’s landscape fits this definition. Most of the world’s permafrost is found in northern Russia, Canada, Alaska, Iceland, and Scandinavia. Much of it underlies peat ecosystems. But like peat, permafrost is also found in the Rocky Mountains of Canada and Alaska, the Alps, the Himalayas, the high-altitude Patagonia region of South America, and the high country of New Zealand.
The rapid thawing of permafrost has enormous implications for climate change. There are an estimated 1,400 gigatons of carbon frozen in permafrost, making the Arctic one of the largest carbon sinks in the world. That’s about four times more than humans have emitted since the Industrial Revolution, and nearly twice as much as is currently contained in the atmosphere. According to a recent report, a 3.6-degrees Fahrenheit ( 2 degrees Celsius) increase in temperature — expected by the end of the century — will result in a loss of about 40 percent of the world’s permafrost by 2100.
Greenhouse gases on the tundra are released in two ways. As permafrost thaws, once-dormant microorganisms break down organic matter, allowing methane and carbon to be released in the atmosphere. Thawing can also open pathways for methane to rise up from reservoirs deep in the earth.
The permafrost thawing that is leading to the release of greenhouse gases is intensifying across the Arctic. Much of the permafrost degradation that has occurred on Canada’s Banks Island took place after some of the warmest years on record, according to Lewkowicz. In 1984, the island had 60 active slumps. By 2013, there were 4,000. Lewkowicz expects that the island may see as many as 30,000 new active slumps in the coming years.
This thawing will have a profound impact on the flow and chemistry of lakes and streams, as well as those parts of the Arctic Ocean into which rivers drain. Lewkowicz’s satellite data, for example, shows that the color of many of the lakes on Banks Island has changed from blue to turquoise, indicating that the once-clear water has become filled with sediments.
Scientists suspect that some of the slumping may be giving new life to pathogens capable of killing muskoxen, caribou, and nesting birds as warmer temperatures nudge the pathogens out of their dormant state. Massive die-offs of muskoxen on Banks and Victoria islands in Canada, as well as reindeer in Siberia, appear to be related to once-dormant pathogens that are coming back to life.
The date when snow melts is key to determining the rate at which the permafrost thaws.
Scientists are also finding that hundreds of sumps excavated by the oil and gas industry in the 1970s and 1980s are now thawing. Toxic petroleum waste that was supposed to be permanently contained in 200 frozen pits in the Mackenzie Delta, for example, is migrating into nearby freshwater ecosystems.
At Trail Valley Creek, Carolina Voigt, a post-doctoral geography researcher, and Oliver Sonnentag, a hydrologist at the University of Montreal, are using manual and automated sensors to measure how climate change affects greenhouse gas activity on the tundra. Evan Wilcox, a geography PhD candidate at Wilfrid Laurier University, has made important discoveries about the role that the rapid expansion of shrubs in the Arctic — the result of rising temperatures — is playing in the thawing of permafrost. All across the warming Arctic, shrubs are expanding into tundra where grasses, sedges, and lichens once prevailed. Not only are the taller shrubs shading out the smaller plants below, they are also changing the hydrology of the ecosystem.
“We’re finding that the date when snow melts is the key to determining the rate at which the active-layer permafrost thaws,” says Wilcox. “The snow in tundra areas where you have shrubs such as dwarf birch tends to melt a week earlier than it does in areas where there are no shrubs. This results in more permafrost thawing. As the shrubs expand into the tundra, we’re likely to see an acceleration of thawing.”
Wilcox bores steel probes — as many as 3,000 one recent summer — into the ground to determine the depths of ground thaw. Arduous as that is, Niels Weiss, a postdoctoral fellow working with Marsh, has a much tougher time hammering into the solid ice to get the sample he needs to determine how much and what kind of organic material is contained in the permafrost. Weiss has conducted permafrost research in Siberia, Scandinavia, and Canada, and he and others have found that carbon storage and the ways gas is released from these ecosystems depend on a variety of factors such as soil composition, groundwater flow, and whether trees, shrubs, or grasses are predominant. What’s clear, he says, is that even in the coldest places in the Arctic, permafrost is thawing at accelerating rates.
Although much remains to be discovered about the impacts of thawing permafrost in the region, Marsh says one thing is becoming increasingly clear: In the coming decades, the tundra landscape will look much different than it does now.
That change was evident as we bushwhacked through 8-foot-high willows en route to retrieve a water gauge swept away during the spring flood. Thirty years ago, lichen and sedges dominated this landscape. Today, willows and shrubs are proliferating across the tundra. Abundant caribou once fed on the lichen, their numbers on the Tuktoyaktuk Peninsula hitting 3,000 in 2006. Now, only half that number remain.

The Merkel Model and Its Limits
On August 15, The Wall Street Journal reported that U.S. President Donald Trump had expressed interest in purchasing Greenland from Denmark. The subject dominated international headlines for several days. Copenhagen and Nuuk (the capital of Greenland) issued a lighthearted but clear “not for sale” message. Then the world moved on to more pressing issues, and Greenland quickly disappeared from the front pages.
For a brief moment, however, Trump’s foray into the realm of geopolitical real estate touched off a long-overdue discussion about Greenland and the Arctic more generally. The Arctic is vast, encompassing nearly all of Greenland, about one-third of Russia, and parts of several Scandinavian countries, Canada, and the U.S. state of Alaska. This makes the United States part of a small group of countries with direct economic, security, and environmental interests in the region. But since the end of the Cold War the Arctic has mostly figured as an afterthought in U.S. foreign policy. Today, that lack of attention borders on negligence. Climate change is rapidly opening up the once inaccessible region to increased human activity and economic exploitation. As the United States has stood by, rivals such as Russia and China have seized that opportunity both economically and militarily, and their intentions are not wholly benign. If Washington wants to ensure its continued access to the Arctic and safeguard its security in the region in the decades ahead, its best bet is to expand its own presence there while it still can.
Washington’s best bet is to expand its presence in the Arctic while it still can.
Climate change is affecting the Arctic at an astonishing speed. The region is currently warming at twice the average global rate. Retreating sea ice is opening new shipping routes and access to natural resources that were once beyond reach, including rare earths, fishing stocks, and—according to a 2008 U.S. Geological Survey—vast amounts of undiscovered oil and gas. For now, most of these assets lie squarely in the territorial waters and exclusive economize zones of the five Arctic coastal nations. But if current predictions are to be believed, by 2050 even the high seas around the North Pole will be ice-free several months out of the year, potentially creating disputes over access to the area that could easily create diplomatic tussles and perhaps even lead to conflict.
These changes have been some time coming. A decade ago, a White House directive noted that increased activity in the Arctic called for a stronger U.S. presence there. Successive commanders of the U.S. Coast Guard have said as much, warning that the United States lacked the necessary icebreakers, satellite coverage, and port infrastructure to protect American sovereignty in the region. But the Obama administration was preoccupied with the environmental ramifications of climate change rather than its implications for security, and the Pentagon was unenthusiastic about extending its already stretched resources to another corner of the world. Consequently, the Coast Guard’s clarion call fell on deaf ears. For the remainder of the Obama era, the United States operated under the assumption that the Arctic did not warrant a great deal of U.S. investment or attention.
Russia and China, on the other hand, recognized the region as a high priority, from the point of view of both resource extraction and security. By the mid-2000s, both countries had begun investing in the region and taking steps to protect their interests there. China, for example, established its first scientific research station on Norway’s Arctic island of Svalbard in 2004. A decade later, Beijing was investing in Greenland, with a particular focus on the mining of rare earth minerals, which are used in everything from lithium ion batteries to computer hard drives and electric-car motors. In 2016, the China-based mining company Shenghe Resources began extracting at Kvanefjeld, a mineral deposit on Greenland’s southwestern coast believed to hold the world’s second-largest deposit of rare-earth oxides and sixth-largest deposit of uranium. The Danish government made quiet inquiries as to whether the United States had any concerns about this investment, but Washington was silent.
Today China has extended its Belt and Road Initiative to the Arctic, with a project it calls the Polar Silk Road, and which includes investments in ports, railroads, undersea cables, and energy exploration in several Arctic nations. Between 2012 and 2017, China funneled some $154 million into the Icelandic economy. The Trump administration has eyed these activities with growing suspicion, worried that Beijing will use them to entangle the Arctic nations in a web of diplomatic and economic commitments. In June, U.S. officials successfully blocked a major Chinese investment in the expansion of three airports on Greenland, lobbying the Danish government to outbid the Chinese consortium.
The Arctic is currently warming at twice the average global rate.
In the near-term, however, Washington’s near-exclusive focus on China is misplaced; it must focus on Russia’s activities in the region. Russia has much to gain: it already derives 20 percent of its GDP from energy exploitation and shipping in its Arctic territories, and Russian President Vladimir Putin hopes that, as sea ice disappears, the Northern Sea Route—the Arctic shipping lane that runs from just east of Norway all the way to the Bering Strait—will come to match the Suez Canal in maritime traffic. For Asian exporters such as China, the route offers a much faster and thus cheaper passage to Western markets and allows them to avoid piracy around the Horn of Africa and congestion in the Strait of Malacca.
Russia’s ambitions would not be cause for concern if it weren’t for its view that the Northern Sea Route is within its internal waters. The United States, along with most other countries, views the passage as international waters. Russia, however, claims sovereignty over the route and requires traversing vessels to seek its approval and pay transit fees for the use of its icebreakers, navigational aids, and search-and-rescue centers. In December 2017, Moscow decided that only its own vessels could transport certain mineral and energy resources along the route. Since March 2019, military vessels traveling along the passage have had to give Moscow 45 days of advance notice—a requirement that limits freedom of navigation in the Arctic’s international waters.
Russia has amplified such worries by building up defenses along its European Arctic coastline. It has added advanced radar and coastal defense systems, opened or reopened 23 airfields, and begun conducting frequent military exercises in the region, sometimes without advance warning. Much of this activity is likely defensive in outlook. Russia naturally seeks to safeguard its waters and coastline, including its resources, as well as to monitor shipping along the Northern Sea Route. But some recent initiatives look potentially more nefarious. Russia has modernized its fleet of nuclear-armed submarines and dramatically increased their activity in the North Atlantic to levels not seen since the Cold War. The fleet’s base near Russia’s border with Finland is protected by newly added layers of air and coastal defense systems designed to thwart NATO or U.S. attacks. The Kremlin has recently experimented with a range of new weapons systems, including hypersonic cruise missiles, long-range nuclear torpedoes, and nuclear-powered cruise missiles. In the event of a conflict—in the Arctic or another region—these advancements might endanger the United States and allow Russia to block U.S. access to large parts of the North Atlantic.
While the United States has been otherwise engaged, Russia and China have begun to cooperate over Arctic security and Arctic resources. In 2014, Russia came under Western sanctions that cut off the funds and technology it needed to oil and gas from onshore and offshore reserves along its Arctic coast. China stepped into the breach, providing the money in exchange for a stake in a large liquid natural gas project and construction contracts. Putin has suggested merging China’s Maritime Silk Road with the Northern Sea Route. Moscow and Beijing have announced a joint scientific research center in the Russian Arctic, which will explore mineral and energy resources and develop technology to monitor oceanic conditions. In a region that remains hard to navigate, such scientific knowledge is power. And the two countries have stepped up their military cooperation, with Chinese forces joining Russia’s military in Russia’s Eastern Arctic for its largest exercise since the Cold War last year.
Washington has called out such behavior as needlessly aggressive. On a visit to Finland in May, for instance, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo accused Russia and China of provoking a military and economic arms race in the Arctic. But other than by issuing pointed statements, Washington seems at a loss as to how to protect its interests in the region. The United States has commissioned a single, heavy-duty icebreaker, whose operations will mostly be limited to Antarctica, and in 2018 reactivated its regional fleet in the North Atlantic, which it had dissolved in 2011. For the first time in 60 years, it is setting up a permanent diplomatic mission in Nuuk.
But with Russia and China stepping up their presence in the Arctic, the United States needs to do a great deal more. Further investments in the Coast Guard and the Navy, including in surface vessels capable of braving thick ice, would be an important first step. The United States should also fund a much bigger diplomatic and scientific presence in the Arctic and strive to become a leader in the sustainable management of maritime resources. Above all, it must understand that if it remains absent from the region, it may one day be the United States’ own Arctic real estate that is up for sale.
CORRECTION APPENDED (September 26, 2019): An earlier version of this article misstated the amount of Chinese investment in Iceland from 2012 to 2017. It was $154 million, not $1.2 billion. We regret the error.

_______________________
Last summer, I had the incredible opportunity to visit Arctic Alaska. It is a region that’s as vast as it is beautiful. It is also an area that’s critical for the health of our planet. Often referred to as “the world’s refrigerator,” the Arctic plays an essential role in regulating global temperatures and counteracting climate change.
But, the Arctic is in trouble.
Experiencing accelerated effects of climate crisis, it is warming at twice the rate as the rest of the globe.
And a melting Arctic should alarm everyone. These dramatic shifts are further destabilizing temperatures around the world, and threatening one of the most vital and pristine ecosystems on the planet.
Incredibly, for some, the diminishing sea ice opens new opportunity. For the first time ever, there exists the possibility of cargo traffic through Arctic sea routes that were previously unnavigable. The draw is decreased transit times compared to traditional routes. While not yet a regular service offered by ocean container carriers, transit through the Northeast Passage is a very real possibility. Test voyages completed by some ocean carriers and studies estimate the Northern Sea Route could be used for approximately 8% of total container trade between Asia and Europe by 2030, increasing to ~10% of such trade by 2050. We do not have to accept that outcome.
The science is clear. Even with regulation, substantial and irreversible risk to the environment exists in the form of oil spills, emissions, vessel strikes and invasive species, which not only impact marine life, but also the human populations that rely on a healthy Arctic ecosystem for their livelihood. Beyond that, it’s estimated that carbon emissions from shipping via the Northeastern Passage would be significantly higher due to the need for smaller, less efficient vessels and increased fuel requirements.
It shouldn’t be an option for anyone.
At Nike, we exist to serve athletes. That means protecting the future of sport by helping to protect the planet and taking climate action through Move to Zero, Nike’s journey towards a zero carbon, zero waste future. We know climate change impacts how and where our athletes train and play, and whether they get to enjoy sport at all.
If there is no planet, there is no sport.
For Nike, this means thinking about how we design and make our product all the way through to how our products are delivered all over the world – and we’ve made a clear choice – it won’t be through the Arctic.
We’ve made a commitment to not intentionally allow our products to be shipped on vessels via any Arctic sea route. And, we’re partnering with Ocean Conservancy, a leading advocate for the oceans and waterways, to encourage all companies and industries to make the same commitment through the Arctic Shipping Corporate Pledge (“Pledge”).
We’re joined in making this Pledge by Bestseller, Columbia, Gap Inc., H&M Group, Kering, Li & Fung, PVH Corp., and ocean carriers CMA CGM, Evergreen, Hapag-Lloyd and Mediterranean Shipping Company, all companies who are helping to preserve the Arctic through their commitment.

Not just because it’s home to the iconic polar bear, and four million people, but also because it helps keep our world’s climate in balance.
Arctic sea ice acts as a huge white reflector at the top of the planet, bouncing some of the sun’s rays back into space, helping keep the Earth at an even temperature.
But man-made climate change means the Arctic has warmed over the past few decades – actually about twice as much as the global average.
As the sea ice melts there’s less to reflect the rays, and more heat is absorbed by the ocean, magnifying the warming effect.
The Arctic also helps circulate the world's ocean currents, moving cold and warm water around the globe.

Imagine an icy winter with temperatures below -30 degrees Fahrenheit. Animals migrate south en masse, the days grow dark as the sun hangs low on the horizon and snow lingers on the ground for months.
For the 400,000 Indigenous people living in the Arctic, this scenario reflects the reality of life in one of the world’s harshest climates. To survive in this environment, residents have had to get creative—a fact exemplified by the British Museum’s latest exhibition, “Arctic: Climate and Culture.”
Per the London museum’s website, the show—created in direct collaboration with Arctic communities—highlights Indigenous peoples’ ingenuity through artifacts including a centuries-old sealskin whaling suit, brightly beaded snow goggles and a wolverine fur–lined parka. In addition to presenting examples of Arctic cultures’ resilience, the exhibition places a stark focus on ice loss, erratic weather and other effects of climate change that threaten Indigenous communities’ way of life.
As Jonathan Jones writes for the Guardian, one of the around 280 items featured in “Arctic: Climate and Culture” is a 16th-century drawing of a warmly dressed Inuit woman holding her baby, who peeks out through a small opening in the hood. A nearby video shows how Arctic women use similar parka hoods to carry children today. The juxtaposition is striking, helping viewers understand why such objects have a prevailing usefulness.
The artifacts on view are rooted in tens of thousands of years of history. According to a British Museum blog post, recent archaeological finds testify to a Paleolithic settlement established near the Yana River in northeastern Siberia some 30,000 years ago. The site’s prehistoric residents hunted megafauna such as woolly mammoths and created bone and ivory artifacts, including weapons, sewing needles and bowls.
Per a statement, a recurring theme of the exhibition is Arctic peoples’ transformation of “traditional heritage to meet contemporary needs and safeguard their culture.“
Reviewing the show for the Evening Standard, Nancy Durrant points out that the region’s Indigenous inhabitants “have evolved their way of life over 30,000 years in harmony with the seasons and the flora and fauna with which they share this vast expanse.”
Though the specifics of these ecological interactions have changed over time, the basic premise remains the same, she adds: “They kill [animals], but they respect and sustain them.”
To make the most of scarce resources, Arctic peoples use every bit of the animals they hunt, transforming narwhal and caribou bones into sleds, salmon skin into bags, and seal guts into waterproof parkas.
“[D]espite the foreboding we feel when we think about the Arctic, here is a heartening encounter with a radical alternative to modern living,” writes Jones for the Guardian. “… Everybody makes stuff. Everyday objects are turned into things of beauty and magic.”
Climate change is an ever-present specter in “Arctic: Climate and Change.” One display detailed by the Evening Standard visualizes how quickly sea ice is melting. Other immersive photographs of the region’s contemporary landscape show viewers “exactly what we stand to lose,” in the words of National Geographic’s Gail Tolley.
The Arctic is warming at a rate of almost twice the global average, according to the World Wildlife Fund. Between 2018 and 2020, the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland reported in September, the region’s largest ice shelf shrank by almost double the size of Manhattan. Per the British Museum, scientists predict that the Arctic will be “ice-free” in the next 80 years.
But the exhibition doesn’t focus solely on the devastating effects of climate change; instead, it strikes a surprisingly optimistic tone, outlining a novel approach to contemporary living.
“The show directly addresses the essential question of how humans can live with the impacts of extreme weather,” says the museum’s director, Hartwig Fischer, in the statement. “The future and past come together in the present, united by the shared experiences of Arctic peoples.”

But not this year.
Following an extraordinary spring and summer of warm Arctic temperatures, and the shriveling of Arctic sea ice to its second lowest extent on record, the strait remained mostly ice-free into early December.
Taking advantage of the situation, two gargantuan liquified natural gas tankers — each measuring three football fields long — passed through the Bering Strait early in the month, one heading for ports in East Asia, and the other returning.
""This would have been utterly unthinkable even 10 years ago,” says Rick Thoman, an Arctic climate specialist at the University of Alaska Fairbanks.
Thoman is one of the general editors of the recently released Arctic Report Card for 2020 — a comprehensive annual assessment published for the past 15 years by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
""As we state in the report card, the transformation to a wholly different Arctic than our parents and grandparents knew is wholly underway,"" Thoman says. (For my full interview with Thoman, see the video embedded at the end of this story.)
For the 12 months between October of 2019 and September of 2020, Arctic surface temperatures on land were the second highest since at least 1900, according to the report.
Siberia was particularly hard hit, with record high temperatures and very early and rapid melting of snow. That contributed to ""unprecedented"" wildfire seasons in a large swath of the Eurasian Arctic.
For two years in a row, blazes in the sprawling Sakha region ignited earlier than ever seen before during the 20-year satellite record. The total area burned just between the months of March and June was nearly three times the 20-year mean.
Ordinarily, fires don't ignite north of treeline in Siberia until July. But this past year they were already blazing in May, thanks to warm temperatures, the very early snowmelt, and ""zombie fires"" that came back to life after lying dormant under the snow from the year before. Some of this year's blazes burned so far north that they came within miles of the Arctic Ocean.
In both 2019 and again in 2020, smoke from Siberian wildfires spread for thousands of miles, reaching all the way across the Pacific Ocean to the United States and Canada — and beyond. And according to a recent report in Nature, this past year the blazes belched a record 244 million tons of climate-warming carbon dioxide into the atmosphere — 35 percent more than in 2019.
""I kind of resist the language about ‘a new normal,' because there is no reason to think that in 30 years much of anything in the Arctic is going to look like it does today,"" Thoman says. ""The Arctic is in a transition, and there is absolutely no reason to think that this is not going to continue.""
The Polar Paradox
Just how different the Arctic ultimately will look will depend on how successful we are in reducing the emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases that are causing the Arctic to warm more than twice as rapidly as the global average. Although we actually are making some progress, it's arguably being hampered by development of Arctic oil and gas reserves.
Call it the ""polar paradox,"" a phenomenon epitomized by those giant liquified natural gas tankers cruising through a relatively ice-free Bering Strait in December. Even as Arctic nations give lip service to reducing greenhouse gas emissions to prevent dangerous climate change, they are taking advantage of a warmer climate to develop Arctic oil and gas reserves, which of course only enhances the warming in a self-reinforcing feedback loop.
""A more accessible Arctic, potentially at least, makes it easier to continue down the track we’ve been,” Thoman says.
That track promises to lead to valuable riches: The USGS estimates that about 30 percent of the world's undiscovered natural gas, and 13 percent of the undiscovered oil, may be found in the Arctic, mostly offshore. It amounts to some 90 billion barrels of oil, 1,669 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, and 44 billion barrels of natural gas liquids.
Drilling for those resources, and shipping it to markets, will never be easy in such a harsh environment. But as the climate has warmed, it has become increasingly feasible.
The liquified natural gas those tankers carried came from a giant $27-billion plant completed just a year ago on the shore of the gas-rich Yamal Peninsula in Russia's Arctic. It's part of a big play by Russia to develop oil and gas reserves in the high north.
The Northern Sea Route
Fifteen ice-breaking LNG tankers have been built to ship gas from the remote Yamal plant to Western Europe and East Asia using a shipping corridor called the Northern Sea Route. They are supposed to be capable of operating year-round. But for most other ships, the NSR usually is open just between June and October. This year, with early and rapid melting of sea ice, the route opened a month earlier.
This year, about 30 voyages to Asia were completed along the Northern Sea Route — a record number. Two years ago, just four voyages were completed. All told, ships carried 32 million tons of cargo along the route this year, up from a little more than 20 million tons in 2018.
Stretching for 2,800 miles across the top of Russia, the NSR is a much shorter option for shipping cargo between East Asia and Western Europe than the Suez Canal. For a ship making the entire passage, it cuts 8,000 miles from the journey and reduces transit time by 10 to 15 days.
Hoping to enable year-round use of the sea route, Russia has been on an icebreaker-building spree. In 2019, Russian President Vladimir Putin said the country would operate 13 heavy-duty icebreakers in the Arctic, most of them nuclear-powered.
This year, Russia launched what it says is the world's most powerful ice breaker, the 560-foot long Artika. Capable of breaking through ice nearly 10 feet thick, the ship took a detour to the North Pole on its shakedown cruise from St. Petersburg to its home port in Murmansk. Arktika reached the pole on Oct. 3, 2020.
The trip is not very likely to go down as one of the more demanding ones Arktika will face during its lifetime: The icebreaker had relatively scanty ice to break. That's in part because the edge of the sea ice had retreated farther north than ever seen before.
Russia isn't the only country that's racing to develop its Arctic fossil fuel reserves. Norway is heading down the same path too.
Norwegian Supreme Court: Arctic Drilling is Constitutional
On December 22, Norway’s Supreme Court rejected an effort to curtail the government's plans for oil exploration in the Arctic. In doing so, it rejected arguments from climate activists that the country’s constitutional right to a clean environment required that drilling be stopped. As a result of the decision, drilling sanctioned by permits given in 2016 can go forward, as can other plans.
In their decision, the judges said Norway was not legally responsible for emissions of carbon dioxide resulting from oil the country exports. In so many words, they said that's on the countries that burn the oil, not on Norway.
""The supreme court's brutal ruling was just another confirmation of the darkness,"" says Andreas Ytterstad, chair of Concerned Scientists Norway, and a researcher at Oslo Metropolitan University. ""I was depressed, to be frank with you, but I also think it was claryfing.""
What seems clearer than ever is that as long as demand continues for fossil fuels, we shouldn't expect countries like Norway and Russia to resist the economic temptation to meet that demand.
“National interests or corporate interests often diverge from planetary scale interests,"" Thoman observes. ""That’s the world we live in.”
And that means whether we like it or not, it really is on us.

It is a place of many contradictions, no more so than now, when economic activity is increasing and national, geostrategic interests are confronting established practices of international cooperation and rules and norms. Russian president Vladimir Putin’s speech at the Arctic International Forum in St. Petersburg earlier this month foreshadowed this confrontation. He portrayed Russia as a facilitator in the making the Northern Sea Route (NSR) “safe and commercially feasible” for all nations, even as Russia is acting in contravention of international law by charging application fees and harbor/navigation costs. (Russia views the NSR as an internal passage; the international community views it as an international passage.) Equally, though Putin has denied any military tension in the Arctic, Russia is sending new units and capabilities to the region, including a new Arctic rifle brigade and S-400 missile systems, and conducting live-fire naval drills. Three Arctic coastal nations and NATO members represented in the essays below—Canada, the Kingdom of Denmark, and the United States—are well aware of the contradictions, challenges, and opportunities presented by increased economic and military activity in the Arctic and are adjusting their strategies and resources accordingly. While each approach is unique, there are several common elements. These include an increased focus on maritime surveillance and situational awareness, investment in more sustainable, survivable platforms, and a doubling down on joint and whole-of-government approaches to reflect the multiple missions in the Arctic. Where there are differences, they mainly concern whether and how to address actions that challenge established norms and international law. In this edition of Northern Connections, CSIS brings you three experienced and distinguished practitioners on the topic of “Shifting Currents in the Arctic.” The first is Admiral Paul Zukunft (ret.), former commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard. In “Navigating the Fourth Coast,” Admiral Zukunft explains that, although advancing U.S. security interests in the Arctic has been a priority since 2013, the necessary U.S. investments have not followed. The 2017 U.S. Arctic Strategy is in need of an update, and it is only this year that the U.S. Navy received an appropriation to build a heavy icebreaker. It would require extensive planning and operational creativity for the United States to successfully conduct a freedom of navigation exercise through the NSR. Nevertheless, Admiral Zukunft argues the United States should conduct such an exercise now before the window of opportunity to ensure international norms is closed. Our second contributor is Major General Kim J. Jørgensen, commander of Denmark’s Joint Arctic Command in Nuuk, Greenland. He explains that, uniquely, the Kingdom of Denmark consists of Denmark, Greenland, and the Faroe Islands, located at the center of the Arctic. While Greenland and the Faroe Islands have considerable autonomy within the Kingdom, a number of tasks, including defense, are a Danish responsibility. Denmark works in close cooperation with the Greenlanders and Faroese as well as international partners to ensure the Arctic remains a peaceful, secure, and collaborative space. Major General Jørgensen highlights how the Kingdom of Denmark is expanding its capabilities and reach in the Arctic. This year, its two classes of frigates—equipped with new sensors, command and control, and weapons capabilities—will join its specialized Arctic naval vessels in operating as part of Joint Arctic Command for the first time. Maritime surveillance will also be enhanced by satellites and maritime surveillance aircraft from the Royal Danish Air Force, specially modified for the harsh Arctic environment. Our final voice is Rear-Admiral Craig Baines, commander of Canada’s Maritime Forces Atlantic. With more than 75 percent of its coastline in the Arctic region, Canada remains focused on ensuring maritime safety and security in the Arctic. Rear-Admiral Baines lays out Canada’s cooperative approach to the region, which involves working with indigenous peoples, across government departments, and with other nations through NATO. He highlights investments Canada is making to increase its sustainability and reach in the Arctic, such as the establishment of a new fueling facility in the north and deployment of Arctic and offshore patrol vessels fitted with ice-strengthened hulls, advanced communications networks, and sealift capability. The focus of all three former and current practitioners is to ensure that the Arctic remains a cooperative as opposed to competitive space, but it is clear that an increased focus and investment by Arctic coastal nations is required to meet this level of ambition.

BACK TO TOP Coast Guard photo by Petty Officer 1st Class Matt Miller. Navigating the Fourth Coast Admiral Paul Zukunft U.S. Coast Guard (retired) In mid-winter 2016, as commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard, the White House’s Arctic Executive Steering Committee asked me what milestones had been achieved regarding the implementation of the 2013 National Strategy for the Arctic Region. One of the strategy’s top priorities was advancing U.S. security interests in the Arctic with an emphasis on preservation of freedom of the seas. Unfortunately, I had to report that no tangible progress in this area had been made. To rectify this, a concept of operations was developed to deploy the nation’s only heavy ice breaker, Coast Guard cutter Polar Star, on a freedom of navigation operation (FONOP) through the Northern Sea Route (NSR). The United States and most of the international community, including the European Union, recognize the NSR as an international strait. Russia views the route as internal waters. There is a similar challenge with the Northwest Passage (NWP): the United States and the international community view the passage as an international strait, but Canada views the passage as internal waters. When the United States conducted its last freedom of navigation operation (FONOP) in the Arctic in 1988 through the NWP, the United States notified and received the consent of the Canadian government. The United States has not conducted a FONOP through the NSR since the earliest days of the Cold War when scientific vessels were deployed. In the mid-1960s, the United States tested the NSR but was turned back by the Soviet Union. Could the United States attempt to conduct a FONOP today through the NSR? Back in 2016, the Polar Star was entering its 40th year of service, was operating mostly in the Antarctic, and was mission capable only by virtue of cannibalizing obsolete parts from her sister ship, Polar Sea. The potential of the Polar Star experiencing a catastrophic engineering casualty while in transit through the NSR was a valid concern, as was the specter of having to call upon Russia to render assistance. It was with this in mind that I weighed the White House’s request but ultimately decided it was not feasible. To date, the United States has yet to demonstrate freedom of navigation through the NSR, although the secretary of the Navy announced in January 2019 that the United States will conduct a limited FONOP off the Aleutian Islands later this year. This would be the first time the U.S. Navy has conducted such an operation in the Arctic. The effort is still in the planning phase, with ports and ships yet to be identified, but it is an important step in improving the Navy’s ability to operate in the far north. Why is it important for the United States to ensure freedom of navigation in the Arctic? Sea ice continues to recede to the point where scientists project seasonal periods of an entirely ice-free Arctic Ocean. Ice capable vessels and China’s medium icebreaker, Xue Long , are already transiting the NSR during the relatively ice-free season (late summer to early fall), albeit under Russian icebreaker escort. Liquified natural gas tank ships from multiple flag states are transporting this product from the Russian Arctic to international markets. Through its Northern Sea Route Administration, Russia charges application fees and associated harbor and navigation costs, which contradicts the UN Law of the Sea Convention, without consequences. By doing so, Russia is gradually setting a pattern of behavior designed to codify by customary practice the internal nature of and its sovereign control over the NSR. Given these developments, what, if anything, should the United States and other like- minded countries do to respond? The United States has limited options. The Navy does not have ice capable ships in its inventory. Although there is now an appropriation for $675 million for a heavy ice breaker for fiscal year 2019, there is not a contract among the competing shipyards nor the cutting of steel necessary to recapitalize the United States’ heavy icebreaker fleet within the next several years (the earliest delivery being 2024). Nevertheless, with some creativity and careful planning, the United States could feasibly conduct a FONOP in the Arctic, but it will require four elements: platforms, planning, command and control, and crew. In terms of a platform, the United States’ medium ice breaker, Healy, is a viable candidate for a FONOP, provided a few modifications are made.

Given these developments, what, if anything, should the United States and other like- minded countries do to respond? The United States has limited options. The Navy does not have ice capable ships in its inventory. Although there is now an appropriation for $675 million for a heavy ice breaker for fiscal year 2019, there is not a contract among the competing shipyards nor the cutting of steel necessary to recapitalize the United States’ heavy icebreaker fleet within the next several years (the earliest delivery being 2024). Nevertheless, with some creativity and careful planning, the United States could feasibly conduct a FONOP in the Arctic, but it will require four elements: platforms, planning, command and control, and crew.
In terms of a platform, the United States’ medium ice breaker, Healy, is a viable candidate for a FONOP, provided a few modifications are made. She can operate in temperatures as low as -50 degrees Fahrenheit, and she can break 4.5 feet of ice at a speed of 3 knots and 10 feet of ice by backing and ramming. In fact, she sailed to the North Pole unescorted on September 5, 2015. Healy was designed as a scientific research vessel and is outfitted with state-of-the-art laboratories, deck handling equipment, and scientific-related sensors to include unmanned aerial systems. She can hangar two HH-65 helicopters. That aside, Healy is not equipped with offensive and defensive armament systems and, as with all ships operating in the extreme high latitudes, has limited bandwidth that will impede real-time exchange of data and information absent either a dedicated space-based or fixed- wing relay station. If Healy were to be used for FONOP operations, it would be prudent to retrofit her with an array, augmented with technicians as well as watch standers to detect land, air, and maritime electronic emissions.
The second element is command and control. Under the 2011 Unified Campaign Plan, U.S. Northern Command and U.S. European Command share command and control authorities in the Arctic, but for this particular exercise, primacy would likely reside with Northern Command. Additionally, engagement from a number of government agencies, including the Department of Commerce, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. Coast Guard, the National Science Foundation, tribal liaisons, the State of Alaska, and the Department of State is needed. Joint Task Force Alaska, a subcomponent of Northern Command that is headquartered at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage, is the logical command and control repository. It would need to be expanded into a joint interagency task force (JIATF) and, ideally, be retitled JIATF-Arctic.
Third, there needs to be a focus on planning. A successful FONOP in the Arctic will require detailed planning to include a concept of operations, C4ISR, and clear rules of engagement. It should also incorporate branches and sequels to account for escalatory resistance and/or aggression from Russia. The United States should clarify in the plan and in official notifications that the FONOP would exercise a right of transit passage (as opposed to innocent passage). The United States views the NSR as an international strait (and not Russian internal waters) and maintains that the use of straight baselines by Russia to close these international straights is inconsistent with the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. Transit passage, which cannot be suspended, allows for “the exercise of freedom of navigation and overflight solely for the purpose of continuous and expeditious transit in normal modes of operation.” Importantly, this allows U.S. surface warships to transit in a manner necessary for their security, to include formation steaming and launch and recovery of aircraft.
Finally, there is the matter of crewing to include those augmentation detachments. In addition to Healy’s complement of 19 officers and 66 crew members, she can accommodate up to 51 additional personnel as dictated by the mission. To be successful, the United States needs to train the next generation of mariners to manage polar waters. The Navy’s renewed focus on surface navigation and the U.S. Marine Corps’ expanded cold-weather training are steps in the right direction. There is also an opportunity here for the Coast Guard to transfer its extensive experience in these areas to the Navy through training and mentoring arrangements; augmenting the Healy crew with U.S. naval personnel would provide valuable exposure to surface operations in ice conditions, something the Navy hasn’t done in over five decades.
The above elements provide a rough checklist for the National Security Council and other stakeholders to consider when weighing the merits and costs of conducting a FONOP in the Arctic. What is certain is that the landscape has changed dramatically since the release of the National Strategy for the Arctic Region in 2013. As the sea ice retreats at unprecedented rates, more of the Arctic Ocean is open to seafarers. The window of opportunity to ensure international norms are protected could be rapidly closing while Russia shapes customary practices and norms by exerting sovereignty over the NSR. The United States can either assert now or abdicate later.
Admiral Paul Zukunft (retired) served as the 25th Commandant of the United States Coast Guard from 2014-2018. He currently serves on the Advisory Board of The Center for Climate and Security.

Guardians of the Arctic Kingdom
Commander Danish Joint Arctic Command
The Kingdom of Denmark, which consists of Denmark, Greenland, and the Faroe Islands, is located at the center of the Arctic. While Greenland and the Faroe Islands have considerable autonomy within the kingdom, Denmark is responsible for defense.
The majority of Greenland lies above the Arctic Circle. Its area is vast and corresponds to one and a half times the area of Alaska. The conditions in Greenland are characterized by a challenging climate, extreme distances, limited population, and a lack of infrastructure that one must experience firsthand to fully understand the operational challenges. More than 80 percent of Greenland is covered by a permanent icecap up to three kilometers thick. Major parts of northern and eastern Greenland are uninhabited save the occasional military patrol or scientist and the U.S. Air Base at Thule in the northwest.
Today, significant changes are taking place in the Arctic, from climate change to technological developments. While these can bring new economic and development opportunities to the region, they also present new challenges. It is the objective of the Kingdom of Denmark – working within the Kingdom and with international partners – to ensure the Arctic remains a peaceful, secure, and collaborative space.
Danish Defense Priorities
The 2019-2020 Danish Foreign and Security Policy Strategy states that ensuring a peaceful Arctic with sustainable economic development is a priority for the Kingdom of Denmark. The Arctic features prominently both in the Defence Agreement (2018-2023) and Strategy for the Arctic (2011-2020).
The current Defence Agreement, which covers 2018-2023, substantially increases defense spending to bolster the capabilities of the Danish armed forces, with a particular emphasis on increasing Denmark’s contribution to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s collective defense, including in the Arctic. The agreement provides funding for programs to add area air defense capabilities to Royal Danish Navy (RDN) frigates and anti-submarine warfare sensors and weapons to a number of maritime and airborne platforms, establish a deployable mechanized brigade, continue funding for acquisition of modern combat aircraft (F-35) as replacement for the current F-16s, substantially increase cyber capabilities, and continue the process of strengthening the Danish Joint Arctic Command.
The Joint Arctic Command
The Joint Arctic Command is the Danish operational theater command for the Greenland and Faroe Islands areas. Our mission is to protect the kingdom in the Arctic. The command headquarters is in Nuuk, Greenland with units and installations spanning five time zones from western Greenland to the Faroe Islands. The Joint Arctic Command conducts operations year-round at sea, in the air, and on land (or on the ice). The majority of the units are dedicated to Arctic operations and have special skill sets needed in order to survive and operate in the Arctic environment. For example, the naval units are specially designed Arctic patrol frigates and vessels constructed for icy conditions, and they regularly assist civilian shipping with breaking the ice.
The Joint Arctic Command is a truly joint command directing maritime, air, and land units. The headquarters is staffed with personnel from the RDN, the Royal Danish Air Force (RDAF), the Royal Danish Army, the Danish Home Guard (equivalent of the U.S. National Guard), the Danish Emergency Management Agency, and civilian employees recruited locally in Greenland and the Faroe Islands. Reserves play an important role in daily and emergency manning. This joint approach reflects the diverse tasks of the Joint Arctic Command, which include upholding Danish sovereignty, conducting search and rescue, combating oil spills, policing the resources in the exclusive economic zone, supporting police and civilian authorities, and, ultimately, defense of Greenland and the Faroe Islands.
The Joint Arctic Command is in the process of expanding its capabilities and reach based on recent political decisions to improve Danish military presence and capability in the Arctic. A major part of the command’s daily operations is focused on maritime surveillance and establishing the best possible domain awareness in the area. Beginning this year, the specialized Arctic naval vessels will be joined by Denmark’s Iver Huitfeld-class and Absalon-class ships, which for the first time will operate as part of Joint Arctic Command. The ships will bring a host of new sensor, command and control, and weapon capabilities to the area and will herald a new chapter in Danish Arctic operations. These vessels are equipped with MH-60R Seahawk helicopters. Maritime surveillance is further enhanced by satellite surveillance and Challenger maritime surveillance aircraft from the RDAF, which are equipped with advanced sensors and modified for operations from snow, ice, or gravel strips in Greenland.
Denmark also has a formidable land capability in Greenland, where land operations are primarily conducted by special forces trained in Arctic operations. The primary unit is the Sirius Patrol, whose mobility is based on dog sleds—the traditional Greenlandic means of transportation that has proven best suited for the conditions in Greenland, where logistical support is often absent. After Arctic training, the Sirius Patrol soldiers are inserted into the uninhabited northeastern Greenland by air and patrol the area continuously for two years.
Recently, the Joint Arctic Command has begun focusing on improving interoperability with allies and partners. This often takes the form of exercises with the United States, Canada, Iceland, and, increasingly, France. In April 2019, the Joint Arctic Command for the first time participated in an exercise in the eastern Baltic Sea—far from Greenland and the Faroe Islands—offering an opportunity to exercise search and rescue operations with the Arctic nations cooperating in the Arctic Coast Guard Forum (i.e. United States, Canada, Russia, the Kingdom of Denmark, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, and Finland).
The Future
The next few years will be busy for the Joint Arctic Command as we continue to implement Danish political decisions on increasing our capability in the Arctic. We will integrate new units and capabilities, improve our headquarters functions, and intensify operational cooperation with allies and partners. We will establish local volunteer units based on the Home Guard model.
The Kingdom of Denmark is prepared to meet both its national and international obligations in the Arctic to ensure it remains a region characterized by peace and cooperation. In this regard, the Joint Arctic Command will improve its ability to contribute to Arctic security.
Major General Kim J. Jørgensen is an Air Force officer and commander of the Danish Joint Arctic Command since 2016. He is the Danish minister of defense’s primary advisor on affairs with Greenland and the Faroe Islands as well as general Arctic affairs related to defense.

Strong, Secure, and Engaged in the Canadian North
Commander, Maritime Forces Atlantic
The Arctic is relevant to all three of Canada’s core national security interests as defined in its national security policy: protecting Canada and Canadians at home and abroad, ensuring Canada is not a base for threats to its allies, and contributing to international security. The Canadian Arctic region encompasses more than 182,000 kilometers (or 75 percent), of the country’s national coastline with 36,563 islands. Not surprisingly, Canada is also home to the second largest search and rescue zone among all Arctic states. This region is a fundamental part of Canada, though its harsh climate and limited infrastructure present a challenge. Canada’s government is mandated to preserve the long-standing peace in the region in the face of growing global interests, and the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN) is well positioned to meet new demands critical to the safety and stability of the region.
Many government departments are responsible for providing essential services to northern communities and the Arctic region; however, they are limited in their resources and capacity, especially given the challenges of operating in the region. Canada’s defense policy, Strong, Secure and Engaged, recognizes that keeping the Canadian north secure requires cooperation with the peoples of the north, other government partners, and allies in order to advance shared interests on safety and security in the region. This includes cooperation with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
With that in mind, the RCN is in the process of launching six Harry DeWolf-class (HDW) Arctic patrol vessels in the next 6 years, with the first being brought to service in 2019. HDW vessels have a range of 6,800 nm with 120 days of logistical endurance. The ships are fitted with a Polar Class 5 ice-strengthened hull, which allows for year- round operations in one-meter-thick first-year ice with multi-year ice inclusions. The communications on board these ships are designed to provide robust and consistent connection to classified and unclassified networks. HDW vessels can operate and maintain 1 helicopter for up to 120 days and embark 22 mission-specific personnel and 4 small boats. Additionally, it is fitted with a vehicle bay and a laydown area to support a 70-ton sealift capability.
To enable sustained presence and shipping operations in the north, the RCN has gone further to establish a new fueling facility repurposed from an iron ore mining site in Nanisivik. With that said, Canada’s goal is not to militarize the Arctic. The Arctic is a region of low tension, and Canada’s defense policy seeks to maintain this. However, given the transnational nature of the threats Canada faces, it is difficult to separate security in Europe and the North Atlantic from security in our north.
The HDW vessels are designed specifically for the Canadian Arctic and to support a whole of government approach to ensuring Arctic sovereignty as the top priority. The high endurance and utility features of HDW vessels will aid the Canadian government in dealing with the increasing Arctic traffic in multiple ways. First, the ice-strengthened hull will enable these ships to study the ocean floor of sparsely surveyed Arctic waters and report ice observations to assist the Canadian Hydrographic Service and the Canadian Ice Service—both of which are essential for maritime safety and navigation
in Canada’s Arctic. Second, HDW vessels will work with the Canadian Coast Guard and various international partners to conduct search and rescue, as well as disaster relief, with its helicopter, enhanced communication technology, and utility capacities. In the event of a larger scale operation, HDW vessels can act as the on-scene commander and as a “command” platform to direct and inform other participating units. HDW vessels will work with domestic partners for law enforcement in the region, especially for shipping safety and environmental stewardship. These ships will serve as a platform for science and research in order to strengthen Canada’s position as a leader in polar science and technology and to promote the development and distribution of knowledge of other circumpolar regions, including Antarctica. HDW vessels will serve as an alternate platform to support important scientific work aimed at upholding Canada’s claims that the waters of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago are internal waters to Canada and the Canadian Arctic continental shelf extends to the North Pole. Last but not least, HDW vessels will help address critical gaps in situational awareness in the Arctic and provide technology that can exploit tactical data while employing unmanned aircraft and service systems. This includes contributing to the Recognized Maritime Picture and Common Operating Picture to support mission-critical decisionmaking and strategic planning in the region for domestic and international partners.
Canada has both domestic and international obligations to fulfill in the Arctic. Increased shipping, resource development, tourism, and human activity concerns will lead to security and safety issues, which will require the Canadian Armed Forces’ to support civilian agencies. Notwithstanding, there are many milestones to be achieved before Canada’s Arctic can be perceived as less austere than it is today. In time, a whole of government approach to the Arctic will develop new models and partnerships with private enterprise to meet domestic and international obligations.

We've all seen the pictures: a forlorn polar bear stranded on an ice floe - the living symbol of global warming melting the ice caps.
We worry for the polar bears, but most of us are unaware that Arctic melting could be just as dangerous for us.
""What happens in the Arctic does not stay there,"" Gail Whiteman, Director of the Pentland Centre for Sustainability at Lancaster University told Davos 2020.
""What's at stake in the Arctic is actually the future of humanity itself.""
Here are extracts from Professor Whiteman's introduction to the discussion What's at stake: the Arctic:
Earth's circulation system
The Arctic is an incredibly important system in the global climate system. So just like the Amazon is the lungs of the world, the Arctic is like our circulation system and feeds in to global climate change everywhere.
Science also tells us that the Arctic is in crisis. We know based on observational data that we have lost 50% of Arctic ice in about 50 years.
Albedo effect
So just when the World Economic Forum was starting the Arctic was very white and over that time period it is increasingly blue. Now, why would we care? Well, we care because of the 'albedo effect'.
And that is the thing in climate science where if something is white, it bounces off sunlight back out into the atmosphere and it doesn't absorb.
As the Arctic Ocean and the glaciers have melted we see that dark blue is absorbing more and more heat which is feeding through the rest of the system...
Since the 1970s, we have lost 75% of the volume of Arctic summer sea ice.
If you think of that as the insurance policy for the rest of the world to prevent catastrophic runaway climate change we are in trouble...
Permafrost and methane
And then we can see that the permafrost is thawing. Now, permafrost, of course, releases methane which is a concentrated [greenhouse] gas.
And if all the permafrost in the Arctic is released that is like adding in the CO2 emissions of all EU countries...
Extreme weather
If we take a look at extreme weather we can see that the Arctic plays a key point. Now, certainly the Arctic had its own fires. We saw that in Siberia. We see that in various parts.
But on top of that because of the way the Arctic affects the jet stream, it affects crazy weather all throughout the middle latitudes.
So if you remember the Sonoma fires of last year that is related to the Arctic change because of how it affects the jet stream.
If we take a look at Australia the Arctic does not have a direct correlation with those fires.
But indirectly, because we are driving global climate change because of the loss of the albedo effect that will affect things like severe weather and fires everywhere.
It's not just fires. It's also the hurricanes. It's the polar vortex coming down through Europe and North America.
Sea levels
On top of that, though, we can see that with the Greenland ice sheet, we are accelerating sea level rise.
If we get to a 2 degree warmer world we can see from some of the major cities around the world including Tokyo and New York, that they will indeed be flooded.
If we stay at the 1.5 Paris aspirational target we will save the Arctic summer sea ice.
Two degrees is not safe; 1.5 definitely is.
So from a scientific perspective, from my perspective, the Arctic is a barometer of global risk.
What happens in the Arctic does not stay there.
And what's at stake is not a geopolitical question alone or the short term economic benefits from shipping or extraction. What's at stake in the Arctic is actually the future of humanity itself.",,Robin Pomeroy,Arctic,World Economic Forum|WEF|Davos|Klaus Schwab|globalization|globalization4.0|globalization4|globalization four|what does globalization mean?,2020-01-23,World Economic Forum

Scientists and designers are proposing radical ways to 'refreeze' the Arctic
If planting more trees can replenish forests and remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, then could we also repopulate the Arctic with ice?
That's a question posed by a team of Indonesian designers with an eye-catching response to the climate crisis: iceberg-making submarines.
The idea, recently named runner-up in an international design competition appealing for radical approaches to sustainability, is the latest in a series of new proposals for ""refreezing"" the Earth's poles -- from sprinkling them with artificial sand to blasting seawater into the sky to brighten the clouds.
Led by 29-year-old architect Faris Rajak Kotahatuhaha, the group envisaged a submersible vessel capable of producing 16-foot-thick, 82-foot wide hexagonal icebergs.
The process would begin with the submarine dipping beneath the surface to fill its central cavity with seawater. Salt would then be filtered out, raising water's freezing point by more than 3 degrees Fahrenheit, after which a hatch closes over the chamber to protect it from the sun.
An iceberg would then form naturally inside, before being ejected a month later. According to the team behind the project, the hexagonal shape may encourage the icebergs (or ""ice babies"" as Kotahatuhaha refers to them) to interlock with one another and form larger frozen masses.
It's an early concept design, and many questions remain. The designers are yet to finalize how the vehicle would be powered, though they intend for the vessel to be fully sustainable. But could the submarines, in theory, work?
Andrew Shepherd, a professor of Earth observation at the UK's Leeds University, described the idea as an ""interesting engineering solution,"" though he questioned the project's scalability. He estimated that replacing polar ice at the same rate it has disappeared in the last four decades would require around 10 million submarines.
""That's a lot of machines,"" Shepherd said in an email. ""For context, that's not far off the total number of Model-T Fords built in all time.""
But for Kotahatuhaha, the proposal is not only about feasibility -- it's about finding a different way to approach climate challenges.
""The Arctic has lost ice from year to year in the last decade,"" he said on the phone from Jakarta. ""So we tried to solve the problem through a different way of thinking.
""Richer countries have millions to spend on (sea walls and) protection, but what about poor countries with no budget for (defending against) rising sea levels? This is a problem the world now faces together. We have a different approach: Rather than defending against sea level rises, we think it's better (to carry out) some kind of intervention to tackle the problem.""
Protecting the poles
A possible flaw in the proposal -- and others like it -- is that making ice does not significantly alter sea levels. If the ice is still floating in the water it formed from, then sea's overall mass doesn't change. (The icebergs would have to be ""moved on to land"" if they were to lower sea levels, Shepherd said).
But reversing, or at least slowing, the alarming decline of polar sea ice is about more than rising oceans. Snow and ice reflect significantly more sunlight than open water does, so bigger, frozen surfaces mean more radiation is sent back to space.
""If enough (ice) is made, then it could ultimately alter the planet's temperature, which could in turn lead to reduced land ice melting and reduced sea level rise from that source,"" Shepherd said, offering an alternative advantage to making icebergs. ""But there are lots of 'ifs' along the way.""
Farfetched as it may sound, the idea of re-freezing the poles through geoengineering is being explored elsewhere in academia. In 2017, a team of researchers at Arizona State University revealed a concept for a wind-powered pump that sucks up seawater and sprays it out onto the ice's surface, where it will freeze faster.
The scientists' research suggested that using 10 million of the devices could add a meter (3.2 feet) onto the surface of a polar ice sheet over the course of a winter.
Other proposals have focused on protecting ice rather than creating it.
Since 1990, British physicist John Lanham has explored a technique known as marine cloud brightening, in which particles -- such as the salt in seawater -- are injected into clouds to increase the amount of sunlight they reflect. Together with Stephen Salter, a professor of engineering design at the University of Edinburgh, Lanham developed a concept design for a floating ""spray vessel"" which could fire seawater into the clouds via a series of masts.
Brighter clouds could mean that less sunlight reaching the Earth's surface, thus reducing summer melting and encouraging the replenishment of ice during the winter.
Elsewhere, the US non-profit group Ice911 has spent the last decade developing a highly reflective sand-like material that can be scattered on ice to protect it from the sun's rays.
Last year, the group tested its ""hollow microspheres,"" which are made from silicate glass, over 15,000 square meters (3.7 acres) of frozen lake in Alaska. Researchers found that treated ice was thicker and more reflective than untreated ice.
Detractors say that plans to refreeze the Arctic address the symptom, not the cause. Indeed, even if proposals did prove feasible, none would combat the carbon consumption responsible for diminishing sea ice in the first place.
As Julienne Stroeve, a professor at University College London and senior scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center, told CNN when the Arizona State University's team first proposed its wind-powered pump concept: ""Global warming in response to rising CO2 concentrations would continue despite efforts to grow ice in the Arctic. Thus, the excess heat at lower latitudes would still be transported towards the Arctic via atmospheric and oceanic circulation and this would counter efforts to grow ice in the Arctic.""
But for Kotahatuhaha and his team, big problems require bold innovation. While he accepts that his iceberg-making submarines are a ""utopian project,"" he wants experts from different fields to help build radical visions into viable solutions.
""Architects cannot build skyscrapers alone,"" he offered as an analogy. ""(They) need collaboration from civil engineers, electrical engineers, economists and others.
""If there are too many limitations, there will be no innovation,"" he added. ""Innovation is the first step to opening (our) way of thinking, then technology and research regarding ... feasibility must be deepened.""",,"Oscar Holland, CNN",,,2019-09-02,CNN

The Arctic Circle, fraught with melting polar ice caps, is becoming a key stage for global competition and potentially for the escalation of a great power conflict in the near future.
As the Arctic's treacherous polar ice caps melt away, nations have begun to engage in a modern gold rush over the region’s unclaimed territory, natural resources, and strategic position. As a consequence of the rapidly disappearing polar ice caps, there has been an increase in unclaimed ocean and land territory, beyond any nation’s control, that countries are attempting to gain jurisdiction over for purposes, such as resource extraction and trade routes. Beyond economic motivations, nations such as the United States, Russia, and China are competing in the region to project military supremacy and seek more power. The Arctic also sits at a critical position between North America and Eurasia, making it a powerful strategic position from which to project military strength. As the liberal international order is increasingly under threat by great power conflict (a scenario in which the already-contentious relationship among the United States, Russia and China could devolve into war), the Arctic Circle faces a crossroads: will the underlying boiling tensions explode to the point of larger global conflict or can diplomatic means be the key to ensuring peace in the region?
A 2018 National Aeronautics and Space Administration report estimated that the Arctic has lost 21,000 square miles of sea ice per year in the last five decades, opening up more territory on the narrowing strip of land for controlling and cultivating. Control over Arctic territory has given nations the ability to settle it, extract resources, and establish military outposts, making legal rights and claims over such territory incredibly valuable. Most legal matters concerning the region are determined by The Arctic Council: an intergovernmental organization that encourages cooperation in the region. Its key nation members are those that border the Arctic: the United States of America, Russia, Canada, Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, and Iceland. Currently, Russia and Canada have claimed the most land in the region, which is demonstrative of the scope of their influence in the region. Beyond the eight neighboring countries, there are also thirteen observer countries affiliated with the Arctic Council, such as China, Germany, and India. The difference in roles between member nations and observer countries, in many cases, can be seen in their stated reasons for being in the region. For example, the United States and Russia have previously justified their territorial expansion due to their proximity to the region, while China is more explicit about resources motivating their involvement in the region. The combination of a finite, yet growing amount of claimable territory as well as the perception of a zero-sum game have set these nations on a collision course for potential conflict. Consequently, the Arctic Council works to resolve disputes by publishing agreements and focusing on sustainability and environmental protection of the Arctic. The melting polar ice caps and ensuing territorial debates have set the stage for the magnification of the Arctic Council’s global role.
The competition over land claims is driven in part by nations' desire for the region’s natural resources, specifically natural gas, which provides almost a quarter of all global energy usage. Most natural gas supplies around the world have already been explored and exploited, but the Arctic presents a vast untapped reserve over which nations are vying for control. A US Geological Survey estimates that the region has 1,699 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and various other fuels, equal to the entirety of Russia’s oil reserves and three times as much as those of the United States.
The United States, Russia, and China are the primary nations competing for control of the Arctic’s resources. Parties to the United Nations Convention for the Law of the Sea are entitled to resources that are within 370 kilometers of their shorelines, but most of the natural gas resources in the Arctic are beyond these legal borders. This distance creates a scramble to control these resources that goes beyond the influence of international organizations, stimulating further intra-nation conflict. As such, even nations that are far away from the Arctic are beginning to involve themselves in its affairs, such as China, whose interests lie in the resources that the Arctic holds rather than the land itself. China has few domestic energy resources with most of its energy consumption reliant on foreign imports from the Middle East, the United States, and Russia, which drives its ambition to tap Arctic natural gas to secure energy independence. China’s Arctic ambitions lay beyond merely energy however, as they have recently expanded their plans to take advantage of the nation’s resources in the state of legal confusion.
The Chinese Government has dubbed their involvement in the Arctic region as the “Polar Silk Road,” which is an allusion to the trade routes that they intend on pursuing following the acquisition of natural resources. China’s legal claim to the region differs from many other nations due to their lack of a land border to the Arctic, complicating their efforts. Chinese companies such as Shenghe Resources, China Nuclear Hua Sheng Mining, China National Petroleum Corp., and China National Offshore Oil Corporation have attempted to expand their mining projects in the region, but have found bureaucratic barriers and political opposition coming from the Danish, who control Greenland. Furthermore, China is outnumbered by its primary competitors, the United States and Russia, who have been operating in the region for far longer and have more experience in resource extraction. China’s one icebreaker, known as “The Xuelong 2” or “The Snow Dragon 2”, pales in comparison to the United States’ five icebreakers and Russia’s 51 icebreakers. The recent construction of “The Xuelong 2” has motivated the United States to ramp up production of icebreakers, including a plan to launch three more by 2029. The icebreakers are representative of the larger cat-and-mouse game that is emerging by the three nations, in which they attempt to pre-empt the other two countries and respond in kind to an opposing nation’s expansion in the region.
Outside of great power conflict, the rush for resources, especially fossil fuels such as natural gas, causes serious environmental impacts. As countries expand their drilling in the Arctic Circle, further erosion and harm to local species could occur as a result. Arctic drilling could exacerbate the damage that has already been done in the region with potential oil spills, which could devastate wildlife populations. In spite of these environmental consequences, the nations embroiled in the Arctic Circle conflict appear poised to further develop their drilling programs primarily for economic reasons. Economic benefits would resonate domestically in each country due to job creation, lower costs of energy, and energy independence, and would also extend to more favorable and profitable international trade. The conflict in the Arctic Circle mirrors many of the dynamics present in the South China Sea conflict, in which a competition over access to strategic positions and trade routes has expanded into a more overt conflict between great powers who see each other’s actions as actively hostile. Similarly, the non-binding nature of Arctic Council resolutions and the lack of enforcement powers limit the body’s ability to regulate the conflict at a time when peaceful negotiation and cooperation might be needed the most. The legal protections for the Arctic and its resources are no longer as effective in preventing competition.
The need to preserve these geopolitical and economic interests have motivated nations to bring a military presence to the region. Russia’s Red Arctic objective has propelled them to maintain its military presence through its numerous airbases and border outposts. Russia has recently flaunted its military might in the region through its August 2019 Ocean Shield Exercise, demonstrating its capability to conduct military operations in the region and to deter other nations from interfering. Russia’s military motivations in the region stem from its need to project strength, its perceived defensive needs, and its protection of economic interests in the region. Meanwhile, the United States currently has one airbase, the Thule Air Base, located in northern Greenland. In 2017, the United States invested US$40 million in improving the Thule Air Base due to Russia’s escalation of military presence in the region. The Air Base’s location is uniquely strategic given that it sits at almost the exact midway point of Washington DC and Moscow. The implications of the Thule Air Base for conflicts outside of the Arctic can not be understated as it could detect any incoming missile from Russia, North Korea, or China. The US-Russia dynamic in the Arctic Circle region is reminiscent of the Cold War, and while the two militaries have not come into direct conflict, their constant parade of military exercises and increasing military investment in the region set the collision course for a conflict that might erupt, especially as the territory is rapidly decreasing in land mass
The growing military competition over the Arctic has the potential to draw in even more nations. A 2019 US Department of Defense report speculated that China might be exploring the logistical possibilities of establishing a military presence in the region. The addition of a third global power’s military in the region could be the catalyst to a direct confrontation between the competing nations, but this potential larger battle could provide an opportunity for the Arctic Council to step up as a peacemaker in the region. The lack of international legal protections in the region creates a need for cooperation and diplomacy that could prevent escalating tensions. Resources and land are inherently finite, which makes the regional expansion a zero-sum game. The presence of armies heightens the already contentious dynamic in the region by allowing for the possibility of miscalculation. Although the risk of intentional military escalation might be apparent, the possibility of accidental conflict escalation in the region also remains a looming threat. Even though the tantalizing opportunity of acquiring more land and resources might not be enough incentive to lure global leaders into a devastating conflict that would cost many human lives, but simply having the military in the region might be enough to start a conflict that ends up spilling over into other regions such as the aforementioned South China Sea and the Middle East. This potential military conflict makes the Arctic Council’s role as a mediator crucial for preventing military conflict and for attempting to bring peace to the region.
As polar ice caps continue to melt, more unclaimed territory will become available for drilling and trade routes and, as a result, the potential to acquire more resources would increase as well. The real possibility that nations will become economically and militarily invested in the region means that media members and the general public ought to pay more attention to its geopolitics. Even as the conflicts between the United States and Russia and the United States and China gain more attention in the media, the Arctic Circle deserves to be among the forefront of those discussions. The actions and rhetoric of the United States, China, and Russia have and will continue to influence each other in the region. Consequently, expanding involvement in the region can be viewed by the other nations as a threat to their regional interests and has, in the past, pitted these countries against each other. Diplomatic means to resolve the conflict, such as the Arctic Council, exist, but questions remain about their ability to resolve the conflict and create agreements that are actually adhered to. The 2020s decade could prove to be the pivotal moment for the Arctic Council’s influence in the region and provide faith in cooperative international organizations. The implications of a successful Arctic Council resolution could increase the credibility, in the minds of skeptics, of other organizations which have recently had doubt cast upon them such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the United Nations. Conversely, a negative ending to the regional conflict could extend beyond the region into a larger war in multiple regions. Although the Arctic Circle is characterized by its geographical position at the top of the planet, right now, it appears to be the center of the world.

They also have opposite land-sea arrangements. In the Arctic there is an ocean surrounded by continents, while the Antarctic is continent surrounded by oceans. These differences in the arrangement of land and water contribute to differences in each polar region’s climate, oceanic and atmospheric circulation patterns, and sea ice — all of which were on display in 2011.
The Arctic
Temperature
In 2011, virtually the entire Arctic was warmer than the long-term average. This continued a trend of overall warming of about 3.6°F since the mid-1960s, which is more than double the temperature increases occurring at lower latitudes. The warmth led to a new record-low June snow cover extent and duration in the eastern Arctic (northern Europe and Russia).
Meanwhile, in the western Arctic, the town of Barrow, on the North Slope of Alaska, experienced a record string of 86 consecutive days with minimum temperatures at or above freezing. The warmth continues to sink in: new record high temperatures occurred at depths of 20 meters at all permafrost observatories on the North Slope.
Sea ice
At winter maximum in March, sea ice extent was 5.6 million square miles, 7.7 percent below the 1979-2000 average. At summer minimum, ice extent was 1.7 million square miles—the second-smallest extent in the satellite record and 31 percent below the 1979-2000 average.
Long-term trends in Arctic ice remain consistent with a warming climate. Both winter maximum (March) and summer minimum (September) ice extents are shrinking: -2.7 percent per decade for March, and -12.0 percent per decade for September. Old, thick ice continues to decline. In 2011, the amount of four- and five-year-old ice was just 19 percent of the 1982-2005 mean.
Surface melt on the Greenland Ice Sheet
The surface of the Greenland Ice Sheet experienced dramatic melting during the summer of 2011. The melt detected between June-August was the third largest since satellite records began in 1979, and the duration of the melt season was 30 days longer than the 1979-2010 average. The entire ice sheet had a lower albedo–meaning it was less reflective–than average, especially in western Greenland. Between surface melt and icebergs from calving glaciers, Greenland lost an estimated 422 gigatons of ice in 2011.
The Antarctic
Temperature
Overall, Antarctic temperatures were above average in 2011, but they were extremely variable from season to season. From January through April (summer and early fall), temperatures were near average across most of the region, but became colder than average in May and June.
July through November (winter and spring) brought a sharp reversal. Temperatures across much of the continent were more than 5.4°F warmer than the 1981-2010 average. December saw a return to near-normal temperatures for most of the continent, although temperatures at South Pole station hit an all-time record high of 9.9°F on December 25, 2011.
Sea Ice
Whereas Arctic sea ice extent was consistently below average throughout 2011, Antarctic sea ice was more variable. From summer through late fall (mid-January to mid-May), sea ice extent was well below average, including some short time periods when it hit record lows.
From winter through mid-spring (mid-November), ice extent stayed near the mean, except for a dip from mid-June to mid-July. From mid-November through the end of 2011, however Antarctic sea ice extent was much above average.
Surface Melt on Antarctic Ice Sheets
Over the 2010/2011 summer, roughly 412,888 square miles of the snow- and ice-covered surface of Antarctica experienced melting. This is a much smaller than average melt area based on data from recent decades, but it is larger than last year.
Explaining the differences between Arctic and Antarctic sea ice
This year’s state of the climate report confirms that signs of a warming climate are everywhere in the Arctic: rising temperatures, retreating and thinning sea ice, reduced snow cover, warming permafrost, shrinking glaciers, and thinning ice sheets. In the Antarctic, on the other hand, signs of change due to global-scale warming are absent or inconclusive. Why are the Arctic and Antarctic so different?
One thing worth keeping in mind is that global average surface temperature is rising, but not all regions are warming. Earth’s climate continues to show natural variability from place to place and year to year, and different regions experience different feedbacks that balance or amplify global-scale warming or cooling.
Another thing to keep in mind is that the Arctic and the Antarctic aren’t mirror images of each other. Greenland, for instance, is not as far north as Antarctica is south, so Greenland has longer, warmer summers, providing more opportunity for surface melting.
Differences in the nature of each hemisphere’s sea ice are equally dramatic. Arctic sea ice covers the North Pole, and the surrounding land limits how far south it can expand in the winter. This confinement also means that much of the ice is prevented from migrating to lower latitudes in the summer, where it would more easily melt. The arrangement has historically allowed the Arctic to sustain a comparatively large ice pack year round.
In the Southern Hemisphere, however, the Antarctic continent occupies the southernmost—coldest—part of the hemisphere. Sea ice forms in the winter around the margins of the continent, and it is free to expand, producing a winter extent that is much larger than the Arctic’s. The flip side, however, is that in the summer, the ice is not only at a lower (warmer) latitude, but it is free to drift away. Historically, that has meant that Antarctic sea ice nearly disappears in the summer.
Big decreases in summertime sea ice, then, are more unusual in the Arctic than the Antarctic, and it sets up a process known as “Arctic amplification” of climate change. Because of its light appearance, sea ice reflects most of the Sun’s energy back into space, but as the ice melts, the dark surface of the ocean is exposed. In Antarctica, the summertime exposure of large expanses of dark ocean is normal, but in the Arctic, it isn’t.
Below-average ice extents lead to more sunlight being absorbed by the ocean, which leads to more warming (of both the water and the overlying air), which leads to more melting. The years 2007-2011 experienced the five lowest Arctic sea ice minimum extents in the satellite record, and the years 2002-2011 experienced nine of the ten lowest minima on record.

Arctic countries need to lead the cut of CO2
The hottest temperature ever measured above the Arctic circle was recorded in Verkhoyansk, Siberia this past June. In fact, the + 38.6°C reading was just one of many highs that made June 2020 in Siberia five degrees warmer than any June from 1981 to 2010. A recent Oxford University-led study shows man-made climate change due to carbon emissions made this Siberian heatwave 600 times more likely. Read more
The Arctic is warming at a rate of almost twice the global average.
Without urgent action to cut greenhouse gas emissions, the world will continue to feel the effects of a warming Arctic: rising sea levels, changes in climate and precipitation patterns, increasing severe weather events, and loss of fish stocks, birds and marine mammals.
Why it matters
The average temperature of the Arctic has increased 2.3°C since the 1970s.
By 2100, polar bears could face starvation and reproductive failure even in far northern Canada.
Around 35,000 walruses came ashore on the Alaska coast in September 2014. It’s the largest ‘haul out’ ever recorded. US government agencies estimated that 60 young walruses were crushed in the crowd.
Warmer winter temperatures have also increased the layers of ice in snow, making food more difficult to dig up in winter.
Fish stocks in the Barents Sea are moving north at up to 160 kilometres per decade as a result of climate change.
The fish are sensitive to changes in water temperature. This poses a risk for commercial and subsistence fisheries that may see fish resources move away from where they can harvest them. The moving fish also change the ecosystems into which they move.
On the tundra, rising temperatures have brought a new competitor - the Arctic fox’s much larger cousin, the red fox. Not only does the newcomer colonise their dens, it can also kill the smaller Arctic foxes.
In the ocean, both scientists and Inuit say killer whales appear to be increasing in numbers, and in the length of time they stay in the Arctic. Killer whales prey on narwhals and bowhead whales.
With increased shipping comes spill risk (both fuel and cargo), “black carbon” emissions that help to speed the rate of Arctic melting, ship noise that may also affect whales, and icebreaking that can disrupt ice crossing routes for people and animals.
In 2013, a large bulk carrier transited the Northwest Passage for the first time. In 2018, the first cargo ship transited the Arctic north of Russia.
Reduced ice cover is making offshore oil production in the Arctic more commercially viable. In 2014, the first commercial development of offshore oil (Prirazlomnoye) was pumped from Russian Arctic waters.
Our solutions
How we work
Communicating a warming Arctic
WWF brings the effects of climate change in the Arctic to a global audience, and makes the connections between Arctic warming and global impacts.
Helping highly endangered seals
As Finland's climate warms, the country is seeing less snow cover. WWF is helping the extremely endangered Saimaa ringed sealsfind suitable places to nest by creating man-made snow banks.
Planning a future for the Last Ice Area
WWF is looking at the future management of the ""Last Ice Area"", the place where summer sea ice is projected to persist longest.
Promoting renewable energy
WWF is advocating for renewable energy, and piloting renewable solutions with some Arctic communities.
Protecting the Last Ice Area in Greenland
The Last Ice Area will be essential as an enduring home for ice-dependent life. WWF-Denmark has made a proposal to include the Greenland section of the Last Ice Area on the tentative list for UNESCO world heritage.
Recommending action for walruses
The first circumpolar report on walrus conservation recommends research into the effects of industrial activities on the Arctic animals.
Surveying polar bears in Western Hudson Bay
WWF supports polar bear surveys using an innovative mark-recapture technique that does not require tranquilising the bears.
Teaching the next generation
WWF works with Students on Ice to provide high school students a first hand experience of the effects of climate change in the Arctic.

Introduce the concepts of behavioral and biological adaptation.
Ask: What is an animal adaptation? Elicit from students that it is a trait that helps an animal fit in and survive in its environment. Explain to students that there are behavioral and biological adaptations. An example of a biological adaptation is a polar bear’s thick fur, which protects it from freezing temperatures. A thick-billed Murre that dives deep into the Arctic waters in search of fish and squid to eat is displaying a behavioral adaptation. Ask students for other examples of each type of adaptation.
2. Have students watch the video “Arctic Ocean.”
Show students the National Geographic video “Arctic Ocean” and ask them to pay particular attention to what the video segment says about animal life in this region. Tell them to look for examples of behavioral and biological adaptation as they watch. After the video, check students’ comprehension. Ask:
- What makes the environment so harsh and seemingly inhospitable? (thick ice; freezing temperatures; dark waters)
- What animals live in this environment? (polar bears, ringed seals, beluga whales, narwhals, bowhead whales, Arctic birds, walruses)
- What threatens Arctic animal life? How? (global warming; by melting the ice and snow animals and people depend on)
3. Have students research Arctic animals and complete the worksheet.
Divide students into small groups or pairs. Distribute the worksheet Arctic Animal Adaptations. Have students use the National Geographic Animals website and library resources. Ask them to research a specific Arctic animal, native to the Beaufort Sea and surrounding arctic regions, and the ways in which the animal has adapted to such a harsh environment. Assign small groups or pairs one of the following animals to research and have them complete the worksheet.
- albatross
- Arctic fox

The arctic tundra is a harsh environment that only the toughest plants and animals can survive in. The habitat has a long and brutal winter and the barren landscape provides many challenges. Below are some really neat facts about the arctic tundra!
Location:
The arctic tundra can be found in the northern parts of North America, Europe, and Asia. Most of the region is found within the Arctic Circle and above the edge of the coniferous forests—latitude 60°N in Canada and Siberia and latitude 70°N in the other countries. While the arctic tundra is confined to only the areas near the north pole, other areas that are part of the tundra biome can be found in Antarctica and certian cold, mountainous regions (alpine tundra).
True to its name, the arctic tundra is part of the tundra biome, which is very large (taking up about 20% of the earth's surface). Unfortunately, the arctic tundra is shrinking as a result of climate change; the increasing temperatures are causing the permafrost to melt.
Characteristics:
The arctic tundra has several distinct features that make it a unique habitat. The permafrost, barren landscape, and cold/dry climate of the arctic tundra are all important characteristics.
Permafrost (Frozen Ground):

Permafrost melting in the summer
Permafrost is very challenging to build on, which is one of the reasons that very few people inhabit the tundra. In the summer most of the arctic tundra is covered in marshes and bogs because the top soil melts, turning firm, frozen soil into soggy, melted soil. Even on solid ground in the winter, building on permafrost can cause the ground to melt underneath, which disrupts the foundation of the building.
Barren Landscape:
Cold and Dry Climate:
The arctic tundra is the coldest and driest place on the planet. In the tundra the fall and spring seasons are basically non-existent, leaving only two seasons—winter and summer.
Winter – The winter season is incredibly long, about 8 months. Since the arctic tundra is very close to the north pole, the nights are very long. At the deepest points in the winter the sun may be gone for several weeks straight. This leads to the very cold temperatures: with an average of -34°C during the winter and in the coldest days dipping as cold as -45°C. This is not to mention the harsh wind in the barren land, which can add a bitterness that makes the tundra feel even colder.

Summer – The summer season is very short in the arctic tundra (giving plants only 50-60 days to grow each year). The temperature is much warmer and usually ranges somewhere between 3°C and 12°C. A remarkable characteristic of the arctic tundra are the long days of the summer months. At the height of the summer the days last a full 24 hours. If it weren't for this short two month period the arctic tundra would not be a suitable habitat for animals and plants to survive.

In terms of precipitation the arctic tundra recieves approximately 10 inches in a whole year, sometimes even less! The precipitation mostly comes in the form of snow during the winter season; however, there is also the occasional rainy (or even snowy) day in the summertime.
Plants:
Due to the permafrost in the arctic tundra, plants that extend their roots deep into the soil (trees for example) are unable to grow. Despite the barren nature of the arctic landscape and harsh conditions of the tundra biome, there are several amazing plants that call the arctic tundra home.
Plants with shallow roots that sprawl across the ground or can grow on a rocky terrain can survive in the tundra. Lichen is an ideal plant for the tundra because it is able to grow on rocks or other places with very little soil and can withstand freezing temperatures for long periods of time. Interestingly, lichen is a combination of algae and fungus, which act in a symbiotic relationship—the algae is responsible for the photosynthesis and the fungus holds water in the plant in order to survive in the dry climate.

The summer season is incredibly short in the tundra biome, so it is important that plants make the most of the sun. During the summer the wildflowers bloom quickly and beautifully. There are 400 different flowers in the arctic tundra. Most of the flowers that survive in the tundra are perennials; they lay dormant in the cold winters and grow again from the same roots in the summer.
The ground of the arctic tundra is marshy and boggy during the summer, so plants must be able to survive in water-logged areas. Seasonal grass thrive anywhere there is a little bit of soil and enough water. You will often see clumps of grass growing in marshy areas of the arctic tundra.
The barren landscape leads to strong winds that make surviving in the tundra very difficult. Moss will grow in wide and thick clumps, but what looks like a giant plant is actually hundreds of little tiny plants growing closely together. Growing in bundles allows plants to be sheltered from the harsh conditions, so it is an effective adaptation for many plants in the tundra.
Animals:

Different adaptations include:
- being a large animal that is able to retain energy,
- extra layers of fur,
- large paws to help walk over snow and special hooves that can traverse the rocky barren landscape and dig for food underneath the snow,
- storing fat in the body,
- changing the color of fur from brown to white for the winter season,
- small ears and tails to prevent loss of heat.

The arctic tundra also has a rich history for the aboriginal people of North America because the tundra is home to the Inuit peoples. The Inuit people had to make their own adaptaions to living in the arctic tundra. There are many different families and groups of inuits, who are known for different things, for example:
- Copper Inuit – Living in regions with large copper desposits,
- Caribou Inuit – Hunting caribou to sustain life (they were very skilled in using all parts of the animal for food, shelter, clothing, and even tools),
- Nestilik Inuit – Living on the Arctic Coast; Nestilik actually means ""people of the place where there is seal"",
- Igloolik or Iglulik Inuit – Building igloo's for shelter in the snowy landscape,
- Western Arctic (formerly Mackenzie) Inuit – Living near the Mackenzie River.

The seasonal maximum extent of Arctic sea ice has passed, and with the passing of the vernal equinox, the sun has risen at the north pole. While there are plenty of cold days ahead, the long polar night is over. Arctic sea ice extent averaged for March 2021 was the ninth lowest in the satellite record. With little ice in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, harp seal pups are struggling. At month’s end, Antarctic sea ice extent was slightly above average.
Overview of conditions
Figure 1. Arctic sea ice extent for March 2021 was 14.64 million square kilometers (5.65 million square miles). The magenta line shows the 1981 to 2010 average extent for that month. Sea Ice Index data. About the data
Arctic sea ice extent averaged for March 2021 was 14.64 million square kilometers (5.65 million square miles). This was 350,000 square kilometers (135,000 square miles) above the record minimum set in 2017 and 790,000 square kilometers (305,000 square miles) below the 1981 to 2010 average. The average extent ranks ninth lowest in the satellite record, which began in 1979. Regionally, extent at the end of the month was below average on the Pacific side in the Bering sea and on the Atlantic side in the northern Barents Sea and well south of the Arctic in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Elsewhere, extent was close to the average, though generally somewhat lower. Ice loss during March was primarily in the Sea of Okhotsk, the southern edge of the Bering Sea, east of Svalbard, and in the northern part of the East Greenland Sea. The ice edge expanded in the southern part of the East Greenland Sea and to the north of Svalbard.
Conditions in context
Figure 2a. The graph above shows Arctic sea ice extent as of April 5, 2021, along with daily ice extent data for four previous years and the 2012 record low. 2020 to 2021 is shown in blue, 2019 to 2020 in green, 2018 to 2019 in orange, 2017 to 2018 in brown, 2016 to 2017 in magenta, and 2011 to 2012 in dashed brown. The 1981 to 2010 median is in dark gray. The gray areas around the median line show the interquartile and interdecile ranges of the data. Sea Ice Index data.
Figure 2b. This plot shows the departure from average air temperature in the Arctic at the 925 hPa level, in degrees Celsius, for March 2021. Yellows and reds indicate higher than average temperatures; blues and purples indicate lower than average temperatures.
During March, sea ice extent tracked well below average, but as noted in our previous post, the seasonal maximum in extent, reached on March 21, one day after the vernal equinox, was only the seventh lowest in the passive microwave satellite record. Since ice extent in March increases through the first part of the month and then decreases thereafter, the daily average growth rate is not a very meaningful statistic.
Air temperatures at the 925 mb level (about 2,500 feet above sea level) in March were up to 5 degrees Celsius (9 degrees Fahrenheit) below average across northern Eurasia and extending east over Alaska. Temperatures were 1 to 3 degrees Celsius (2 to 5 degrees) Celsius above average over the Atlantic side of the Arctic, with a tongue of above-average temperatures extending into the Beaufort Sea (Figure 2b). The associated atmospheric circulation for March features low pressure over the northern North Atlantic, with the lowest pressure focused over the Barents Sea (Figure 2c). After remaining in a fairly persistent negative phase for much of the past winter, the Arctic Oscillation index in March was mostly positive, but with large fluctuations.
March 2021 compared to previous years
Figure 3. Monthly March ice extent for 1979 to 2021 shows a decline of 2.6 percent per decade.
Through 2021, the linear rate of decline for March sea ice extent, relative to the 1981 to 2010 average extent, is 2.6 percent per decade, which corresponds to 39,700 square kilometers (15,300 square miles) per year, about the size of the US states of Maryland and Delaware combined or the country of Switzerland. The cumulative March ice loss over the 43-year satellite record is 1.67 million square kilometers (645,000 square miles), based on the difference in linear trend values in 2021 and 1979, which is equivalent in size to the state of Alaska.
Troubles in the Gulf of St. Lawrence
Figure 4. A harp seal pup rests on sea ice. Harp seal pups are born with long white fur that helps them absorb sunlight and stay warm while they develop blubber. Pups shed their white fur after about three to four weeks old.
This winter ice extent was far below average in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, which is an outlet for the US Great Lakes located northeast of New Brunswick. The unusually low sea ice extent is leading to the death of many harp seal pups. In December, harp seals arrive at the Gulf of St. Lawrence from the Canadian Arctic and Greenland, and then give birth to pups under snow on the ice cover. With so little sea ice, many pups were forced to cluster on shore where they are vulnerable to predators, leading to high pup mortality. It is widely viewed that with continued warming and loss of sea ice, harp seal populations will decline.
Antarctic sea ice on the rise
Figure 5. Antarctic sea ice extent for March 2021 was 4.45 million square kilometers (1.72 million square miles). The magenta line shows the 1981 to 2010 average extent for that month. Sea Ice Index data. About the data
After reaching its seasonal minimum extent on February 21, Antarctic sea ice extent climbed rapidly, passing the long-term average daily extent on March 1. The rate of growth was very rapid between February 25 and March 8, expanding by over one million square kilometers (386,000 square miles) in the 12-day period. This is the fastest expansion in the four-decade record of sea ice extent for this time of year, and was caused by a rapid refreezing of the western Amundsen Sea and eastern Ross Sea areas. Since early March, growth has slowed to a more typical, slightly below-average pace. The Amundsen and eastern Ross Seas remain well above the average extent for the season. Sea ice extent in the Bellingshausen Sea and Weddell Sea are slightly below average. At the end of the month, Antarctic ice extent neared 5.5 million square kilometers (2.1 million square miles).",,,Analysis,,2021-04-06,Sea ice data updated daily with one-day lag

What You Need to Know
What to Expect
The Arctic encompasses several countries and cultures. You can learn about Inuit customs in Nunavut, Canada’s newest territory, or also explore the Indigenous cultures of Greenland. Then there’s the outpost of Longyearbyen in Spitsbergen, the capital of the Svalbard archipelago. Visitors can have an entirely different experience in the remote lands within the Russian Arctic. Such diversity is part of the appeal of an Arctic expedition.
How to Get There
Speak to your Polar Travel Advisor who can explain where your voyage will embark and provide information on the nearest airport. Transfer flights are sometimes included in your package and are arranged by Quark Expeditions. Some embarkations require passengers to book flights at preferred times. Speak to your polar travel advisor.
Visas & Passports
Always travel with a passport that’s valid for at least six months. Some Arctic expeditions may require a visa in addition to your passport, depending on your nationality and the country you’re visiting. Remember that some of our expeditions visit multiple countries. Speak to one of our experienced Polar Travel Advisors, who can outline the travel documents required for your chosen expedition, or contact your local consulate or embassy.
Arctic Destinations
The Canadian High Arctic includes lands in the Northwest Territories, Yukon and Nunavut. There are more than 35,563 islands in the remote Canadian Arctic Archipelago, which includes Baffin Island and Ellesmere Island. The mountains, glaciers, tundra, remote rocky shorelines, granite cliffs and Arctic waters are home to polar bears, grizzly bears, muskoxen, beluga whales, harp seals, walruses and migratory birds, among other wildlife species.
The best of Greenland can be found along its coastline, which is dominated by icebergs, glaciers, deep fjords, mountains and vast stretches of wilderness. Greenland’s traditional Inuit communities (descendants of the Thule people) appeal to travelers with a passion for ancient cultures. For nature-lovers, Greenland offers unrivalled wildlife-viewing: polar bears, muskoxen, humpback whales, walruses, sea eagles and reindeer. And of course, there’s the Aurora Borealis, commonly known as the Northern Lights.
The chance to stand at the very top of the world lures travelers to the North Pole, which is often called “terra incognita,” the unknown land. No one lives on this constantly shifting ice domain in the middle of the Arctic Ocean at 90° North. The closest permanently inhabited settlement is Alert, Nunavut, about 800 kilometres (508 miles) away. There’s an otherworldly quality to the North Pole—where every direction you look is south.
Russia’s Arctic territory, most of which has no permanent human population, includes 24,140 kilometres of coastline along the Arctic Ocean, the Barents Sea, Bering Sea and the Sea of Okhotsk. Various Arctic archipelagoes, such as Novaya Zemlya and Severnaya Zemlya, make up much of the Russian Arctic. Russia’s remote, seldom-visited Franz Josef Land, 950 kilometres from the North Pole, attracts polar adventurers, as well.
Spitsbergen is the largest island in the Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard, and is often called “The land of the midnight sun.” The island is also known as “The Wildlife Capital of the Arctic.” Polar bears, walruses, reindeers, arctic foxes, beluga whales, seals and seabirds are found amongst the icebergs, glaciers and snow-covered mountains.

The North Pole is in the middle of the Arctic Ocean which is surrounded by the land masses of North America, Europe and Asia so there is a land connection to the south meaning that land animals can more easily reach the Arctic unlike Antarctica where animals must be able to swim or fly across hundreds of miles of frigid and storm-prone ocean even at the narrowest point.

An analysis of satellite data by NASA and the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) at the University of Colorado Boulder shows that the 2020 minimum extent, which was likely reached on Sept. 15, measured 1.44 million square miles (3.74 million square kilometers).
In winter, frozen seawater covers almost the entire Arctic Ocean and neighboring seas. This sea ice undergoes seasonal patterns of change – thinning and shrinking during late spring and summer, and thickening and expanding during fall and winter. The extent of summer sea ice in the Arctic can impact local ecosystems, regional and global weather patterns, and ocean circulation. In the last two decades, the minimum extent of Arctic sea ice in the summer has dropped markedly. The lowest extent on record was set in 2012, and last year’s extent was tied for second – until this year’s.
A Siberian heat wave in spring 2020 began this year’s Arctic sea ice melt season early, and with Arctic temperatures being 14 to 18 degrees Fahrenheit (8 to 10 degrees Celsius) warmer than average, the ice extent kept declining. The 2020 minimum extent was 958,000 square miles (2.48 million square kilometers) below the 1981-2010 average of yearly minimum extents, and 2020 is only the second time on record that the minimum extent has fallen below 1.5 million square miles (4 million square kilometers).

“It was just really warm in the Arctic this year, and the melt seasons have been starting earlier and earlier,” said Nathan Kurtz, a sea ice scientist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. “The earlier the melt season starts, the more ice you generally lose.”
Thin ice also melts quicker than thicker floes. Dramatic drops in sea ice extent in 2007 and 2012, along with generally declining summer extent, has led to fewer regions of thick, multi-year ice that has built up over multiple winters. In addition, a recent study showed that warmer water from the Atlantic Ocean, which is typically deep below the colder Arctic waters, is creeping up closer to the bottom of the sea ice and warming it from below.
There are cascading effects in the Arctic, said Mark Serreze, director of NSIDC. Warmer ocean temperatures eat away at the thicker multiyear ice, and also result in thinner ice to start the spring melt season. Melt early in the season results in more open water, which absorbs heat from the Sun and increases water temperatures.
“As the sea ice cover extent declines, what we’re seeing is we’re continuing to lose that multiyear ice,” Serreze said. “The ice is shrinking in the summer, but it’s also getting thinner. You’re losing extent, and you’re losing the thick ice as well. It’s a double whammy.”
The second lowest extent of sea ice on record is just one of many signs of a warming climate in the north, he said, pointing to the Siberian heat waves, forest fires, hotter-than-average temperatures over the Central Arctic, and the thawing permafrost that led to a Russian fuel spill.

Scientists and designers are proposing radical ways to 'refreeze' the Arctic
If planting more trees can replenish forests and remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, then could we also repopulate the Arctic with ice?
That's a question posed by a team of Indonesian designers with an eye-catching response to the climate crisis: iceberg-making submarines.
The idea, recently named runner-up in an international design competition appealing for radical approaches to sustainability, is the latest in a series of new proposals for ""refreezing"" the Earth's poles -- from sprinkling them with artificial sand to blasting seawater into the sky to brighten the clouds.
Led by 29-year-old architect Faris Rajak Kotahatuhaha, the group envisaged a submersible vessel capable of producing 16-foot-thick, 82-foot wide hexagonal icebergs.
The process would begin with the submarine dipping beneath the surface to fill its central cavity with seawater. Salt would then be filtered out, raising water's freezing point by more than 3 degrees Fahrenheit, after which a hatch closes over the chamber to protect it from the sun.
An iceberg would then form naturally inside, before being ejected a month later. According to the team behind the project, the hexagonal shape may encourage the icebergs (or ""ice babies"" as Kotahatuhaha refers to them) to interlock with one another and form larger frozen masses.
It's an early concept design, and many questions remain. The designers are yet to finalize how the vehicle would be powered, though they intend for the vessel to be fully sustainable. But could the submarines, in theory, work?
Andrew Shepherd, a professor of Earth observation at the UK's Leeds University, described the idea as an ""interesting engineering solution,"" though he questioned the project's scalability. He estimated that replacing polar ice at the same rate it has disappeared in the last four decades would require around 10 million submarines.
""That's a lot of machines,"" Shepherd said in an email. ""For context, that's not far off the total number of Model-T Fords built in all time.""
But for Kotahatuhaha, the proposal is not only about feasibility -- it's about finding a different way to approach climate challenges.
""The Arctic has lost ice from year to year in the last decade,"" he said on the phone from Jakarta. ""So we tried to solve the problem through a different way of thinking.
""Richer countries have millions to spend on (sea walls and) protection, but what about poor countries with no budget for (defending against) rising sea levels? This is a problem the world now faces together. We have a different approach: Rather than defending against sea level rises, we think it's better (to carry out) some kind of intervention to tackle the problem.""
Protecting the poles
A possible flaw in the proposal -- and others like it -- is that making ice does not significantly alter sea levels. If the ice is still floating in the water it formed from, then sea's overall mass doesn't change. (The icebergs would have to be ""moved on to land"" if they were to lower sea levels, Shepherd said).
But reversing, or at least slowing, the alarming decline of polar sea ice is about more than rising oceans. Snow and ice reflect significantly more sunlight than open water does, so bigger, frozen surfaces mean more radiation is sent back to space.
""If enough (ice) is made, then it could ultimately alter the planet's temperature, which could in turn lead to reduced land ice melting and reduced sea level rise from that source,"" Shepherd said, offering an alternative advantage to making icebergs. ""But there are lots of 'ifs' along the way.""
Farfetched as it may sound, the idea of re-freezing the poles through geoengineering is being explored elsewhere in academia. In 2017, a team of researchers at Arizona State University revealed a concept for a wind-powered pump that sucks up seawater and sprays it out onto the ice's surface, where it will freeze faster.
The scientists' research suggested that using 10 million of the devices could add a meter (3.2 feet) onto the surface of a polar ice sheet over the course of a winter.
Other proposals have focused on protecting ice rather than creating it.
Since 1990, British physicist John Lanham has explored a technique known as marine cloud brightening, in which particles -- such as the salt in seawater -- are injected into clouds to increase the amount of sunlight they reflect. Together with Stephen Salter, a professor of engineering design at the University of Edinburgh, Lanham developed a concept design for a floating ""spray vessel"" which could fire seawater into the clouds via a series of masts.
Brighter clouds could mean that less sunlight reaching the Earth's surface, thus reducing summer melting and encouraging the replenishment of ice during the winter.
Elsewhere, the US non-profit group Ice911 has spent the last decade developing a highly reflective sand-like material that can be scattered on ice to protect it from the sun's rays.
Last year, the group tested its ""hollow microspheres,"" which are made from silicate glass, over 15,000 square meters (3.7 acres) of frozen lake in Alaska. Researchers found that treated ice was thicker and more reflective than untreated ice.
Detractors say that plans to refreeze the Arctic address the symptom, not the cause. Indeed, even if proposals did prove feasible, none would combat the carbon consumption responsible for diminishing sea ice in the first place.
As Julienne Stroeve, a professor at University College London and senior scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center, told CNN when the Arizona State University's team first proposed its wind-powered pump concept: ""Global warming in response to rising CO2 concentrations would continue despite efforts to grow ice in the Arctic. Thus, the excess heat at lower latitudes would still be transported towards the Arctic via atmospheric and oceanic circulation and this would counter efforts to grow ice in the Arctic.""
But for Kotahatuhaha and his team, big problems require bold innovation. While he accepts that his iceberg-making submarines are a ""utopian project,"" he wants experts from different fields to help build radical visions into viable solutions.
""Architects cannot build skyscrapers alone,"" he offered as an analogy. ""(They) need collaboration from civil engineers, electrical engineers, economists and others.
""If there are too many limitations, there will be no innovation,"" he added. ""Innovation is the first step to opening (our) way of thinking, then technology and research regarding ... feasibility must be deepened.""",,"Oscar Holland, CNN",,,2019-09-02,CNN

Arctic vegetation has adapted to the cold climates of the north. However, ongoing climate change, amplified across the Arctic, threatens to perturb this fine equilibrium, leading to shifts in vegetation species, abundance and distribution.
Arctic warming and permafrost thaw drive changes in ground stability, soil drainage capacity and expose previously frozen and unreachable pools of soil organic carbon and soil mineral constituents, which potentially become available for living organisms (plants and soil microbial communities). Moreover, seasonal changes in climate are resulting in earlier snowmelt and spring thaw. Together, these changing conditions set the scene for longer and warmer growing seasons, and generate higher plant productivity. Besides the global “arctic greening” phenomenon, the intimate relationship between vegetation and surrounding landscapes leads to contrasted shifts in vegetation across the Arctic region.
Arctic tundra and permafrost degradation: Vegetation shift to sedge or shrub dominance?
The typical Arctic tundra has patchy and low ground vegetation consisting of vascular species such as sedges, forbs, and shrubs, but also non-vascular species with carpets of mosses and lichens. With the current increase in height and biomass of the Arctic vegetation, two major shifts in vegetation are observed. Studies highlight either a sedge dominance relative to other species or a shrubification, i.e., an intensification of deciduous and evergreen shrub production rates. The occurrence of one scenario or the other depends on the plant group strategy to compete under a soil evolution towards wetter or drier conditions (see the picture above). Ultimately, these contrasted changes in vegetation have different feedback implications on the environment.
Changes in Arctic tundra vegetation: What consequences for the environment?
Increased plant productivity and sustained biomass production may slow down the permafrost carbon feedback by enhancing atmospheric carbon dioxide consumption via photosynthesis. Alternatively, expanding plant cover in permafrost regions reduces the highly reflective snow cover and may thereby amplify global warming. Moreover, sedge-dominated and woody shrub-dominated tundra show differences in snow interception, directly affecting the snow cover thickness and its insulating effect on the ground.
Impact of vegetation changes on the cycling of mineral nutrients
Plant leaves are the key connectors between soil and plants because of their storage capacity and seasonal cycling upon leaf fall. Plants take up mineral nutrients from the soil to sustain vital functions, to grow and to develop. Nevertheless, species have different functional traits and differ in their morphological, biochemical, physiological, and phenological characteristics. Sedges and shrubs rely on distinct uptake strategies and accumulate mineral elements in different concentrations and distribution into their tissues. For example, sedge shoots are enriched in silicon (Si), potassium (K), iron (Fe), aluminium (Al), and phosphorus (P), whereas shrub foliar tissues are more concentrated in calcium (Ca) and manganese (Mn).
All of these elements, essential mineral nutrients for plant development (e.g., Ca, K, Fe or Mn) or not (e.g., Si and Al), contribute to plant mineral composition and are therefore connected to soil composition. As part of the WeThaw project, Elisabeth Mauclet investigates if changes in vegetation composition, and thereby changes in the mineral element foliar storage, affect the biological and geochemical cycles and turnover of these mineral elements across the Arctic tundra. Understanding the impact of changing Arctic tundra vegetation on the mineral element cycling is key to generating integrated predictions of the ecosystem functioning based on scenarios of the Arctic evolution and the associated feedback on climate change.
Implications for some key elements
Shifts in vegetation may lead to changes in mineral element transfer from plant leaves to the soil surface. This potentially intensified transfer of mineral elements may directly affect local biogeochemical processes. For example, if the organic form of phosphorus is returned to the soil, it may be rapidly mineralised and be available again for plant uptake upon intensified microbial activity in warmer conditions. Amplified recycling of a limiting nutrient such as phosphorus would potentially increase plant production, and contribute to carbon sequestration into plant tissues. Conversely, manganese is an element that may enhance organic matter decomposition upon specific redox conditions and, in turn, amplify the release of carbon to the atmosphere.
The WeThaw project is bridging the knowledge gap between Arctic vegetation evolution and the species mineral element composition. The research project contributes to improve our understanding of the mineral element transfer from plant tissues to soil, given the implications for the biogeochemical cycling of the elements and the influence on the carbon balance in the Arctic.

Still, the Arctic is home to more than 21,000 species: mammals, birds, fish, invertebrates, plants and fungi (Arctic Biodiversity Assessment 2013: Species Diversity in the Arctic).
Arctic animals and plants have adapted to cold and dark in many ways. The species of animals that live all year round in the north are characterised by a thick coat of fur or feather that keeps them warm in frost and wind. The animals store fat before winter and use the snow cover as a protection against the cold.
Adaptation to changing conditions is facilitated by factors related to the activities and characteristics of the animals, such as changes in colour and metabolism. Some animals hibernate during the winter to survive the long winter. Migratory birds, for their part, prefer the Arctic in the summer, when there is plenty of food and sunlight.
During the short growing season, the plants make effective use of the rays of the sun, for example, with their low structure and cup-like flowers. Wax or hair on stems, leaves and buds protect the plants from wind and cold.

The region surrounding the North Pole consists of a large ocean surrounded by land. This ocean, called the Arctic Ocean, is like no other ocean on Earth; and because of its special location and climate, the lands that surround it are unique.
Most commonly, scientists define the Arctic as the region above the Arctic Circle, an imaginary line that circles the globe at approximately 66° 34' N (dashed blue circle in the map at right). The Arctic Circle marks the latitude above which the sun does not set on the summer solstice, and does not rise on the winter solstice. At the North Pole, the sun rises once each year and sets once each year: there are six months of continuous daylight and six months of continuous night. At lower latitudes, but north of the Arctic Circle, the duration of continuous day and night are shorter.
But other people use different definitions when talking about the Arctic. Some scientists define the Arctic as the area north of the arctic tree line (green line in map at right), where the landscape is frozen and dotted with shrubs and lichens.

Extreme warm air temperatures in the Eurasian Arctic illustrate significant region-wide effects of year-to-year variability and connections across the Arctic environment.
Highlights
- The average annual land surface air temperature north of 60° N for October 2019-September 2020 was the second highest on record since at least 1900. Record warm temperatures in the Eurasian Arctic were associated with extreme conditions in the ocean and on the land.
In the oceans
- Sea ice loss in spring 2020 was particularly early in the East Siberian Sea and Laptev Sea regions, setting new record lows in the Laptev Sea for June. The end of summer sea ice extent in 2020 was the second lowest in the 42-year satellite record, with 2012 being the record minimum year.
- August mean sea surface temperatures in 2020 were ~1-3°C warmer than the 1982-2010 August mean over most of the Arctic Ocean, with exceptionally warm temperatures in the Laptev and Kara seas that coincided with the early loss of sea ice in this region.
- During July and August 2020, regional ocean primary productivity in the Laptev Sea was ~2 times higher for July and ~6 times higher for August compared to their respective monthly averages.
- Bowhead whales have been a staple resource for coastal Indigenous peoples for millennia and are uniquely adapted for the arctic marine ecosystem. The Pacific Arctic population size has increased in the past 30 years likely due to increases in ocean primary production and northward transport of the zooplankton they feed on.
- Shifts in air temperatures, storminess, sea ice and ocean conditions have combined to increase coastal permafrost erosion rates, in regions where a high proportion of Arctic residents live and industrial, commercial, tourist and military activities are expanding.
On the land
- The exceptional warm spring air temperatures across Siberia resulted in record low June snow cover extent across the Eurasian Arctic, as observed in the past 54 years.
- Extreme wildfires in 2020 in the Sakha Republic of northern Russia coincided with unparalleled warm air temperatures and record snow loss in the region.
- Since 2016, tundra greenness trends have diverged strongly by continent, declining sharply in North America but remaining above the long-term average in Eurasia.
- From September 2019 to August 2020, the Greenland Ice Sheet experienced higher ice loss than the 1981-2010 average but substantially lower than the record 2018/19 loss.
- Glaciers and ice sheets outside of Greenland have continued a trend of significant ice loss, dominated largely by ice loss from Alaska and Arctic Canada.
Observing Arctic change
- Advancements in the integration of models and observations have increased the skill and utility of Arctic sea ice predictions on seasonal to decadal to century timescales.
- Important additions to the Arctic Observing Network (AON) systems and data products and advancements in process-level understanding have improved the quality and accessibility of information used to produce the Arctic Report Card.
- The unique Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate (MOSAiC) project concluded a historic, international, yearlong expedition into the Arctic ice pack in September 2020, collecting a legacy dataset that aims to advance the understanding, modeling and predicting of Arctic environmental change.
- Opening of the new NOAA Barrow Observatory, near Utqiaġvik, Alaska, enables the continuation of nearly half a century of atmosphere and terrestrial in situ observations.",,Tracey Nakamura,,,2020-10-01,Arctic Program

Established by the Ottawa Declaration in 1996, the Arctic Council is the preeminent intergovernmental forum for addressing issues related to the Arctic Region. The members of the Arctic Council include the eight Arctic States (Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, the Russian Federation, and the United States). The Arctic Council is not a treaty-based international organization but rather an international forum that operates on the basis of consensus, echoing the peaceful and cooperative nature of the Arctic Region. The Council focuses its work on matters related to sustainable development, the environmental protection; its mandate explicitly excludes military security. Traditionally, the Council is chaired by the foreign minister of the country holding the chairmanship. Its day-to-day work is carried out by the eight Senior Arctic Officials (SAO) and six PP representatives, with input from working groups, expert groups, and task forces. To learn more about the Arctic Council, please visit their website at: www.arctic-council.org .
The United States held the rotating chairmanship of the Arctic Council from 1998-2000 and 2015-2017. More information on the 2015-2017 U.S. Chairmanship and 10th Ministerial Meeting can be found here.
Arctic Science Agreement (2017)
In May 2017, the eight Arctic States signed the Agreement on Enhancing International Arctic Scientific Cooperation during the 10th Arctic Council Ministerial in Fairbanks, Alaska. This is the third legally binding agreement negotiated under the auspices of the Arctic Council. The agreement facilitates access by scientists of the eight Arctic States to Arctic areas that each State has identified, including entry and exit of persons, equipment, and materials; access to research infrastructure and facilities; and access to research areas. The agreement also calls for the parties to promote education and training of scientists working on Arctic matters.
The geographic area, as defined by the Arctic Research and Policy Act of 1984 , covered by this agreement in the United States includes territory north of the Arctic Circle and north and west of the boundary formed by the Porcupine, Yukon, and Kuskokwim Rivers; the Aleutian chain; and adjacent marine areas in the Arctic Ocean and the Beaufort, Bering, and Chukchi Seas.
The point of contact for this agreement for the United States is the U.S. Arctic Research Commission , which can be reached at (703) 525-0113 or info@arctic.gov.
Arctic Marine Oil Pollution Preparedness and Response Agreement (2013)
In May 2013, the eight Arctic States signed the Agreement on Cooperation on Marine Oil Pollution Preparedness and Response in the Arctic during the 9th Arctic Council Ministerial in Kiruna, Sweden. This is the second legally binding agreement negotiated under the auspices of the Arctic Council. The agreement strengthens cooperation, coordination, and mutual assistance among Arctic nations on oil pollution preparedness and response in the region to protect the marine environment. The agreement is helping to forge strong partnerships in advance of an oil spill so that Arctic countries can quickly and cooperatively respond before it endangers lives and threatens fragile ecosystems.
Arctic Search and Rescue (SAR) Agreement (2011)
In May 2011, the eight Arctic States signed the Agreement on Cooperation on Aeronautical and Maritime Search and Rescue in the Arctic during the 8th Arctic Council Ministerial in Nuuk, Greenland (Denmark). This is the first legally binding agreement negotiated under the auspices of the Arctic Council. It coordinates life-saving international maritime and aeronautical SAR coverage and response among the Arctic States across an area of about 13 million square miles in the Arctic. The SAR Agreement will improve search and rescue response in the Arctic by committing all Parties to coordinate appropriate assistance to those in distress and to cooperate with each other in undertaking SAR operations. For each Party, the Agreement defines an area of the Arctic in which it will have lead responsibility in organizing responses to SAR incidents, both large and small. Parties to the Agreement commit to provide SAR assistance regardless of the nationality or status of persons who may need it.

Foreword from the minister
The Arctic and Northern Policy Framework is a profound change of direction for the Government of Canada. For too long, Canada's Arctic and northern residents, especially Indigenous people, have not had access to the same services, opportunities, and standards of living as those enjoyed by other Canadians. There are longstanding inequalities in transportation, energy, communications, employment, community infrastructure, health and education. While almost all past governments have put forward northern strategies, none closed these gaps for the people of the North, or created a lasting legacy of sustainable economic development.
In her 2016 Interim Report on the Shared Arctic Leadership Model, Minister's Special Representative Mary Simon said, ""the simple fact is that Arctic strategies throughout my lifetime have rarely matched or addressed the magnitude of the basic gaps between what exists in the Arctic and what other Canadians take for granted.""
Co-developing the new framework became a bold opportunity to shape and direct change in the region by collaborating with governments, northerners and Indigenous governments and organizations. Consultation was not enough to meet the challenges and harness emerging opportunities in the Arctic and North. In a significant shift, the federal government, Indigenous peoples, Inuit, First Nations and Métis, 6 territorial and provincial governments (Yukon, Northwest Territories, Nunavut, Newfoundland and Labrador, Quebec, and Manitoba) contributed to this framework together.
A shared vision
Today, there is a shared vision of the future where northern and Arctic people are thriving, strong and safe. The Arctic and Northern Policy Framework gives us a roadmap to achieve this vision. There are clear priorities and actions set out by the federal government and its partners to:
- nurture healthy families and communities
- invest in the energy, transportation and communications infrastructure that northern and Arctic governments, economies and communities need
- create jobs, foster innovation and grow Arctic and northern economies
- support science, knowledge and research that is meaningful for communities and for decision-making
- face the effects of climate change and support healthy ecosystems in the Arctic and North
- ensure that Canada and our northern and Arctic residents are safe, secure and well-defended
- restore Canada's place as an international Arctic leader
- advance reconciliation and improve relationships between Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples
For the federal government, the framework's goals will guide investments and activities, through 2030. Implementing the Arctic and Northern Policy Framework will require collaborative approaches. Our government recognizes that 'made in Ottawa' policies have not been successful. The new approach puts the future into the hands of the people who live there to realize the promise of the Arctic and the North. Through the co-development of the framework, and by working in partnership to realize its vision and implement its goals and objectives, this initiative will advance reconciliation and renew Canada's relationship with Inuit, First Nations, Métis and support the non-Indigenous residents of Canada's Arctic and North.
A crucial element of this innovative, cooperative form of policy making is the inclusion of chapters from our Indigenous, territorial and provincial partners. Through these chapters, our partners speak directly to Canadians and to the world, expressing their own visions, aspirations and priorities. These critical components of the Arctic and Northern Policy Framework map out areas of present and future collaboration between partners and the Government of Canada, and will provide guidance on the implementation of the framework.
In reflecting their priorities and aspirations, these chapters recognize and advance the vision and interests of Inuit, First Nations and Métis peoples. Partners have chosen their own approaches to crafting these chapters. For example, Yukon First Nations and the Government of Yukon have collaborated closely during the development of the Arctic and Northern Policy Framework, and will be producing separate chapters that speak to their mutual as well as distinct interests. First Nations and Métis worked with the Government of the Northwest Territories to draft the Northwest Territories chapter of the framework.
Inuit Nunangat is the Inuit homeland in Canada. Inuit are the majority population in this distinct geographic, cultural, and political region. In order to respect and support Inuit self-determination, an Inuit Nunangat chapter was developed as an Inuit-Crown Partnership Committee deliverable. This chapter will guide how Arctic and Northern Policy Framework goals and objectives are implemented in Inuit Nunangat. This will ensure that the framework respects Inuit rights and that an Inuit Nunangat approach is utilized in the development and implementation of federal policies and programs that are intended to benefit Inuit, creating efficiencies that in turn benefit all Canadians.
Territorial governments have authored chapters setting out their priorities for new investments and approaches in areas such as economic development, infrastructure and post-secondary education. Yukon, Northwest Territories and Nunavut are also contributing a pan-territorial chapter that articulates their common challenges and opportunities. Drawing on the 2017 Pan-Territorial Vision for Sustainable Development, the territorial governments offer their vision for how the Arctic and Northern Policy Framework can support strong and healthy communities, based on a foundation of responsible resource development, economic diversification, infrastructure and innovation.
The next phase of framework co-development will focus on implementation, investment strategies and governance, moving towards more integrated federal-territorial-provincial and Indigenous approaches to challenges and opportunities in Canada's Arctic and North. Partner chapters will be integral to this next step towards improving the quality of life for our Arctic and Northern residents, especially for Indigenous peoples.
On the front lines of climate change…
The Canadian North is warming at about 3 times the global average rate, which is affecting the land, biodiversity, cultures and traditions.Footnote 1 At the same time, climate change and technology are making the Arctic more accessible.
The region has become an important crossroad where issues of climate change, international trade and global security meet. As melting sea ice opens shipping routes, it is also putting the rich wealth of northern natural resources within reach. Increased commercial and tourism interests also bring increased safety and security challenges that include search and rescue and human-created disasters.
By forging new partnerships, the framework will help address the massive implications of climate change for individuals, communities, businesses and governments alike, and ensure a more sustainable future for northerners.
…and a changing world
Unlike previous Arctic and northern policies, the framework better aligns Canada's current national and international policy objectives with the priorities of Indigenous peoples and of northerners. As the region undergoes rapid environmental change and international interest surges, Canada must demonstrate renewed Arctic leadership.
The Government of Canada will continue to support the co-operative, rules-based international order that has served national and global interests by fostering peace, security and stability for the circumpolar Arctic. Canada will also continue to ensure that the Canadian Arctic and North and its people are safe, secure and well defended. As part of achieving this goal, Canada has committed to increasing Search and Rescue reaction and responsiveness to emergencies for Arctic residents and visitors.
What have we done so far?
The framework and its chapters provide a foundation for future cooperation between the Government of Canada and its Arctic and Northern partners.
The time has arrived to put the goals and objectives into action. The Government of Canada has already begun to realize the framework's vision of thriving, strong and safe communities, and made progress on the priorities identified in the chapters developed by Indigenous, territorial and provincial partners. The following provides just some examples of Canada's commitment to responding to the priorities of partners and the needs and aspirations of our Arctic and Northern residents.
Investments to support better, more relevant and accessible education have been identified in the Inuit Nunangat and Northwest Territories chapters and by Yukon Government. The 2019 federal budget included:
- funding for a task force to study post-secondary education, which will make recommendations on a robust system of higher education in the Arctic and North
- support for culturally-appropriate and community-developed courses for Indigenous and non-Indigenous northern students through the Dechinta Centre for Research and Learning
- an Inuit-led post-secondary education strategy
As well, a new science building at Yukon College will be built to support the goal of transforming this institution into Canada's first university in the North.
To build stronger communities, there is funding for community-led food production projects and skills training for local and Indigenous food production systems. Recent federal investments and policy development undertaken in cooperation with Indigenous peoples will help strengthen food security in Arctic and northern communities and reinforce Indigenous connections with wildlife and the land, as called for in the Inuit Nunangat chapter. The Government of Canada has recently invested $62.6 million over 5 years starting in fiscal year 2019 to 2020, with $10.4 million ongoing to support changes to the Nutrition North program, including a Harvesters Support Grant to help lower the high costs associated with traditional hunting and harvesting activities, which are an important source of healthy, traditional food. Canada and Inuit have also established an Inuit-Crown Food Security working group to focus on food security and work towards a sustainable food system in Inuit Nunangat.
As stated in the Northwest Territories chapter, growing a diversified and sustainable economy is vital to cushioning the northern economy from boom and bust cycles. The federal Jobs and Tourism Initiative will support cultural exchange and expand trade opportunities, while the new Inclusive Diversification and Economic Advancement in the North initiative will provide funds for a wider range of infrastructure such as roads and visitors centres.
Funding has been allocated for scientific research in the North, including for advancing Canada's claim to its continental shelf in both the Arctic and Atlantic oceans, for the Polar Continental Shelf Program, and for the Eureka Weather Station on Ellesmere Island. In its chapter, the Northwest Territories identifies the achieving of major advances in the remediation of reclamation sites following resource development as an environmental priority; cleaning up old mine sites of debris and toxic materials will be funded under the Northern Abandoned Mine Reclamation Program.
New transportation infrastructure funding has been identified by all partner chapters as crucial to improving safety and fostering economic and social development. Canada is investing $71.7 million in federal funding through Canada's National Trade Corridors Fund for four Nunavut transportation projects, including preparatory work on the Grays Bay Road and Port Project and an expansion of the Rankin Inlet airport terminal building capacity. Funding for priority action items identified in the Northwest Territories chapter was included in the 2019 federal budget investments in support of the eventual framework. For example, planning for the proposed Taltson hydroelectricity expansion project in the Northwest Territories, identified as a priority infrastructure project, is funded starting in 2019. There is also a commitment for long-awaited, universal high-speed internet in remote and northern communities. Delivering high-speed internet to these communities will help businesses grow, create new jobs and connect people to the resources, services and information they need to build a better future. It is a key step to closing the gap in the quality of life experienced by Arctic and northern residents and other Canadians. As part of its commitment to support new protection for the High Arctic and create opportunities for Inuit, the Government of Canada is providing infrastructure investments totaling over $190 million to build multi-use buildings, food processing units and harbours.
Canada's international interests are supported through funding for the first Arctic Council-related permanent secretariat in Canada (for the Sustainable Development Working Group), increasing the participation of northerners in Arctic Council and Arctic research activities and providing northern youth with international learning opportunities.
The Inuit Nunangat chapter singles out mental health and closing gaps in social and economic well-being between Inuit and other Canadians as central to developing strong communities and advancing reconciliation. In partnership with Inuit organizations, Canada continues to invest towards this goal, including: new addictions treatment facilities in Nunavut and Nunavik with an emphasis on suicide prevention as well as significant new funding dedicated to health and social services for Inuit children.
Our future
The Arctic and Northern Policy Framework is ambitious and has just over 10 years to translate its goals and objectives into reality. In that time, the Government of Canada and its partners will close the gaps that exist between this region, particularly in relation to its Indigenous peoples, and the rest of the country.
Canada sees a future in which the people of the Arctic and North are full participants in Canadian society, with access to the same services, opportunities and standards of living as those enjoyed by other Canadians. This ambition will require greater effort, focus, trust and collaboration amongst partners.
Other circumpolar nations are making significant investments to make their Arctic regions part of the global community. Supporting Canadian initiatives to keep pace with international efforts will bring increased opportunities, health and well-being to Indigenous peoples and northerners.
Indigenous and Northern leaders have offered their best innovative, adaptive policy solutions that call for trust, inclusiveness and transparency. We can do no less than to respond with integrity, collaboration and openness. Building on these new partnerships, the Arctic and Northern Policy Framework provides a long-term foundation for transformative change, benefiting our Arctic, its Indigenous peoples, northern residents and all Canadians.

""The simple fact is that Arctic strategies throughout my lifetime have rarely matched or addressed the magnitude of the basic gaps between what exists in the Arctic and what other Canadians take for granted.""
— Mary Simon, Interim report on the Shared Arctic Leadership Model
Our vision
Strong, self-reliant people and communities working together for a vibrant, prosperous and sustainable Arctic and northern region at home and abroad, while expressing Canada's enduring Arctic sovereignty.
On December 20, 2016, the Government of Canada announced that a new Arctic Policy Framework would be co-developed in collaboration with Indigenous, territorial and provincial partners.Footnote 2
Canada recognizes that what has been done before has not succeeded in building a strong, sustainable region where most people share in the opportunities expected by most Canadians. Insufficient physical and social infrastructure has hindered opportunities for growth and prosperity in the region.
Doing what we have done before as a nation has not closed the gaps in well-being between Arctic and northern people and the rest of the country, so in trying to close those gaps, we have taken an approach that has not been tried before. Inspired by the consensus traditions of Arctic and northern Indigenous peoples, the federal government sought to engage representatives of territories, provinces, and Indigenous peoples as partners in the development of this policy framework. All have made considerable contributions. There is not unanimous agreement on all the issues, but robust and respectful discussion has shaped this document.
This federal framework is informed by extensive engagement, including:
- regional roundtables held in Arctic and northern communities
- interest-based roundtables
- a public submissions process
The voices of people who took part in these engagements are included here, as well as in the other integral parts of the framework which describe:
- Canada's international Arctic policy
- Canada's commitment to safety, security and defence in the region
- the distinctive needs and opportunities of:territoriesprovincesArctic and Northern Indigenous peoples of Canada
These sections provide further detail on priorities, aspirations, and potential actions to be implemented under the framework.
The Government of Canada committed to co-develop an ""Arctic Policy Framework"" with:
- Inuit
- First Nations
- Métis

- the governments of Manitoba, Quebec and Newfoundland and Labrador
The area covered by the word ""Arctic"" has many definitions. As we worked together on the policy framework, several partners, including First Nations in Yukon as well as First Nations and Métis in the Northwest Territories, expressed concerns that they did not feel included in the term ""Arctic."" Inuit also drew attention to the way in which terms can include and exclude. Often, strategies, policies, programming and investments targeted for the ""North"" have been directed towards the three territories and excluded Inuit. In response to these concerns, Canada's vision for the framework takes into account both the ""Arctic"" and ""Northern"" character of the region and those who live there; it is a policy framework for Canada's Arctic and North that includes the entirety of Inuit Nunangat — the Inuvialuit Settlement Region in the Northwest Territories, Labrador's Nunatsiavut region, the territory of Nunavik in Quebec, and Nunavut — the Inuit homeland in Canada.Footnote 3
In developing this framework, we have built on the extensive work already done by Indigenous, territorial and provincial partners. This includes the Pan-Territorial Vision for Sustainable Development, which is foundational to the framework.
The Pan-Territorial Vision, released by the territorial governments in 2017, reinforces the importance of resource development, economic diversification, improved infrastructure and innovation in building strong territorial economies and increasing self-reliance.
Other key policy initiatives that have contributed to the development of the framework include:
- strategies developed by Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami such as:National Inuit Suicide Prevention StrategyNational Inuit Strategy for Research
- the Parnasimautik Consultation Report produced by Nunavik Inuit
- the Government of Quebec's Plan Nord
- the work of the Look North steering committee appointed by the Government of Manitoba
""Every Northerner deserves the opportunity to experience wellness and the strength of community that characterizes Canadians. Economic development and diversification are foundational to this goal.""
— Pan-Territorial Vision for Sustainable Development
Our partners have helped us to understand and reflect the unique opportunities and challenges within the different regions, jurisdictional responsibilities and treaty rights across the Arctic and the North. The ongoing collaboration required to make this work is essential to the framework's successful implementation.
Together with the people and governments of the Arctic and the North, we will use domestic and international policies and investments to help realize the potential of the region and those who live there.
Another important contribution to this framework was made by Mary Simon, the Special Representative of the Minister of Indigenous and Northern Affairs, who advised the federal government on the most pressing issues facing the region. As Ms. Simon noted in her final report on shared Arctic leadership, there is a ""long history of visions, action plans, strategies and initiatives being devised 'for the North' and not 'with the North'."" This is why this framework has been co-developed for the North, in partnership with the North, to reflect the needs and priorities of the North.
""Nothing about us, without us"" is the essential principle that weaves federal, territorial, provincial and Indigenous institutions and interests together for mutual success. The Arctic and Northern Policy Framework is a response to change in the region. The framework represents an opportunity for Arctic and northern people, and their institutions, municipalities, organizations and governments, to come together with the federal government to shape and direct change toward better outcomes. Together, we can achieve our vision of strong, self-reliant people and communities working together for a vibrant, prosperous and sustainable Arctic and northern region at home and abroad, while expressing Canada's enduring Arctic sovereignty.
Our past
The Government of Canada is committed to building trust with our Arctic and northern partners.
To do so, we must first:
- begin to acknowledge the damaging aspects of our shared past
- face the challenges and opportunities of our shared present
- advance a vision of a shared, collaborative and brighter future
Prior to contact with non-Indigenous peoples, the first peoples had already developed sophisticated technologies, flourishing trading networks, and a rich and diverse array of innovative practices that allowed them to live well in difficult conditions.
The Inuit lived mostly on the coast, and developed innovative watercraft and hunting gear that enabled them to hunt game as large as bowhead whales. First Nations peoples tended to live inland, using both land and freshwater bodies; they developed watercraft suited to lakes and rivers and snowshoes that allowed them to use the land during long northern winters; and they followed the huge caribou herds that migrated between treeline and tundra.
Non-Indigenous people first came north in search of trade and trade routes, and in search of resources such as furs and gold. Most of the early contacts were brief, but over time the initial phase of first encounters and co-operation was followed by more prolonged and extensive contact, increasing numbers of newcomers, and eventually a period of profoundly damaging domination and colonization.
The impacts of colonialism in the Arctic and the North affected Indigenous peoples in many ways, including diseases, cultural assimilation including through residential schools, coerced relocation, and the drawing of international boundaries severing familial and cultural ties.
""There must be a system set up where the Indian people have some control over the programs that affect us. This control must not be just in the Administration of the program — but in the planning. If the idea behind the program is wrong, then we are wasting money, and people, trying to make it work.""
— Council for Yukon Indians, Together Today for Our Children Tomorrow, 1973
Modern self-determination in the region has evolved over the last 50 years and formalized with:
- the James Bay and Northern Quebec Agreement, concluded in 1975
- the Inuvialuit Final Agreement, signed in 1984
- the Umbrella Final Agreement for Yukon, finalized in 199011 of the 14 Yukon First Nations have now concluded agreements
- the Gwich'in comprehensive land claim, signed in 1992
- the Nunavut Agreement signed in 1993
- the Sahtu Dene signed in 1993
- the Métis Comprehensive Land Claim Agreement, signed in 1993
- the Tlicho Land Claims and Self-government agreement, signed in 2003
- the Labrador Inuit Land Claims agreement, signed in 2005
- the Nunavik Inuit Land Claim Agreement, signed in 2006
Many of these land claim agreements established innovative forms of co-management by Indigenous peoples and territorial, provincial and federal governments over land, water and other resources.
In addition to the land claim process and renewal of Indigenous self-government, the 20th and early 21st centuries have witnessed a strengthening of public governments in the Arctic and the North.
Territorial governments have become more democratic and attained increased responsibilities. Province-like powers over land and resources were devolved from the federal government to Yukon in 2003 and to the Northwest Territories in 2014. Negotiations with Nunavut over these powers and responsibilities are ongoing.
Each territory and province has developed unique ways to provide services to Indigenous residents and work with Indigenous governments.
- The Government of Yukon works in partnership with the territory's First Nations, including its 11 self-governing First Nations
- The Government of the Northwest Territories collaborates with Indigenous governments through its Intergovernmental Council and through a formalized commitment to Indigenous governments set out in Respect, Recognition, Responsibility: Government of the Northwest Territories' Approach to Engaging with Aboriginal Governments (2012).
- The Government of Nunavut works with regional Inuit associations through working partnerships to advance shared objectives, including provisions of the Nunavut Agreement.
- Drawing upon Indigenous traditions, the Northwest Territories and Nunavut government legislatures are based on a consensus decision-making system.
- The Government of Quebec works with:the Kativik Regional Government, established through the James Bay and Northern Quebec Agreement and elected by all the inhabitants of the Nunavik regionthe Makivik Corporation, also established by the James Bay and Northern Quebec Agreement, which represents the Inuit of Nunavik in their relations with the governments of Quebec and Canada on issues specifically pertaining to their Indigenous rights
At the forefront of this movement towards greater autonomy are the Indigenous peoples of the Circumpolar North. Their efforts to secure self-determination and self-government are influencing Arctic governance in ways that will have a profound impact on the region and its inhabitants in the years to come.
— Arctic Human Development Report (2015)
As an Arctic nation, Canada has long been interested in finding ways to cooperate with other Arctic and non-Arctic states on shared goals and challenges. In 1996 Canada played a key role in the Ottawa Declaration that created the Arctic Council, the pre-eminent forum for international cooperation in the Arctic on sustainable development and environmental protection. Canadian leadership also contributed to the Arctic Council taking the trail-blazing step of including Indigenous peoples' organizations at the Council table; 3 of which include Canadian membership.Footnote 4
Arctic Indigenous peoples have made remarkable contributions to international governance, both inside and outside the Arctic Council. For instance, the Inuit Circumpolar Council's highlighting impacts of global contaminants on Inuit helped mobilize support for the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants.
The legacy of colonization has left deep rifts in the region's social structure. Those rifts are being gradually healed, in part by the reclamation of self-determination. As highlighted in the Arctic Council's Arctic Human Development Reports, ""fate control"", or ""guiding one's own destiny"", is an important element in peoples' well-being. From the agreements already signed with Indigenous peoples, to those still being negotiated, and the devolution of powers to regional governments, the degree of fate control in the Arctic and the North is on the rise. Part of the challenge we currently face is to ensure that fate control comes with the capacity to meaningfully exercise local aspirations.
Our present
""Why, in spite of substantive progress over the past 40 years, including remarkable achievements such as land claims agreements, Constitutional inclusion and precedent-setting court rulings, does the (Canadian) Arctic continue to exhibit the worst national social indicators for basic wellness? Why, with all the hard-earned tools of empowerment, do many individuals and families not feel empowered and healthy?""
— Mary Simon, A New Shared Arctic Leadership Model
Longstanding inequalities in transportation, energy, communications, employment, community infrastructure, health and education continue to disadvantage people, especially Indigenous peoples, in Canada's Arctic and North. These gaps are evident in the socio-economic statistics and indicators for the region, and closing them is a priority for all partners.
A distinctive feature of the region is its high proportion of Indigenous people in the population. This includes Inuit, First Nations and Métis populations. The manner in which the Government of Canada interacts with Indigenous peoples continues to evolve.
The Principles Respecting the Government of Canada's Relationship with Indigenous Peoples affirm that ""The Government of Canada's approach to reconciliation is guided by the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's Calls to Action, constitutional values, and collaboration with Indigenous peoples as well as provincial and territorial governments."" Inuit and the federal government have developed the Inuit Nunangat Declaration and formed an Inuit-Crown Partnership Committee to jointly advance shared priorities. These include the implementation of Inuit land claims agreements, and the implementation of reconciliation measures between Inuit and the Government of Canada.
The federal government agrees with the people of the Arctic and the North that they must play a greater part in governing the region — domestically and internationally. In addition to land claim and self-government agreements, devolution agreements have been signed with the Northwest Territories and Yukon, transferring some authorities to their respective territorial governments, and another such agreement is being negotiated with Nunavut. Relationships that better recognize the rights and aspirations of people in the region have also been negotiated with sectors other than government. Benefit and partnership agreements with local communities have been developed in the resource sector, and successful partnerships have been established with researchers, and with non-governmental organizations.
The Arctic and North has what is described as a mixed economy: some people depend on traditional economies of hunting, fishing, and gathering, others depend on a wage economy, and some depend on both. The cultures and lifestyles of the peoples of the region provide them not only with subsistence and cultural continuity and strength, but also a bridge to the wage economy.
Despite the poor communications infrastructure in many communities, connectivity is increasingly important to the region.
- Students in Nunavut can connect to students throughout Inuit Nunungat
- A telehealth network links 14 Yukon communities
- Yellowknife's booming tourism industry is transformed by visitors' social media posts
- Telehealth is providing an opportunity to close gaps within the care provided to patients in Labrador
- Remote presence technology is allowing people on the northern coast of Labrador to receive some health-care services in their home communities
However, though there have been significant advances, many northern communities still have slow internet connections and no cell phone service, and priority within networks must be kept for vital services such as telehealth.
""…latent mineral potential of the north is perhaps still the single most likely source of long-term northern prosperity.""
— Look North Report and Action Plan for Manitoba's Northern Economy
Responsible, sustainable resource development and job creation are key to the economy of the region, and a source of prosperity for its communities and residents. Indigenous-owned businesses have for many years been providing resource industries with workers and services, and now Indigenous peoples are also moving into ownership positions in resource development businesses. Indigenous ownership, investment and participation in the resource industry are essential to the success of this sector and a means of economic reconciliation with Indigenous peoples.
Resource projects provide:
- education
- training and employment opportunities in communities
- direct Indigenous participation in supply and services business development
Looking to the future, there is no force likely to reshape the Arctic and the North greater than climate change. Globally, the region is amongst the most affected by climate change, which is redefining the environmental, social and economic landscape, both below the tree line and on the tundra. Arctic ecosystems are at a disproportionately high risk of experiencing the adverse effects of global warming.
The circumpolar Arctic is warming 2 to 3 times more rapidly than the global average, even though the region is not a leading source of greenhouse gas emissions.Footnote 5 According to Canada's Changing Climate Report, 2019, northern warming will continue for both low and high global greenhouse gas emission trajectories. The high scenario projects that annual average temperatures could increase 4 times as much as under the low scenario, and that events such as extreme precipitation could be 4 times as common.
Both scenarios would see accelerating loss of seasonal sea ice across Canada's Arctic, with extensive sea ice-free periods projected by mid-century for the Canadian Arctic and Hudson Bay, thawing permafrost causing irreversible changes to the landscape, a changed distribution of species, changing patterns of precipitation and more frequent wildfires.
Indigenous communities are particularly affected: traditional food sources are disappearing; ice conditions are becoming unpredictable and therefore dangerous for travel by hunters using either dogsled or snowmobile; and melting ice and rising sea levels are exposing communities to destructive coastal erosion and costly damage to infrastructure.
The greenhouse gases driving climate change are also making the water more acidic, which has been shown to have negative effects on some marine life. Considering the depth and irreversible nature of changes brought about by climate change in the region, Indigenous peoples are finding their cultural and social well-being affected at unprecedented rates.
For peoples closely connected to the land, ways of knowing are challenged to keep pace with the change around them. This is affecting cultural and social norms, such as engaging youth on the land, accessing country foods, gathering medicinal plants and protecting water sources. Indigenous communities need tools and knowledge that are locally and culturally appropriate to adapt to these urgent issues.
If there is a single argument for a collaborative approach to a shared Arctic and northern future, it is the shared and complex challenges posed by climate change. The response of all partners to this challenge must be no less transformative in scale, scope or duration.
As the sea-ice pack recedes and cold-weather technologies improve, the Arctic and the North region are also becoming increasingly accessible for a broad range of activities, including:
- fishing
- tourism
- scientific research
- shipping, both small and large vessels
- other commercial activities
Increasing numbers of domestic and international resource developers are being drawn to the region, resulting in a mix of optimism about economic prospects and concerns about potential environmental, social and security impacts. Higher levels of activity also increase the acute security risks associated with irregular movements of people and goods, the pursuit of foreign interests and human-induced disasters. As a whole, these changes highlight the importance of enhancing situational awareness across the region, and of promoting research and observation, including charting and mapping, that will provide the information necessary for sound decision-making.
A collaborative approach to climate change research is underway in the region, bringing together Inuit organizations, northern communities, federal and provincial agencies and the private sector. This effort is directed at understanding how climate change will affect communities and biodiversity. However, the current lack of baseline data poses major challenges to evidence-based decision-making. The responsible use of data can help cultivate a better understanding of the 'big picture' of environmental issues, contributing to the development of informed, data-driven policy and decisions that can help Arctic and northern communities build resiliency in the face of climate change.
Other currents are also driving change in the lives of Arctic and northern people. The place of the Arctic in the global consciousness has changed enormously over the past few years.
- Growing global interest in the region has been shown by several non-Arctic states and actors in Europe and Asia that have developed Arctic policies or strategies.
- Increased interest in the Arctic reflects concern about the global impacts of climate-driven changes in the region, including its increasing strategic and military importance.
There are already national and international efforts to ensure that growing international interest does not lead to additional problems for people in the region. For instance, the International Maritime Organization's Polar Code has mandated that larger ships travelling in polar waters are better equipped than previously, and their crews better prepared.
In particular, the idea of the ""Northwest Passage"" continues to stir the imagination of people around the world. While transiting the various waterways that are commonly referred to as the ""Northwest Passage"" may be increasingly feasible at certain times of the year due to diminishing ice coverage, extremely variable ice conditions continue to make navigation difficult and hazardous. Unregulated vessel traffic and accidents could have a devastating impact on Arctic and northern people and the unique environment in which they live. As these waterways are Canada's internal waters, Canada will continue to manage vessel traffic within our national waters to ensure that navigation is conducted in accordance with our rigorous safety and environmental protection standards.
There are robust rules, norms and institutions in place that guide international affairs.
- The Arctic Council and other multilateral forums such as the Arctic Coast Guard Forum, Arctic Economic Council and various United Nations organizations, including the International Maritime Organization, make decisions affecting the region
- An extensive international legal framework applies to the Arctic Ocean, including the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea
- Canada is also a signatory to several legally-binding international agreements that address Arctic-specific issues
- Canada has bilateral relationships in place with other Arctic states to address issues of a bilateral nature
Territorial and provincial governments and Indigenous partners are regularly engaged in the development of Canada's international Arctic policy through a well-established mechanism, and are often members of the Canadian delegation to international meetings and negotiations. Canada strongly believes that the rules-based international order in the Arctic and the North has been beneficial to national and global interests by helping to foster peace, security and stability for the region.
Through the wide range of activities undertaken by the Government of Canada, its partners and local communities, Canada's enduring sovereignty over its Arctic and northern lands and waters is continually expressed. Canada's sovereignty over the region is long-standing, well-established and based on historic title, and founded in part on the presence of Inuit and First Nations since time immemorial.
The Canadian Armed Forces play a key role in demonstrating Canada's sovereignty across all of its territory. In the Arctic and the North, this is undertaken through:
- an established and permanent presence, with the Joint Task Force — North headquarters in Yellowknife, Northwest Territories
- detachments in Iqaluit, Nunavut and Whitehorse, Yukon
- the 5 Wing Goose Bay base in Labrador which protects North American airspace and also supports military training
- the Canadian Rangers which serve as the military's eyes and ears in remote and northern communities.
The Canadian Armed Forces conduct:
- regular operations and exercises in the Arctic and the North to enhance their ability to operate and demonstrate presence
- air, land and sea patrols
- air and sea search and rescue activities
- monitor and control airspace through the North American Aerospace Defence Command (NORAD) network
- work with government and community partners to ensure safety and security in the region.
What we heard and what we know
Broad engagement with Arctic and northern people and other interested Canadians was an important element in the co-development of this document. The engagement helped shape the content of this framework, as did the work undertaken by territorial, provincial and Indigenous partners in developing their own priorities. This includes foundational documents developed by public governments, such as the Pan-Territorial Vision for Sustainable Development, as well as those of Indigenous governments and organizations.
""To create a better North for our children, the focus needs to be on what forms of knowledge and skills exist within our communities and how the federal government can assist in building upon and supporting these strengths. This means focusing on what we have versus focusing on what we lack, and valuing our existing capacity over voices that tell us we are not capable.""
— ""We Are One Mind"" report, written submission
Arctic and northern leadership
During public engagement on the framework, participants underscored the importance of decision-making about the Arctic and north moving closer to the region. The need for Arctic and northern leadership in crafting solutions, and the necessity of stable and accessible funding for federal programming, were often given as conditions for progress on regional challenges. Building capacity in regional organizations was also identified as a key part of developing leadership.
Participants highlighted the importance of building upon previous strategies, policies and agreements, notably land claim agreements and Canada's commitment to fully implement the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. They want to see full implementation of economic, social and cultural rights, as laid out in the land claims and in the declaration. They also want to see implementation of provisions related to economic development and land use planning.
Strong people and communities
Views expressed through the engagement sessions varied widely, but for many participants the theme of ""strong Arctic and northern people and communities"" was seen as the most central to the development of the new Arctic and Northern Policy Framework for Canada. Institutions and services rooted in local cultures and language were a widespread prescription for addressing social challenges, and for building strong people and communities. There was concern about the erosion of Indigenous languages, and a demand for programs that would assist with the revitalization of language and culture.
- In 2014, about 22% of Northwest Territories households indicated that they often or sometimes worried that food would run out before they had money to buy more
- Just under 70% of Inuit households in Nunavut are food insecure
Life expectancy is considered one of the most fundamental indicators of the overall health and wellness of a population, given that it is influenced by a range of factors including access to health care, nutrition, living conditions and lifestyle. Gaps are stark and striking. For instance, life expectancy for Inuit in Canada is 72.4 years versus 82.9 years for Canada's non-Indigenous population.
- 52% of Inuit in Inuit Nunangat live in crowded homes, which are associated with high rates of communicable disease such as tuberculosis, as well as other challenges, compared to 9% of Canadians overall
- In 2016 18% of Northwest Territories households required major repairs compared to the Canadian rate of 6.5%
References to social challenges, and especially those affecting the Indigenous peoples of the region, were common during the framework engagement sessions. Statistics make it clear that not everybody is similarly disadvantaged. For instance, income inequality does not only exist between the Arctic and the North and the rest of Canada; there is also considerable income inequality within the region itself. The median before-tax individual income for Inuit in Inuit Nunangat is 75% lower than for non-Indigenous residents.
While some of the highest median and average incomes in Canada are found in the region, this should not mask the fact that the costs of living and the rates of poverty and food insecurity are also among the highest in the country. In 2017, for instance, the Nunatsiavut Government Household Food Security Survey identified that food insecure households in Nunatsiavut are over 4 times the level reported in Newfoundland and Labrador, and over 5 times the level of food insecurity in Canada overall.
The deep and ongoing impact on Indigenous peoples of the residential school experience and the broader colonial legacy were consistent themes at regional roundtables, especially when participants spoke of language and culture, education and Indigenous knowledge. Some participants called upon the framework to support the implementation of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission Calls to Action. Links have been made between the intergenerational trauma caused by the impacts of the residential school system and the high rates of substance abuse and suicide in Indigenous populations.
""For many Yukon First Nations, the legacy of colonization continues and the impacts are both real and present. The underlying mental illness experienced by many First Nations is a normal human response to very abnormal conditions brought on by intergenerational impacts of colonization.""
— Yukon First Nations Mental Wellness Workbook
Education and skills development, including early childhood education, improvements in elementary, secondary and post-secondary education, access to higher education as well as the need to enhance opportunities for local higher education in the region, were raised in regional roundtables and other forms of engagement. In written submissions and during stakeholder roundtables, industry representatives talked about the need for more qualified local workers, and about matching education and training with job opportunities. Youth similarly saw education as a path to participating in the local economy, and called for higher-quality education. Participants in engagement sessions described how students from the region graduating with high school diplomas found that their available selection of high school courses or levels of knowledge did not match the requirements of post-secondary education.
- 34% of Inuit in Inuit Nunangat aged 25 to 64 have a high school diploma compared to 86% of Canadians aged 25 to 64 with a high school diploma
- In 2016, nearly three-quarters, 74%, of 25 to 64 year old Northwest Territories non-Indigenous residents had a postsecondary certificate, diploma or degree compared to 43% of Indigenous peoples
""Employment and education are inextricably linked, with 83 per cent of residents 15 years of age and older with post-secondary education having a job, compared to an employment rate of 49 per cent for those without a post-secondary diploma, certificate or degree. Employment and education also have strong linkages to reduced issues related to health, crime and housing.""
— Mandate of the Government of the Northwest Territories 2016–2019 (revised)
The provision of health-care services can be challenging in the Arctic and the North due to the lack of infrastructure and trained professionals, the small populations spread out over vast distances and the need to deliver services in an inclusive, culturally appropriate and responsive manner. Access to health care in the region is currently not comparable to the average Canadian's access to high quality care.
- Hospitals and specialized health services are often not locally available
- Many people are forced to fly out from their home communities to access specialized care, or to give birth
In addition to facing barriers to care, people face disproportionate health challenges.
- In 2014, the rate of new or retreatment cases of tuberculosis was almost 50 times higher in the Inuit population than in the Canadian population overall
Mental health facilities and services are also generally lacking. The severity of mental health challenges in Arctic and northern communities, including the unacceptably high rate of suicide among Indigenous peoples (particularly youth), was a common theme at regional engagement sessions. For example, the rate of self-injury hospitalizations in Labrador is 231 per 100,000. That is more than 3 times the Canadian average. These health outcomes are further complicated by social determinants of health, such as overcrowded housing, high unemployment and low formal education levels.
The importance of local partnerships with municipalities, regional Indigenous associations and development corporations, chambers of commerce and others emerged at roundtable discussions and in written submissions. Local governments, including Indigenous governments and institutions, play a special role in a region which includes urban centres as well as many smaller communities dispersed over large areas.
Municipalities and other forms of local and regional government play key roles in developing and supporting Arctic and northern communities, and are integral to addressing challenges such as housing, health and education.Footnote 6 Many communities are already taking actions that contribute to the goals and objectives of this framework.
""Northern and remote communities play a critical role in delivering essential services. Working with citizens, the private sector, civil society and other orders of government, Arctic municipalities improve the social, economic and environmental well-being of their communities.""
— Jenny Gerbasi, President, Federation of Canadian Municipalities, written submission
Comprehensive infrastructure
Infrastructure concerns were a common theme in engagement, including the need for transformative investments in infrastructure, rather than a remedial approach that only perpetuates a state of crisis.
Almost everyone who spoke about infrastructure mentioned reliable broadband access as a priority, given its role in enabling business, research, education, justice and health.
""With only 1 access into Yukon, 1 misstep from a backhoe operator in British Columbia knocks out the internet across the territory. No telehealth, banking, purchasing of gasoline or supplies, on-line education, and general office use — gone in an instant.""
— Association of Yukon Communities, written submission
""'All weather roads, rail, air and broadband were among the most common topics to arise in conversation in the north.""
— Look North report and action plan
Other highlighted infrastructure needs included:
- improved charting and mapping
- energy infrastructure
- better port facilities
- better airport facilities
- reliable rail networks
- roads to access communities and mineral resources
On a more local level, insufficient housing is a chronic problem in many northern communities. The lack of housing is linked to several other poor health and social outcomes.
- In Nunavik, no communities have all-season roads or connection to a regional energy grid, 58% have suitable housing, and 35% have access to a terrestrial backbone for internet communications.
Rather than simply expressing a desire for greater federal investment, communities and organizations emphasized their desire for partnerships and opportunities to play an active and constructive role in infrastructure investments through, for example, financial partnership, as well as the development of business capacity and skills. They noted that new infrastructure must come with a local capacity to maintain it, and that its construction should bring local jobs and wealth. Territorial governments, through their participation in the co-development process and in strategic documents such as the Pan-Territorial Vision for Sustainable Development, have pointed to large-scale infrastructure investments as foundational to creating economic opportunity and prosperity for Indigenous communities.
The Government of Canada has provided funding to restore rail service on the Hudson Bay Railway Line, which is expected to grow into a key transportation and export hub serving both
international markets and northern Canada. The rail line acquisition by the Arctic Gateway Group represents a historic partnership which combines First Nations and community ownership with private sector leadership. Restoration of the rail line opens the door for economic investments and opportunities for the town of Churchill and northern Manitoba residents and reflects a shared priority to strengthen transportation infrastructure for Canada's Arctic and North.
Strong, sustainable and diversified economies
Economic development was often mentioned by participants as a key theme. Territorial and provincial governments emphasized that regional economies will need to be built upon both sustainable resource extraction and the development of other sectors. They also highlighted that entrepreneurial research and innovation will help in strengthening and diversifying their economies.
""Supporting small business development across the Arctic is key to diversifying the economy, creating sustainable industries that are alternatives to extractive industries, and facilitating young people to stay within their communities rather than having to move for employment.""
— Gwich'in Council International, written submission
- The National Aboriginal Economic Development Board estimated in 2016 that the Indigenous peoples employed in the 3 territories could make an additional $1.1 billion in annual income if they had the same education and training as non-Indigenous people working in the territories
At the roundtables, a thriving economy was linked to foundational elements such as a skilled workforce, social and physical infrastructure, diversity and meaningful opportunities. Stakeholders and experts approached economic development issues from differing perspectives. In public submissions, some saw the answer in more support for non-renewable resource development such as mining. In 2017, mining was the largest private sector contributor to the economies of the Northwest Territories and Nunavut: the 6 mines operating in the territories spent over a billion dollars within the jurisdictions. Documents such as the Pan-Territorial Vision for Economic Development, Quebec's Plan Nord, and Manitoba's Look North Report and Action Plan all highlight the place of resource development in supporting a robust economy.
""Responsible [mining] means meeting socio-economic commitments (including economic, employment and community development commitments); acting in an environmentally responsible manner; and protecting the health and safety of our employees and the Peoples of the North.""
— Mission statement, Northwest Territories (NWT) and Nunavut Chamber of Mines
""The benefits of developing a sustainable, community-driven tourism industry range from healthier lifestyles for youth, to cultural preservation, to new economic opportunities for elders and youth.""
— Parnasimautik Consultation Report, Nunavik
Participants from the business community suggested that by articulating a long-term, strategic vision for the Arctic and the North, the Government of Canada would provide greater certainty for industry and incentivize investments in larger-scale projects. Organizations representing Indigenous economic development corporations and small business interests noted needs for increased access to capital and business supports, as well as more supportive federal procurement policies. There was also a common view that economic development could be facilitated through greater access to international markets. Academics called for the identification and development of alternative economic approaches, including innovation, arts and crafts, and traditional or cultural activities. Some representatives of Indigenous and non-governmental organizations cautioned against a reliance on major projects. They stressed the importance of land-based or traditional economic activity, as well as the potential of ""conservation economies"" focused on connections between culture, communities and local ecosystems.
Science and Indigenous knowledge
""For Inuit, economic development must be guided by Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit (Inuit knowledge)….. Taking this approach applies an Inuit worldview to decisions and action that influence Inuit lives""
— P.J. Akeeagok, President, Qikiqtani Inuit Association, in A New Approach to Economic Development in Nunavut, 2018
At regional roundtables, conversations about knowledge creation often focused on the relationship between communities and researchers, as well as the place of Indigenous peoples in research, including the role of Indigenous knowledge. Participants described both science and Indigenous knowledge as valid and equal contributors to knowledge-building and decision-making in the region. Participants also expressed the desire for stronger local and Indigenous involvement in setting and determining research priorities as well as carrying out research. Prioritizing stronger involvement in the research process means that it is crucial to expand the research capacity of communities and strengthen local and regional research infrastructure and institutions. Indigenous knowledge also has an important role in informing international policies that in turn affect Arctic Indigenous peoples.
""Gwich'in need to be directly represented in the key decision-making forums about research to ensure that research is responding to community desires for information into the issues that are important to them. Moreover, there is a need for increased funding to support the collection and analysis of Indigenous knowledge.""
— Gwich'in Tribal Council, written submission
The importance of social science research was also brought forward, as it can provide an essential evidence base for decisions and policies that meet the needs of Arctic, northern and Indigenous communities. For research to give people a full base for decision-making it should include elements which are not only university-led and partnership-based, but also locally-led and accessible though regionally-based institutions. It was also noted that the vast majority of funds spent on Arctic and northern research are spent in the south. Communities want improved sharing of the results and benefits of research with the communities where the research is being conducted. Many of these points brought up in engagement sessions are also emphasised by territorial research documents and Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami's National Inuit Strategy on Research.
Protecting the environment and conserving biodiversity
""For Inuit the purpose of conservation is the creation of socio-economic and cultural equity between Inuit and all other Canadians, while considering reconciliation, climate change, and, ecological integrity.""
— Qikiqtani Inuit Association (Nunavut), written submission
The social and environmental impacts of climate change were recurring themes at all regional roundtables. Those impacts affect a broad range of issues, from infrastructure to housing to security. At stakeholder roundtables, many people felt that adaptation activities should take precedence over mitigation actions in the region, considering its small emissions footprint versus the magnified impacts. Another key message was the need for more robust mitigation activities from southern Canada and major international emitters.
Conservation issues drew a varied response. Some engagement participants emphasized the need to reduce development impacts on wildlife. The harvesting of country foods, particularly caribou herds, provides nutrition, food security and the continuation of traditional practices for many Indigenous peoples. Others expressed concerns over the weight of regulation and its impact on resource development. Co-management of renewable resources was highlighted as a venue for collaborative management that can help integrate different viewpoints. There was a recognition that protected areas are unable to guard Arctic and northern ecosystems against pollution and climate change with distant origins. There was also acknowledgement that a holistic approach to conservation activities can make an overall positive contribution to the region. Suggested options for such an approach included:
- the advancement of concepts such as Indigenous-led conservation and monitoring
- Indigenous protected and conserved areas
- conservation economies, through which conservation becomes an integral aspect of local economies
The global context
""As we see it, the barriers to feeling empowered and healthy are not neatly segmented into 'domestic' and 'international' boxes. As a nation which spans across territorial and international boundaries, the issues that concern Gwich'in are at the same time both local and international.""
— Gwich'in Council International, written submission
There were some consistent key messages on international issues raised by participants from all regions. They included a desire to maintain the circumpolar Arctic as a region of peace and cooperation through efforts to strengthen the international rules and institutions that govern the Arctic. Preserving the role of the Arctic Council as the leading forum for circumpolar cooperation was singled out as a priority by many participants.
Engagement participants would also like to see Canada target its international cooperation in areas that improve socio-economic living conditions. For example, strengthening north-to-north cooperation through forums such as the Arctic Council and at the sub-national level was encouraged, including exchanges of knowledge and best practices on issues such as:
- mental wellness
- education
- Indigenous languages
- renewable energy
Indigenous participants were particularly interested in improved mobility of Indigenous peoples and cultural goods throughout the circumpolar region. Participants called for:
- strengthening the voice of Indigenous peoples in international Arctic forums including increased support for the Indigenous Permanent Participants at the Arctic Council
- Canada to take a strong stand on protecting Indigenous rights to self-determination, pursuing sustainable harvesting of flora and fauna and combatting international efforts that negatively affect these rights
People who spoke or wrote in also expressed a desire to see Canada play a leadership role on the global stage when it comes to addressing climate change, contaminants and other environmental challenges that have a disproportionate impact on the region.
Safety, security and defence
Throughout the engagement process, participants highlighted the transformative role of climate change in increasing commercial interest and activity in the region. Questions around environmental protection and response, safe regional transportation, and search and rescue capabilities were raised as critical issues, especially in the context of a rapidly changing climate.
In response to rapid regional changes, roundtable participants recognized the need for a whole-of-government approach to safety, security and defence. As part of this, increased presence in the region by the Canadian Armed Forces and the Canadian Coast Guard was highlighted as an important response, in conjunction with clear communication and engagement with local people. The Canadian Rangers were identified as an important presence in the region, and support was expressed for enhancing and expanding the Rangers' training and effectiveness. In addition, participants expressed appreciation for the way in which the Canadian Armed Forces consult local communities and Indigenous groups, and called for such collaboration to be continued.
Participants noted that partnering with communities and investing in regional infrastructure will solidify Canada's regional presence while exercising its sovereignty, and that existing partnerships can be expanded through collaboration, information sharing and training.
Indigenous youth
""Youth across the Arctic understand that education is a portal to opportunity. They aspire to a quality education equivalent to other Canadians: an education that also reaffirms the central role of their culture and Indigenous languages in their identity as Canadians. A new Arctic Policy Framework, if it is to separate itself from many previous documents on the future of the Arctic, must speak to these young voices in this era of reconciliation.""
– A New Shared Arctic Leadership Model
Youth are transforming the region by their very numbers: in Canada, the median age is just over 40; in Nunavut, it is just over 26. These booming populations of young people are producing many great successes as artists, as leaders and in other walks of life. However, figures show that there are still many obstacles and challenges to being well, succeeding at school and finding meaningful work.
""To move forward in any aspect in life and in our society, we need to be educated. The youth want to be well with who they are and where they come from. Youth also understand the importance of quality, formal education so they can become active members of their communities and society and have access to all levels of employment in the communities, region or elsewhere if that is what they choose.""
— Qarjuit Youth Council, Nunavik
Today's young Indigenous leaders are eager to build upon the work of previous generations. As stated in the report We Are One Mind, Perspectives from Emerging Indigenous Leaders on the Arctic Policy Framework, the Arctic and Northern Policy Framework must be people-centric to be effective. The report, which was developed by the Indigenous youth collectives Dene Nahjo, Our Voices and Qanak, contains 25 recommendations organized under 3 themes:
- Northerners leading northern policy engagement
- Investing in land, language and culture for future generations and as the basis for a healthy society
- Healthy lands, healthy economies
The report urges the federal and territorial governments to act in a timely manner to resolve existing unsettled land claims and self-government agreements. It recommends the establishment of a ministerial working group to review federal legislative impediments that exclude northerners from accessing federal programs or impose inappropriate regulations on people and communities, and recommends that the federal and territorial governments update their consultation frameworks to address gaps and redundancies.
Our future
The Government of Canada and its partners will close the gaps and divides that exist between this region, particularly in relation to its Indigenous peoples, and the rest of the country. The clear and ambitious goals and objectives of this framework point the way to a vibrant, sustainable and prosperous future.
In our shared future, Canada's Arctic and North will no longer be pushed to the margins of the national community.
- Its people will be full participants in Canadian society, with access to the same services, opportunities and standards of living as those enjoyed by other Canadians
- The resources required for their physical and mental wellness will be accessible
We will endeavour to create an environment in the Arctic and North in which youth will get the education they need to thrive, and Indigenous peoples receive the support required for their languages and cultures to be not only maintained, but revitalized.
We will encourage development that is environmentally and socially sustainable, that employs local people and creates wealth in the region. Stewardship of Arctic and northern lands, waters and resources will be accomplished through new and existing measures, including support of Indigenous stewardship and Indigenous protected and conserved areas. The Pikialasorsuaq (North Water polynya) between Canada and Greenland and Thaidene Nëné National Park Reserve in Northwest Territories are 2 examples of proposed Indigenous protected areas.
We will work to fill knowledge gaps in the Arctic and the North in a way that is responsive to the needs of local governments and people, and enables and encourages their participation in all aspects of the research process. We will define knowledge inclusively, embracing the contributions of Indigenous knowledge as well as western science.
We will support a rules-based international order in the Arctic that prioritizes human and environmental security and meaningful engagement of Arctic and northern peoples, especially Indigenous peoples. We will reduce barriers to the freedom of Indigenous peoples to move freely across international boundaries that now separate families and cultures.
Realizing this shared future will mean doing things differently to address persistent social and economic challenges in the Arctic and the North. We know that closing the gaps between the region and the rest of Canada means closing gaps between where decisions and resources are based, and where the needs are. Closing the gaps requires greater effort, focus, trust and collaboration, and more self-determination for the peoples of the region.
Reconciliation with Indigenous peoples
""Recognizing …the disproportionate socio-economic and cultural inequity facing Inuit compared to most other Canadians, and committing to working in partnership to create socio-economic and cultural equity between Inuit and other Canadians. This commitment includes energetically and creatively pursuing the socio-economic, cultural, and environmental conditions of success through the full implementation of land claims agreements as well as reconciliation""
— Inuit Nunangat Declaration on Inuit-Crown Partnership
Ongoing reconciliation with Indigenous peoples is foundational to achieving the goals and objectives of the Arctic and Northern Policy Framework.
The negotiation and full implementation of land claims and self-government agreements are key components of reconciliation. They require recognition within the framework as part of the continuation and renewal of relationships. These continued and renewed relationships come with a strong foundation, including the Principles Respecting the Government of Canada's Relationship with Indigenous Peoples.
In 2015, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau accepted the Final Report of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission on behalf of the Government of Canada and committed to a renewed nation-to-nation relationship with Indigenous peoples based on recognition of rights, respect, co-operation and partnership.
In 2016, the Government of Canada committed to renewing the relationship with First Nations, Inuit and Métis peoples through the creation of permanent bilateral mechanisms.
- All 4 Inuit regions have settled land claims
- Agreements on land and governance rights have been signed with First Nations and Metis across much of their traditional territories in the Arctic and the North
The fundamental instruments that define the Indigenous-Crown relationship are treaties, historic and modern, underpinned by section 35 of the Constitution Act of 1982. Each treaty established a unique relationship between Indigenous peoples and various levels of government. These relationships provide the foundation for a just and lasting reconciliation, founded in the honour of the Crown with federal, provincial and territorial governments. Implementing modern treaties is a shared responsibility, which Canada will work with Indigenous peoples, provinces and territories to realize.
The work of reconciliation is not only happening at the federal level, it has also been undertaken by Indigenous peoples, by Arctic and northern governments and through other mechanisms. Reconciliation in the region is intertwined with political evolution and is ongoing. Progress has been made on this path, led in large part by Indigenous and non-Indigenous citizens who have worked together to secure and implement land and self-government agreements, evolve public governments, and find practical ways to work together for the shared goals of improving the quality of life for their children and sound stewardship of land and resources.
Assuming global leadership
Canada will strengthen its international leadership on Arctic and northern issues at this critical time, as the region undergoes rapid environmental change and international interest surges.
Canada's ambition is to robustly support the rules-based international order in the Arctic, and all its institutions, and to seek ways to strengthen and improve those institutions for the 21st century.
Canada will:
- work collaboratively with Indigenous peoples and territorial and provincial governments in the multilateral forums where decisions that impact the Arctic are made, including the Arctic Council and United Nations organizations
- enhance bilateral cooperation with Arctic and key non-Arctic states and actors
Canadian leadership will be advanced bilaterally and in multilateral forums in order to promote Canadian values and interests such as human and environmental security.
Our shared ambition includes:
- better leveraging our international Arctic engagement to address domestic priorities such as social and economic development
- enhanced knowledge of our Arctic and North
- environmental protection
In a globalized world, many of the issues facing Canada, including in the Arctic and the North, cannot be addressed effectively through domestic action alone. A whole-of-government effort that leverages both domestic and international policy levers is therefore required. For example, economic growth in Canada's Arctic and North can be facilitated through infrastructure investments that increase access to world markets, along with trade commissioner services to help businesses based in the region access international markets and attract and retain foreign direct investment that benefits Northerners and respects Canada's national interest.
Promoting sustainable development
A key international commitment that informs this framework is the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Canada has committed to implementing and measuring progress toward these goals.
The United Nations 2030 Sustainable Development Goals
- End poverty in all its forms everywhere
- End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture
- Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages
- Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all
- Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls
- Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all
- Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all
- Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all
- Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation
- Reduce inequality within and among countries
- Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable
- Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns
- Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts
- Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development
- Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss
- Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels
- Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development
Adopted in 2015, the 2030 Agenda is an ambitious 15-year global framework with 17 goals that cover the economic, social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development, and integrate peace, governance and justice elements. It is universal in nature, meaning that implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals is a commitment to take action domestically within Canada, as well as internationally, to eradicate poverty and leave no one behind.
These goals fit well with what we have heard regarding the need to narrow gaps between Arctic and northern Indigenous peoples and other Canadians. We intend to match our ambition in the framework, domestically and internationally, to the ambition expressed in the Sustainable Development Goals. This ambition is expressed in the framework's goals and objectives, and aligns closely with the Pan-Territorial Vision for Sustainable Development principle that ""the territories will stand together to create long term sustainable development of northern economies."" The Pan-Territorial Vision indicates that this will be achieved through environmentally responsible and sustainable resource development, job creation and economic diversification.
A safe and secure Arctic and North, now and into the future
The qualities that make the Canadian Arctic and North such a special place, its size, climate, and small but vibrant and resilient populations, also pose unique security challenges, making it difficult to maintain situational awareness and respond to emergencies or military threats when and where they occur. These difficulties are often compounded by the effects and accelerating pace of climate change, making the region both environmentally changed and increasingly accessible to a broad range of actors and interests.
To protect the safety and security of people in the region and safeguard the ability to defend the Canadian Arctic and North, and North America now and into the future, a multi-faceted and holistic approach is required. The complexity of the regional security environment places a premium on collaboration amongst all levels of government, Indigenous peoples and local communities, as well as with trusted international partners, and we will continue to improve the ways we work together to keep pace with the evolving challenges.
The Government of Canada is taking steps to augment its Arctic and northern footprint in support of regional safety and security, including through Canada's defence policy Strong, Secure, Engaged, and through key elements of the Oceans Protection Plan. Canada will enhance the Canadian Armed Forces' presence in the region over the long term by setting out the capability investments that will give the Canadian Armed Forces the tools they need to help local people in times of need and to operate effectively in the region.
Under the Oceans Protection Plan, the Canadian Coast Guard will continue to enhance its:
- maritime search and rescue capacity, including through an expanding Coast Guard Arctic Auxiliary
- capacity to respond to maritime environmental emergencies
- icebreaking capacity
- its capacity to contribute to Maritime Domain Awareness
Canada's ability to respond to regional challenges, provide security and ensure compliance with our laws and regulations largely depends on our ability to build and maintain a comprehensive picture of what is happening across the region, as gaps can have life-threatening consequences. For example, increased maritime and cross-border traffic creates new challenges for border enforcement and effective vessel tracking, such as illicit drugs and illegal imports. This is why it is so critical for partners to work together to develop strong domain awareness, including through information sharing, enhanced coordination, the acquisition of new air, land, sea and space-based capabilities, and exploration of innovative solutions to surveillance challenges in the Arctic and the North.
Goals and objectives
Goal 1: Canadian Arctic and northern Indigenous peoples are resilient and healthy
There are unacceptable gaps in health and social development outcomes between Arctic and northern Indigenous peoples and most other Canadians. The poor health outcomes in the region are directly linked to both inadequate access to treatment options and to serious social problems, including:
- a critical shortage of housing
- low educational attainment levels
- high rates of incarceration and unemployment, particularly in smaller communities
Climate-driven changes are worsening the risks to Indigenous peoples in the region, such as travel over traditional routes. As well, a high cost of living and changes in the availability and accessibility of traditional foods have resulted in rising rates of food insecurity. For example, 1 in 2 households in Nunavut are food insecure. Eliminating food insecurity includes both affordable food from the grocery store, as well as having access to traditional food to support a healthy diet, community well-being and connection to local cultures and traditions.
Life expectancy is a key index of a population's wellbeing. Projected life expectancy for Inuit in Canada is 10.5 years below that of Canada's non-Indigenous population. While the most recent Statistics Canada information on First Nations and Métis is not disaggregated by region, at a national level First Nations and Métis were found to have a projected life expectancy rate of approximately 4 to 5 years below that enjoyed by non-Indigenous Canadians.
- One study shows that northern populations suffer from the lowest life expectancy in Canada
- Another study finds that life expectancy is approximately 7 to 12 years lower in areas with a high concentration of Inuit, First Nations and Métis
- Rates of communicable disease and suicide are much higher among Arctic and northern Indigenous populations than elsewhere in Canada
- Violence is being perpetrated against Indigenous women and girls, with the likelihood of violent death being significantly higher for Indigenous than for non-Indigenous women, according to statistics cited in the 2019 final report of the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls
Together, we will close these stark gaps, taking a distinctions-based approach that respects the unique rights, interests and circumstances of Inuit, First Nations and Métis peoples.
Meeting this goal will depend on progress on other objectives, including economic development, public safety, justice and reconciliation. Adaptation and resilience-building measures will be required to respond to the climate-driven change happening now, and projected for the future. Cultural revival will play a role in resilience. Land-based activities and practices will support education, healing and well-being. Solutions advanced in other Arctic states that face similar challenges will also be examined. Strong communities in our North can be supported by the circumpolar exchange of knowledge and best practices. Freer movement of Indigenous peoples and cultural goods across Canada's international boundaries in the Arctic and the North will further strengthen long-standing familial and cultural ties.
Goal 1 objectives
- End poverty
- Eradicate hunger
- Eliminate homelessness and overcrowding
- Reduce suicides
- Strengthen mental and physical wellbeing
- Create an environment in which children will thrive, through a focus on education, culture, health and well-being
- Close the gaps in education outcomes
- Provide ongoing learning and skills development opportunities, including Indigenous-based knowledge and skills
- Strengthen Indigenous cultural and family connections across international boundaries
- Address the systemic causes of all forms of violence against Indigenous women and girls
- End the over-representation of Indigenous peoples in Canada's criminal justice system
- Implement culturally-appropriate approaches to justice issues, such as restorative justice measures and other alternative measures to incarceration
Goal 2: Strengthened infrastructure that closes gaps with other regions of Canada
As a gap experienced by every person in the Arctic and the North, infrastructure is a top priority of this framework. Canada is investing in transformative infrastructure corridors to achieve more efficient and effective communications, clean energy and transportation. We also need to address deficits in weather and climate monitoring, particularly in climate-sensitive sectors. The National Aboriginal Economic Development Board has estimated that every dollar invested in transportation and energy infrastructure can generate more than 10 times that amount.
We commit to creating economic opportunity and prosperity for northerners, and to better enabling Canada's northern and Arctic regions to catch up to other areas of Canada.
There are significant transportation infrastructure deficits in the region.
- Approximately 70 communities are only accessible year-round by air, or seasonally by water or ice roads
- Marine and aviation infrastructure is the gateway for many northern and Arctic communities and needs improvement
The limited transportation infrastructure makes it difficult, time-consuming and expensive to move passengers and goods in and out of communities, and to deliver government programs and services. Infrastructure deficits are also a significant restriction on trade and commerce.
Climate change threatens the resilience of existing infrastructure and presents challenges to constructing new infrastructure. The costs, sustainability and reliability of energy are a concern, with nearly two-thirds of Arctic and northern communities relying exclusively on diesel, which is expensive, difficult to transport and a source of greenhouse gases.
Many communities rely exclusively on satellite for access to internet services; they lack access to the fast, high quality and reliable telecommunications networks that people need to enable economic growth, education, health and research.
Goal 2 objectives
- Investment in significant infrastructure projects
- Fast, reliable, and affordable broadband connectivity for all
- Expand multi-modal transportation infrastructure and operations to connect communities to Canadian and international opportunities and improve access to essential services
- Develop multi-purpose corridors for broadband, energy and transportation, including connections to hydroelectricity grids
- Achieve energy security and sustainability in all communities and improve access to reliable, affordable and clean energy solutions
- Integrate climate change resilience into new and existing infrastructure
- Strengthen community-level infrastructure, including social infrastructure
- Enhance monitoring infrastructure for the collection and use of weather and climate data
Goal 3: Strong, sustainable, diversified and inclusive local and regional economies
A strong economy contributes to the resilience of Arctic and northern communities and sustainable growth that benefits all Canadians. However, northern economic development is challenged by higher operating costs for businesses due to the region's small and dispersed population, sparse infrastructure and higher energy and connectivity costs.
Limited access to formal or higher education, a barrier to local participation in the workforce, especially amongst Indigenous peoples, highlights the need for policies which aim to foster increased mobility as a means of supporting education and employment paths.
For many small businesses, access to professional support, such as banking and legal services, is limited. As stated in the Pan-Territorial Vision for Sustainable Development, ""responsible, sustainable resource development and job creation is the cornerstone of the territorial economies. Indigenous ownership, investment and participation in the resource industry are key to the success of this sector."" There is also a need to grow other areas to help insulate northern economies from the ""boom and bust"" cycle, and to provide more diversity of opportunity for Arctic and northern peoples. This will grow the middle class and build a diverse, prosperous and truly inclusive economy, where all can realize their full potential.
We will support local economies, such as sealing, fishing, hunting and crafts. Measures aimed at fostering innovation, diversification and promoting access to domestic and foreign markets will support both existing and future economic activities.
Achieving sustainable economies will also require the provision of long-term employment and other benefits to Arctic and northern people, along with a central role in decision-making. The resolution of land and governance rights and the negotiation of benefits underpin economic development. Canada is committed to meaningfully consult with Indigenous peoples on resource and infrastructure projects in the decision-making process, in accordance with Aboriginal and treaty rights. Fulfilling consultation obligations while respecting the decision-making roles of Indigenous groups recognized within modern treaties can help realize inclusive economies.
Many areas within the region are expecting growth over the next decade, capitalizing on their considerable economic potential. Much of the growth will come from the natural resource sector, as well as other sectors such as:
- tourism
- commercial fisheries
- cultural industries
Certain economic sectors, including resource development, tourism and shipping, are expected to grow as climate change alters the northern environment, though these activities bring new risks for people, infrastructure and ecosystems and place additional stress on search and rescue and disaster response capacity. To ensure that local and regional economies are able to grow sustainably, climate change considerations will need to be taken into account.
International trade and foreign investment are important contributors to growth, by helping Arctic and northern businesses:
- take advantage of global export opportunities made possible by existing and new free trade agreements
- attract and retain foreign direct investment in a way that enhances economic development and environmental protection while ensuring Canada's national security interests
Goal 3 objectives
- Increase Indigenous participation in the economy
- Grow the northern and Arctic economy, to the benefit of Northerners and all Canadians
- Increase retention of wealth in Canada's Arctic and North
- Reduce income inequality
- Drive innovation and support investments in cold climate resource extraction
- Optimize resource development, including the mining and energy sectors, while ensuring that this development is undertaken in a responsible, sustainable and inclusive manner
- Provide the necessary supports to help businesses grow
- Building on a strong economic base, foster economic diversification through innovation and partnerships
- Enhance opportunities for trade and investment
- Maximize economic opportunities flowing from infrastructure investments
Goal 4: Knowledge and understanding guides decision-making
Canada's Arctic and North is a region of significant interest to scientists and other researchers, domestically and internationally. Ongoing research and observation in the region seek to address knowledge gaps. Mapping and understanding climate change impacts, vulnerabilities and avenues to adaptation and resilience are keys tasks for research. Other tasks range from geological mapping to tracking species distribution to understanding the socio-economic and cultural impacts of development.
Arctic and Northern peoples want those knowledge gaps filled, but they also want changes to the way knowledge is gathered, created and shared. Our approach to Arctic and-northern research will feature:
- stronger regional and Indigenous involvement in the research process, including:setting prioritiesundertaking research itselfenhanced community-based observation
The research agenda will include more social science research to meet the pressing needs of communities. Indigenous knowledge and scientific knowledge will be equally considered in decision-making.
Collaboration at the international level plays a major role in addressing gaps in our knowledge of the region, particularly given the complexities, interconnectedness and costs related to Arctic and northern science.
Internationally, Canada will:
- bolster its efforts to champion Indigenous knowledge
- facilitate stronger international research collaboration
Indigenous knowledge holders as well as academic institutions and research facilities relating to natural sciences, social sciences and health have built an international reputation for high-quality knowledge and research, though more meaningful and equitable partnerships with Indigenous researchers and institutions must be achieved. The Canadian High Arctic Research Station campus in Nunavut is the newest addition to the pan-northern and Arctic network of research infrastructure welcoming scientists from all over the world.
Goal 4 objectives
- Ensure that Arctic and Northern people, including youth and all genders, play a leading role in developing research and other knowledge-creation agendas
- Ensure that Arctic and Northern people have the tools and research infrastructure to participate in all aspects of the knowledge creation process
- Increase support for health, social science and humanities research
- Create and store knowledge in a manner consistent with the self-determination of Indigenous peoples, balancing ethics, accessibility and culture
- Increase international polar science and research collaboration with full inclusion of Indigenous knowledge
- Work with partners to implement their research strategies
- Develop innovative technological solutions on widely-shared community and economic development needs
- Support development of data collection, production and measurement specifically focused on Arctic and Northern populations
- Reduce barriers to accessing research funding for Indigenous knowledge holders and organizations
Goal 5: Canadian Arctic and northern ecosystems are healthy and resilient
Climate change is a lived reality for Canada's Arctic and northern residents. The temperature in the Canadian Arctic has increased at a rate of 2 to 3 times the global average, which has placed immense pressure on Arctic and northern communities, ecosystems and infrastructure.
Rising temperatures are also:
- having widespread impacts on terrestrial and marine ecosystems
- exacerbating the effects of existing threats to biodiversity, such as:habitat shiftsinvasive alien species
Urgent action is needed to:
- mitigate climate change
- adapt to its current and future impacts
- promote and build resilience through efforts that:increase the availability of, and access to, locally relevant information for decision-makingbuild capacity to reduce risk
Environmental data gathered from information and warning services on weather, water, ice, climate and air quality are an important foundation for situational awareness and can be leveraged to better understand the impacts and risks of changing environmental conditions.
Addressing critical gaps in earth observation across Canada's Arctic and North, and adapting these services to the unique context and evolving needs of the region, will be essential to support effective decision-making.
This will enable communities to be:
- more prepared for emergencies
- better informed
- resilient when it comes to facing the challenges posed by climate change
Minimizing other environmental pressures, such as pollution, will help to reduce adverse effects. Sustainable management of natural resources, conservation of biodiversity and the safeguarding and restoration of ecosystems are necessary to protect the Arctic and northern environment and communities. Indigenous peoples continue to play a unique role in stewardship of northern ecosystems, including through guardians programs, which work to protect sensitive areas and species, monitor ecological health and maintain cultural sites.
Some of the most pressing environmental issues affecting Canada's Arctic and North, from climate change to contaminants to marine pollution, cannot be managed through domestic action alone as the sources of the problems largely originate in areas outside of the region. While these environmental issues are global in scope, there is a disproportionate impact on the health of northern Canadians, in particular on Indigenous peoples who live off the land. For this reason, Canada will play a leadership role in advocating for more timely and ambitious international action to address environmental challenges that have an impact on Arctic and northern environments and peoples.
Goal 5 objectives:
- Accelerate and intensify national and international reductions of greenhouse gas emissions and short-lived climate pollutants
- Ensure conservation, restoration and sustainable use of ecosystems and species
- Support sustainable use of species by Indigenous peoples
- Approach the planning, management and development of Arctic and northern environments in a holistic and integrated manner
- Partner with territories, provinces and Indigenous peoples to recognize, manage and conserve culturally and environmentally significant areas
- Facilitate greater understanding of climate change impacts and adaptation options through monitoring and research, including Indigenous-led and community-based approaches
- Enhance support for climate adaptation and resilience efforts
- Enhance understanding of the vulnerabilities of ecosystems and biodiversity and the effects of environmental change
- Ensure safe and environmentally-responsible shipping
- Decommission or remediate all contaminated sites
- Strengthen pollution prevention and mitigation regionally, nationally and internationally
Goal 6: The rules-based international order in the Arctic responds effectively to new challenges and opportunities
The circumpolar Arctic is well-known for its stability and high level of international cooperation, a product of the robust rules-based international order in the Arctic that Canada played an instrumental role in shaping. The rules-based international order is the sum of international rules, norms and institutions that govern international affairs. It benefits the national and global interest by fostering peace and stability for the Arctic; conditions which are necessary for Arctic and northern communities to thrive socially, economically and environmentally.
The international order is not static; it evolves over time to address new opportunities and challenges. The Arctic and the North is in a period of rapid change that is the product of both climate change and changing geopolitical trends. As such, international rules and institutions will need to evolve to address the new challenges and opportunities facing the region. As it has done in the past, Canada will bolster its international leadership at this critical time, in partnership with Northerners and Indigenous peoples, to ensure that the evolving international order is shaped in a manner that protects and promotes Canadian interests and values. These interests and values are widely shared by Arctic states and include:
- improving the lives of Indigenous peoples and Northerners
- protecting the region's fragile environment
- strengthening the voices of Northerners, especially Indigenous peoples
The international rules and institutions that form part of the rules-based international order will also play a critical role in helping Canada resolve our outstanding boundary disputes and continental shelf overlaps in the Arctic.
Goal 6 objectives
- Bolster Canadian leadership in multilateral forums where polar issues are discussed and decided upon
- Enhance the representation and participation of Arctic and northern Canadians in relevant international forums and negotiations
- Strengthen bilateral cooperation with Arctic and key non-Arctic states and actors
- Define more clearly Canada's marine areas and boundaries in the Arctic
Goal 7: The Canadian Arctic and North and its people are safe, secure and well-defended.
In the Arctic and the North, as in the rest of Canada, safety, security and defence are essential prerequisites for healthy communities, strong economies and a sustainable environment. Climate change is having far-reaching effects on the lives and well-being of northerners, threatening food security and the transportation of essential goods and endangering the stability and functioning of delicate ecosystems and critical infrastructure.
As the region becomes increasingly accessible due to the effects of climate change and improvements in cold-weather technologies, the region is emerging as an area of international strategic, military and economic importance, with both Arctic and non-Arctic states expressing a variety of interests in the region's potential.
- Steady increases in domestic and foreign-based tourism, scientific research and commercial activities are being experienced in the Canadian and circumpolar Arctic.
- There is also increased vessel traffic through the various waterways commonly referred to as the ""Northwest Passage,"" which is part of Canada's internal waters.
The relationship between the land and these waterways is unique in Canada's north. For thousands of years, the Inuit have lived on; traveled across; and hunted, fished and trapped in the Canadian Arctic, making no distinction between the frozen land and the frozen sea. These practices continue and remain vital to Inuit culture and the Inuit economy today.
In today's increasingly complex Arctic and northern environment, the continued safety and security of the North depends on strengthened emergency management and community safety, including the enhanced presence and ability to respond of security providers, such as the:
- Canadian Armed Forces
- Royal Canadian Mounted Police
- Canadian Border Services AgencyFootnote 7
Strengthened emergency management requires a coordinated strategy, including enhanced participation of Indigenous representatives; this will be essential in building community resilience and capacity against emergencies and natural disasters.
Northern communities experience multiple risk factors and other challenges that affect their ability to respond to crime issues, such as remote geographical location and limited capacity. Culturally-sensitive crime prevention and community safety planning initiatives build knowledge and capacity that are required in order to support healthy, safe and stronger communities.
Improved situational awareness, including through NORAD and the Maritime Security Operations Centres, will also be key to protecting our north now and into the future. In this context, Canada will:
- continue to demonstrate its sovereignty
- defend North America from conventional and advanced military threats
- protect the integrity and sustainability of our northern economy, environment and critical infrastructure
- ensure a safe and secure transportation system
- safeguard the technological advantage that the Canadian Armed Forces rely on to defend our north
- effectively manage border security
- enhance the ability of the Canadian Coast Guard to help provide partners with essential Maritime Domain Awareness
- support the safety and prosperity of northern peoples and communities
Collaboration among all levels of government, with Indigenous and northern peoples and communities, and with international allies and partners, will be important.
Goal 7 objectives
- Strengthen Canada's cooperation and collaboration with domestic and international partners on safety, security and defence issues
- Enhance Canada's military presence as well as prevent and respond to safety and security incidents in the Arctic and the North
- Strengthen Canada's domain awareness, surveillance and control capabilities in the Arctic and the North
- Enforce Canada's legislative and regulatory frameworks that govern transportation, border integrity and environmental protection in the Arctic and the North
- Increase the whole-of-society emergency management capabilities in Arctic and northern communities
- Support community safety through effective and culturally-appropriate crime prevention initiatives and policing services
Goal 8: Reconciliation supports self-determination and nurtures mutually respectful relationships between Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples
In its final report, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada describes reconciliation as ""establishing and maintaining a mutually respectful relationship between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal peoples in this country. In order for that to happen, there has to be awareness of the past, acknowledgement of the harm that has been inflicted, atonement for the causes and action to change behaviour.""
The Qikiqtani Truth Commission based in Nunavut also called for a new relationship between government and Qikiqtani Inuit grounded in ""awareness and acknowledgement of past wrongs, and commitment on both sides to collaborate in building a better future."" In recent years, the Government of Canada has publicly recognized the negative impacts of its past policies upon Indigenous peoples, for instance through the:
- Statement of Apology to Former Students of Indian Residential Schools in 2008)
- Apology for the Inuit High Arctic relocation in 2010
- Statement of Apology on Behalf of the Government of Canada to Former Students of the Newfoundland and Labrador Residential Schools in 2017
The Government of Canada will continue to redress past wrongs, acknowledge harm and raise awareness. The government is also working to take actions to improve and renew relationships with Indigenous peoples through distinctions-based approaches that respect the unique rights, interests and circumstances of Inuit, First Nations and Métis peoples. The Government of Canada is moving towards the recognition and implementation of rights as the basis for Canada's relationship with Inuit First Nations and Métis. Canada has also committed to exploring new ways of working together, including through the Inuit-Crown Partnership and the other permanent bilateral mechanisms formed to jointly advance shared priorities.
The improvement and devolution of governance to give all people in Canada's Arctic and north more control over their lives will underpin reconciliation, build long-term capacity and contribute to the building of healthier and more resilient communities. The vast majority of Indigenous self-governments are found in the north. Innovative approaches to self-determination have also been established through public governments.
One of the roles of the federal government is to advance self-determination for Canada's Arctic and northern residents, including the devolution of province-like powers to territorial governments. This helps enable a locally-based approach to reconciliation, to be undertaken together by the peoples of the Arctic and north.
In addition to the recognition of rights and innovative forms of governance and collaboration, reconciliation in Canada's Arctic and north means closing the socio-economic gaps that exist between Arctic and northern Indigenous peoples and other Canadians. Canada will work with Indigenous governments and organizations, territories, provinces and other partners to close these gaps. This will be achieved, in part, through the implementation of the:
- Calls to Action of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada
- United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples
- goals and objectives articulated in this framework
Goal 8 objectives
- Honour, uphold and implement the rights of Arctic and northern Indigenous peoples, including those outlined in historic and modern treaties and in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples
- Change federal operating practices and processes in support of increased self-determination and representation of Arctic and northern Indigenous peoples, and recognize the unique operating environment of various Indigenous and public governments in the Arctic and north
- Ensure that Arctic and northern Indigenous peoples have the opportunity, choice and capacity to enter into treaties, agreements and other constructive arrangements with the Crown that provide a foundation for ongoing relations
- Reclaim, revitalize, maintain and strengthen the cultures of Arctic and Northern Indigenous peoples, including their languages and knowledge systems
- Complete outstanding devolution commitments, including the devolution of land, inland waters and resource management in Nunavut
- Work with Indigenous governments and organizations, provinces, territories and other partners to close socioeconomic gaps between Arctic and northern Indigenous peoples and other Canadians
- Continue to redress past wrongs against Indigenous peoples
Conclusion: Next steps
The development of this framework has strengthened collaborative relationships between framework partners and among federal government departments. This development of new ways of working together is, in itself, a significant achievement.
In the second phase of the framework, governance mechanisms will be co-developed through discussions among framework partners, the governments and Indigenous peoples' organizations that worked together on the first part of the framework. These mechanisms will describe how partners will regularly collaborate to share information and assess progress on framework implementation, building on significant developments in governance over the last 50 years. Governance mechanisms will:
- support the jurisdictional and institutional landscape created by devolution, modern treaties and land claim and self-government agreements
- adhere to the principles of partnership articulated in A New Shared Arctic Leadership Model, the final report of Mary Simon, the Minister's Special Representative on Arctic Leadership
- meet partners' expectations for meaningful, ongoing involvement in policy decisions related to their interests
- provide a forum for all partners to be regularly convened for collaborative discussions on implementation of the framework
- commit to reconciliation in the context of renewed federal-provincial-territorial-Indigenous relationships
- ensure that existing fora, such as the Inuit Crown Partnership Committee, the Yukon Forum, and the Intergovernmental Council of the Northwest Territories, are leveraged to assist in implementation
- reflect the authorities and powers of territorial, provincial and Indigenous governments
Financial investment in the framework will be an integral element of its success. Partners will work together to develop an implementation and investment plan. The plan will outline how new investments together with other economic and regulatory levers will be used to contribute to implementation of the framework.
The implementation and investment plan will:
- define new investments
- provide information on how partners' funding initiatives are aligned with and supportive of the goals and objectives described in the ANPF policy statement, including in partner chapters
- provide strategic alignment and flexibility of investments to accommodate the unique nature of 'doing business' in the Arctic and north
- define indicators, data collection and reporting commitments related to specific funding and initiatives
Annex: Principles for the Arctic and Northern Policy Framework
The principles below were developed to provide continuing guidance on implementation of the framework.
- Decisions about the Arctic and the North will be made in partnership with and with the participation of northerners, to reflect the rights, needs and perspectives of northerners
- The rights and jurisdictions of Canada's federal, territorial, provincial Indigenous and municipal governments will be respected
- Development should be sustainable and holistic, integrating social, cultural, economic and environmental considerations
- Ongoing reconciliation with Indigenous peoples, using the work of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission as a starting point, is foundational to success
- As climate change is a lived reality in the region, initiatives will take into account its various impacts, including its impact on Indigenous northerners, who continue to rely on the land and wildlife for their culture, traditional economy, and food security
- Policy and programming will reflect a commitment to diversity and equality, and to the employment of analytical tools such as Gender-Based Analysis Plus to assess potential impacts on diverse groups of people
- The framework will respect a distinctions-based approach to ensure that the unique rights, interests and circumstances of Inuit, Arctic and northern First Nations and Métis are acknowledged, affirmed and implemented
- The Government of Canada recognizes Inuit, First Nations, and Métis as the Indigenous peoples of Canada, consisting of distinct, rights-bearing communities with their own histories, including with the CrownThe work of forming renewed relationships based on the recognition of rights, respect, co-operation and partnership must reflect the unique interests, priorities and circumstances of each people
- Every sector of society, from the private sector to universities and colleges, the not-for-profit sector, community-based organizations and individual Canadians, has an important part to play in building a strong Canadian Arctic and North.
Introduction to partners' chapters
The content in the Arctic and Northern Policy Framework was discussed over the course of more than a year by the partners in the co-development process. The ideas, the aspirations, and the goals and objectives are the result of the meeting of many minds and perspectives. This often meant compromise on the part of governments and Indigenous partners as we strove for consensus. As part of the development of the framework, we decided it was important for partners to be able to express themselves directly, to lay out their visions, aspirations and priorities. While the framework chapters are an integral part of this process, they do not necessarily reflect the views of either the federal government, or of the other partners.

Learn about the ways WWF works to conserve a future where people live in harmony with nature.","The Arctic fox is primarily a carnivore that lives inland, away from the coasts. They are dependent on the presence of smaller animals (most often lemmings) to survive. Arctic foxes also hunt for sea birds, fish, and other marine life. Smaller rodent populations waver between times of abundance and scarcity, which leaves the Arctic fox vulnerable when these creatures are low in numbers.
Temperatures in the Arctic are rising at twice the rate of the rest of the world. Warming temperatures are linked to many changes in the Arctic, including reduced sea ice, melting permafrost and rising sea levels.
Hunting
The Arctic fox was impacted tremendously by the fur trade because of its extremely high quality pelt. It's still hunted now for its fur, particularly by native populations who live in close proximity to them. The fur trade has decreased dramatically and the Arctic fox is not as vulnerable to overexploitation as it once was.
What WWF Is Doing
WWF works to make sure fragile ecosystems are supported and protected. We mitigate the effects of climate change to ensure the survival of the Arctic fox and other species.

As part of the Commonwealth of the Realm of Denmark DMI has a long tradition studying, monitoring and forecasting Greenland’s weather, atmosphere, ocean, ice and climate. Further, climate change is more pronounced in the Arctic than almost everywhere else on the globe. It is therefore important to assess potential future Arctic changes using climate models.
Many lines of research at the DMI are centered around the Arctic. DMI is responsible for forecasting the weather, ocean , ice and wave conditions for Greenland, and thus runs numerical weather, ocean-ice and wave prediction models for Greenland and provides official forecasts. DMI participates in a number of climate studies in the Arctic, including coupled atmosphere -ice sheet modelling as well as ocean and sea ice studies with focus on Greenland fjords, the surrounding waters and the Arctic Ocean.
Atmosphere and ocean climate models are run over numerous Arctic domains and coupled atmosphere, ocean, ice sheet and permafrost models are developed. The arctic stratosphere, which is determining for the ozone layer over the Northern Hemisphere, is a long-standing research area at DMI. Finally, DMI researchers are part of the team behind the outreach web site polarportal.org and take part in several expert groups on short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs) in the Arctic.
Increasing economic activities in the Arctic waters such as maritime transport, offshore oil and gas exploitation and fishery have raised new research challenges such as e-navigation, environmental protection and ice service. Combing modeling, remote sensing and in-situ monitoring, DMI has been actively developing integrated Arctic System science for serving a variety of social benefit areas.

ice2ice (Link: coming up. See introduction video)
Project aims: ice2ice is the first concerted effort to the tackle question of the cause and future implications of past abrupt climate change in Greenland, the main hypothesis being that the Arctic and sub-Arctic sea ice cover excerts important controls on past and future Greenland temperature and ice sheet variations. In ice2ice this will be done by:
- describing the nature, timing and wxtent of abrupt events across climate archives,
- resolving mechanisms behind the sudden demise of sea ice cover,
- identifying the risk that the ongoing rapid diminution of Arctic sea ice cover could give abrupt GIS changes in the future,
- determining the impacts of such changes for the GIS and Arctic and global climate.
DMI's role: To further develop and apply global and regional Earth system models to be able to conduct experiments addressing the central question of the project. This involves, high resolution atmosphere modeling, a coupled high resolution regional climate model for the Arctic and using the global EC-Earth model. In most cases with an interactive ice sheet model (PISM) being part of the system. 3 PhD positions will form a central contribution to the project, but substantial funding is allocated to permanent staff at DMI.

SAMAR - Short and long term ablation modelling based on Automatic Weather Station data and Regional Climate Model
Project aims: The overall goal of the project SAMAR is to improve predictive capabilities of surface energy balance (SEB) models both on short time scales (days and weeks), that are useful for example for operation of hydroelectric power plants and for making flood warnings, and on century time scale for improved projections of the contribution of glaciers to sea level rise. To achieve this overall goal we will take advantage of the wealth of data available in Iceland at IES, and three types of ablation models with various spatial extent and resolution. An SEB model that has been applied for points will be extended to a distributed surface module in HIRHAM5. To include the response of the glacier to the changes in the SEB, HIRHAM5 is coupled to the dynamic ice sheet model PISM for future projections. The objectives of the project are defined as follows:
Objective 1: Develop a distributed SEB model for Icelandic glaciers
Objective 2: Assess the sensitivity of the modelled ablation to variation in albedo and other energy balance components in the model
Objective 3: Validate the SEB module of HIRHAM5 with available observations from AWS and contribute to further development of this module
Objective 4: Validate and apply the coupled HIRHAM5-PISM model on Icelandic glaciers on both short and long time scales as well as with different spatial model resolutions
DMI’s role: Improved parameterisation of SEB in HIRHAM and apply the model to Icelandic glaciers using the PISM Ice Sheet model coupled to HIRHAM

First, the Arctic is already changing rapidly as a result of climate change. Contemporary warm Arctic temperatures and large sea ice deficits (75% volume loss) demonstrate climate states outside of previous experience. Modeled changes of the Arctic cryosphere demonstrate that even limiting global temperature increases to near 2 °C will leave the Arctic a much different environment by mid-century with less snow and sea ice, melted permafrost, altered ecosystems, and a projected annual mean Arctic temperature increase of +4 °C. Second, even under ambitious emission reduction scenarios, high-latitude land ice melt, including Greenland, are foreseen to continue due to internal lags, leading to accelerating global sea level rise throughout the century. Third, future Arctic changes may in turn impact lower latitudes through tundra greenhouse gas release and shifts in ocean and atmospheric circulation. Arctic-specific radiative and heat storage feedbacks may become an obstacle to achieving a stabilized global climate. In light of these trends, the precautionary principle calls for early adaptation and mitigation actions.",,Jamesoverlanda,,,2020-10-19,ScienceDirect

What's At Stake
One of the last unspoiled wild places on earth is at risk of being opened up to oil drilling.
Gray wolves, musk oxen, caribou, and imperiled polar bears roam the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge’s 19.6 million acres. Migratory birds visit from all 50 states and six continents. These lands—first recognized with federal protections 60 years ago—are vital to the culture and survival of the indigenous Gwich’in people, who have relied on the Arctic Refuge for thousands of years.
But in a move that will hasten climate change and have devastating consequences for people, wildlife, and pristine public lands, the Trump administration pushed a reckless plan to begin oil and gas lease sales within the refuge’s coastal plain—an area that the Gwich’in have called “the sacred place where life begins.” At the same time, the administration moved to allow dangerous seismic testing on the coastal plain. Seismic testing would be incredibly destructive to wildlife—taking place in critical habitat for polar bears, right in the middle of denning season—and the fragile landscape.
NRDC has been calling for nationwide opposition and helping to lead the charge against this assault on the refuge, as well as other attempts to drill and destroy public lands and waters in the Arctic region. we will work with Indigenous leaders and the Biden administration to fully protect these lands. The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is the last place for oil and gas drilling.

On average, the temperature on the Earth’s surface has increased by 0.6°C (1°F) over the last two centuries.*1 Most of the warming observed in the past 50 years is attributed to human activities and particularly to the burning of fossil fuels.
Information on past climatic conditions obtained from ice cores and other sources shows that the current increase in global temperatures goes beyond natural climate variability. In the Arctic, average temperatures have risen almost twice as fast as in the rest of the world and climate changes are particularly intense. Changes in the Arctic climate will also affect the rest of the world through increased global warming and rising sea levels. More...
1.2 The Arctic region is the area around the North Pole, essentially an ocean surrounded by land. In the far north, the Arctic is mostly covered by snow and ice, whereas the southernmost part is covered by boreal forests. In between, there is a wide expanse of tundra. The Arctic is home to an array of plants, animals, and people that survive in some of the most extreme conditions on the planet and that are uniquely adapted to such conditions. Climate change, pollution, and growing resource use are factors that put an increasing pressure on fragile Arctic populations and ecosystems. More...
1.3 The Arctic region is home to almost four million people, including an increasing majority of non-indigenous settlers. The Arctic includes Greenland, Iceland, and the northern parts of Norway, Sweden, Finland, Canada, Russia, and the United States. Economically, the region depends largely on natural resources, ranging from oil, gas, and metal ores to fish, reindeer and birds. Recently, the tourism sector has also grown in many parts of the Arctic. More...
2.1 Evidence of the recent warming of the Arctic is provided by: records of increasing temperatures; melting glaciers, sea ice, and permafrost; and rising sea levels. More...
2.2 Global temperatures are expected to increase further during the 21st century. In the Arctic, this warming is expected to be substantially greater than the global average, and the following changes are expected over the current century* :
The average annual temperatures are projected to rise by 3 to 7 °C (5 to 13°F), with the greatest warming occurring in the winter months
Precipitation is projected to increase by roughly 20%.
Sea ice is expected to continue to decline significantly, reflecting less solar radiation and thereby increasing regional and global warming.
The area of Arctic land covered by snow is expected to decrease by 10 to 20%.
These projections assume a gradual warming. However, abrupt and unexpected changes cannot be ruled out. More...
3.4 By 2100, melting of Arctic glaciers alone will have contributed to a sea level rise of roughly 5 cm out of the projected 10-90cm total rise for this century.*2 Melting of the Greenland ice sheet may increase this number significantly. More...
3.5 Access to Arctic resources is likely to be affected by climate change, including: wildlife, such as whales, seals, birds, and fish sold on world markets; and oil, gas and mineral reserves.
Arctic ecosystem changes will have an impact on a global scale, notably by affecting migratory species’ summer breeding and feeding grounds. More...
4.1 The Arctic region has three main types of vegetation: polar deserts in the north, boreal forests in the south, and tundra in between. Rising temperatures are expected to favor a northward expansion of boreal forest into the tundra, and of tundra into the polar desert. More...
4.2 The expansion of forest is likely to amplify global warming, because the newly forested areas are darker than the tundra they replace, and absorb more of the sun’s energy. However, this can be somewhat counterbalanced by the fact that they also take up more carbon from the atmosphere. More...
Forest fires could become more frequent
4.3 Due to the warming, insect outbreaks will increasingly disturb large areas of forest. Most scenarios project more forest fires in all ecosystems. More...
4.4 Climate change is expected to increase the range of crops that can be grown in the Arctic and to extend the growing season. However, problems caused by insects, diseases, and weeds are likely to worsen. More...
5.1 Many Arctic animals, such as polar bears, seals, walruses, and seabirds, rely on the sea’s biological productivity and on the presence of sea ice, both of which are highly dependent on climatic conditions. More...
5.2 Changes in sea surface temperatures or currents could have a strong effect on Arctic marine fish stocks, which are an important food source for the world and play a vital role in the region’s economy. More...
5.3 Rising temperatures could have both positive and negative impacts on the aquaculture of salmon and trout, which is a major industry in the Arctic. More...
5.4 A decline in certain types of vegetation would affect the animals that feed on them (such as lemmings or reindeers). In turn, predators (such as foxes or birds of prey) and human communities that depend on these animals would be affected. More...
5.5 Freshwaterecosystems, such as rivers, lakes, and wetlands are home to a variety of animals. They would be affected by increases in water temperature, thawing of permanently frozen ground, and ice cover breaking up earlier in spring. More...
6. How will settlements and infrastructures be affected by Arctic warming?
Coastal communities face increasing exposure to storms
6.1 Many coastal communities and facilities face increasing exposure to storms.
Rising temperatures are modifying the Arctic coastline and are expected to change it even more in the future. Sea level rise is likely to cause flooding of marshes and coastal plains and accelerate beach erosion. Some towns and industrial facilities are already suffering severe damage as a result of erosion, and are now facing the prospect of relocation. More...
6.2 Reduced sea ice is very likely to increase marine transport and access to resources.
A further decline in the area of Arctic sea-ice will extend the navigation period and allow better accessibility by ship around the Arctic Basin and probably open new shipping routes. More...
6.3 Thawing ground will disrupt transportation, buildings, and other infrastructure
The melting of the permafrost layer poses significant engineering challenges for roads, buildings, pipelines, and industrial facilities. New construction will require deeper foundations, thicker insulation, and other preventive measures that will increase construction costs. More...
7. How will people and their environment be affected by Arctic warming?
7.1 Indigenous communities are facing major economic and cultural impacts.
The many indigenous communities whose cultures and activities are shaped by the Arctic environment are facing new challenges because of climate change, in addition to those posed by current social, economic, and political conditions. They find weather less stable and predictable, and are affected by changes in snow and sea ice. More...
7.2 Elevated ultraviolet radiation levels will affect people, plants, and animals.
The increase of ultraviolet (UV) radiation reaching the Earth’s surface as a result of the thinning of the ozone layer has negative effects on humans, animals and plants in the Arctic, particularly in the spring when living organisms are most vulnerable. More...
Rovaniemi, capital of Finnish Lapland, one of the largest cities north of the Arctic Circle
7.3 Multiple influences interact to cause impacts to people and ecosystems.
The ability of the Arctic populations to cope with the impacts of climate change will be greatly affected by political, legal, and socioeconomic factors such as growing populations, urbanization, or self-determination movements. More...
8. What changes are expected in specific areas of the Arctic?
In a region as large as the Arctic, there are significant sub-regional variations in climate. Recent warming has been more dramatic in some regions than in others. Moreover, local features of the natural world and societies create differences in what impacts will occur and which will be most significant locally.
The Arctic Climate Impact Assessment (ACIA) focuses on four sub-regions and considers a series of key impacts:
impacts on the environment, such as changes in habitats and in the geographic spread of plant and animal species,
impacts on the economy, such as changes in access to resources, and
impacts on people’s lives, such as effects on traditional lifestyles or damage to infrastructure.
The Arctic Climate Impact Assessment (ACIA) represents the first effort to comprehensively examine climate change and its impacts in the Arctic region, bringing together the findings of hundreds of scientists and the insights of indigenous people.
There remain important gaps in knowledge that will require improved long-term monitoring, studies of ecosystem processes, climate modeling, as well as analysis of impacts on society. The International Polar Year (in 2007-2009) will be an opportunity to improve our understanding of the impacts of climate change. More...
Climate change presents a major and growing challenge to the Arctic and the world as a whole. Implications are particularly great for future generations that will face the consequences of current action or inaction.
10.1 Resulting environmental changes will present risks as well as opportunities across the Arctic. For example, the large reduction in summer sea ice threatens the future of several ice-dependent species but will also increase marine access to resources and population centers. More...
10.2 The scenarios used in this assessment assume that changes will be gradual. However, because of the complexity of the Earth’s climatic system, major surprises are possible if climate evolves differently. Ocean currents, in the North Atlantic might undergo major changes with wide-ranging consequences for climate. More...
10.3 Impacts of changing climate in the Arctic are already being widely observed and felt. They provide an early indication for the rest of the world of the significance of climate change. The changes will also reach far beyond the Arctic, affecting global climate, sea level, biodiversity, and many aspects of social and economic systems. Climate change in the Arctic thus deserves and requires urgent attention by decision makers and the public worldwide. More...

Through outreach activities and with competent and committed partners on arctic issues, Arctic Frontiers sets the agenda, linking policy, business and science for responsible and sustainable development of the Arctic. The main premise behind Arctic Frontiers is to couple academia with decision makers from government and business. The Arctic Frontiers partnership network consists of some of the world’s leading actors in the Arctic. The competence and interdisciplinarity of the partner network is unique in both national and international contexts.
The Arctic’s role is changing. From being a cold periphery, the region is increasingly playing a role at the centre on the geopolitical stage. With vast energy and marine resources, the region is on the agenda of industrial, political and societal organisations across the globe. Increased human activity in the Arctic will have significant economic, political, and social implications for Arctic nations and will influence the Arctic environment. Arctic Frontiers discusses the political frameworks needed to utilise these opportunities in a responsible way.
Arctic Frontiers 2021
Arctic Frontiers started out in 2006 assembling the first global scientific conference on economic, societal and environmental sustainable growth in the north. In February 2021, we will arrange the 15th conference with the theme “Building Bridges”. The conference has a pan arctic perspective and builds new partnerships across nations, generations and ethnic groups. Arctic Frontiers provides a forum for dialogue and communication between science, government and industry in the Arctic.
Year round activities
In between the annual conferences, the Arctic Frontiers secretariat works together with the partners with all the five pillars that Arctic Frontiers is founded upon; Policy, Business, Science, Arena and Young. Through seminars, open debates, workshops, projects and network meetings both in Norway and abroad, Arctic Frontiers sets the agenda and advocates a responsible knowledge-based growth and development in the Arctic.

Clark is stunned that ""Kara"" would go to Lex but it is revealed that Brainiac is impersonating Kara and that she's actually trapped in the Phantom Zone. Chloe is arrested by the Department of Domestic Security and Lana awakens from her comatose state. Meanwhile, in an epic turn of events, Clark and Lex face off in the Fortress and Lex learns Clark's secret.
Recap
→ see also Category:Screencaps from episode 7x20
Edward Teague is on a private jet when the flight attendant approaches him. It is Kara Kent beginning to question him about Veritas and a device. He avoids her questions and she grabs him by the neck and punches a hole in the side of the plane. She threatens to throw him out, until he admits that Lex Luthor probably has the information she seeks. Kara flies out of the plane, destroying the tail and causing it to crash.
Lex is in his Daily Planet office when he is informed that two of his teams have gone missing trying to reach their target in the Arctic Circle. Jimmy Olsen enters and thinks he is meeting Lex about his upcoming Kawatche Caves article. However, Lex reminds him that he did Jimmy a favor by calling the Department of Domestic Security and keeping Chloe Sullivan out of prison so he wants Jimmy to distract Lois Lane, who has been asking too many questions about him. Jimmy is reluctant because Lois is quite persistent but Lex has forced his hand. He gives him bogus satellite images to throw Lois off the trail.
Clark Kent answers his door to find Lois eager to see him. She explains that since Chloe was fired, a spot has opened up in the bullpen. She gives him an application and says she thinks he is destined for greater things than working on a farm. Clark points out that he would never work for Lex and Lois asks why they were ever such great friends. Clark just says that sometimes people don't turn out the way you think they will. He warns Lois to be careful working for Lex. Chloe arrives and asks to talk to Clark in private. Lois exits and Chloe informs Clark that Teague has just died in a plane crash.
Clark and Chloe go to the Isis Foundation where she explains that she has hacked into the plane's black box and learned details about the crash. She plays garbled audio and Clark uses his super hearing and is surprised to hear Kara's voice, threatening to bring the plane down. They wonder if Kara is as dangerous as other Kryptonians they have come in contact with but Clark is reluctant to believe that Kara is a killer. Chloe plays more audio and Clark hears that she is going after Lex.
Kara arrives in the Luthor Mansion and uses her X-ray vision to locate the orb in Lex's safe. However, there is a fail-safe protection within the orb, preventing anyone other than a human from using the device, which means she is unable to take it for herself. Clark finds Kara and asks her about the plane crash. Kara says she was only trying to protect him and killed Teague for going after Clark. He grabs her and speeds her back to the barn. He questions her strange behavior, suggesting she has come into contact with red kryptonite or has changed on returning from the past. Kara insists that she is fine. She tells Clark that if someone figured out how to control him, a lot more innocent people might die, and that she is going to do whatever it takes to save Earth. She flies away and when Clark tries to hold her back, she kicks him across the barn and departs.
Jimmy meets Lois at the Ace of Clubs and gives her the satellite images. He convinces her that Lex has been visiting the Arctic looking for new places to drill oil. Lois is skeptical but Jimmy says he got the photos from the photo lab and Lois seems convinced.
Lex finds Kara in his library, and she begins to ask him questions about Veritas. She tells him that she wants the device that can control the Traveler. She says she and the Traveler are from the same planet and demonstrates for Lex by using her heat vision. Lex realizes that Kara is in fact the being that saved him at Reeves Dam. Kara tells him that she saved him because it is his destiny to defeat the Traveler. She says the device is designed so that only a human can use it. She tells him to take the device to the co-ordinates in the Arctic and that she will help him find it. Lex doesn't understand why Kara would help destroy one of her own kind but Kara claims that she knows the Traveler's true destiny: to destroy mankind. Lex asks who the Traveler is, and Kara suggests that he already knows.
Chloe finds Clark at home with the lead box. He tells her that kryptonite is the only way to stop Kara. He is worried that Kara is right: that he hasn't done all he could to stop Veritas. He asks Chloe to help stop Kara but Chloe points out that the green kryptonite will incapacitate him as well, and that she should do it alone.
Lex is preparing to take the device to the Arctic and tells his men that another passenger is coming. Jimmy arrives and tells him that he did what Lex asked and gave Lois the photos. He thinks they are even now but Lex tells him to continue to spy on Lois. Jimmy objects, saying he does not want to lie anymore. He promises not to tell anyone about Lex's secrets and is pleased with himself when Lex seems to agree.
Chloe lures Kara to her apartment, but is shocked when the green K does not work. Kara realizes that Chloe has deceived her, prompting Chloe to try and escape the apartment. Kara blocks the door and reveals that 'she' is actually Brainiac impersonating Kara. Changing back into Milton Fine, he tells Chloe he is impressed that she tried to stop him. He attempts to pierce her head with his finger tendrils, but Chloe's power enables her to resist him. By the time she falls to the ground, Brainiac is considerably weakened and unable to continue his attack. Lex boards his jet and decides not to wait for Kara, being uncertain if he can trust her. The security team is reluctant to leave, since his last two teams have disappeared, but Lex is convinced that the device will protect him.
Clark visits Chloe in the hospital, sits by her side, and apologizes. Suddenly her eyes open; they are clouded over, and Clark realizes that she has been attacked by Brainiac. Brainiac is out seeking high voltage lines to recharge himself when Clark arrives and apprehends him. Clark now realizes that the real Kara never came back from Krypton, with Brainiac admitting that he was already impersonating her, having overcome Kara when they were out of Clark's sight. When Clark asks if he killed Kara, Brainiac says it is much worse than that. In a rage, Clark attacks him and demands that he release Chloe and Lana Lang. Brainiac points out that Clark would never kill him, as he needs to do to release them, because it is against his nature. But, in a defining moment, Clark retorts that Brainiac is not a man, but a machine, and using the nearby power supplies, electrocutes him until he explodes.
Kara is now seen trapped in the Phantom Zone, with the young Kryptonian spinning through space in one of the Phantom 'prison discs'.
Clark confirms that Chloe is okay as he goes to visit Lana. However, he is shocked to find her room in the hospital empty. The nurse explains that she made a sudden and miraculous recovery and checked out and has left Clark a DVD. Back at the farm, Clark watches the video, in which Lana explains that she felt unable to tell him in person. She says they were fooling themselves by thinking they were meant to be together. She says the world needs him more than she does. She tells him she loves him more than he will ever know, but asks Clark not to look for her. Lois arrives just as the video is ending. Clark starts to cry and she gives him a comforting hug.
Jimmy brings Chloe home from the hospital. He is very nervous and admits that when Chloe was in the hospital he realized how much she means to him. He gives her a plastic ring and proposes. Before she can answer, armed agents from the Department of Domestic Security storm into the Talon and place Chloe under arrest. Jimmy tries to protest, but they punch him to the ground. As they are hauling her off, Chloe screams for Jimmy to call Clark. Jimmy finds Clark in his loft and tells him Chloe got arrested. Jimmy admits that he made a deal with Lex, but backed out of it, and says that Lex is now headed to the Arctic Circle.
Lex is in the Fortress of Solitude and is about to place the orb into the glowing console. Clark makes it to the Fortress where Lex is waiting. They stare each other down. The orb glows in Lex's hand. Lex says that Clark has brilliantly been disguising himself as a mild-mannered farm boy, but is secretly plotting mankind's demise. Clark protests, saying he has never hurt Lex. Lex counters that Clark never trusted him, and that they could have worked together to enable Clark to become a hero. Clark says Lex has no right to control his life, but Lex believes that it is his birthright to save mankind, and that all of his suffering has led him to this point. Then, saying ""You'll never threaten the world again—Kal-El"", Lex places the orb into the console where it glows brightly and precipitates the breaking apart of the Fortress. Clark falls to the ground, and Lex kneels down and holds him and tells him that he'd loved him like a brother. The Fortress collapses around them.

Title
- Arctic refers or pertains to the location of the North Pole (the Arctic Region).
- The title refers to the setting of the showdown between Clark and Lex set in the Arctic; in the Fortress of Solitude. The Fortress of Solitude is located in the Arctic Circle.
Notes
- Antagonists: Lex Luthor and Brainiac
- Clark’s Abilities: Super-Hearing, Super-Speed, Invulnerability
- Brainiac’s Abilities: Shape-Shifting, Super-Strength, Super-Breathing, Invulnerability, Flight, X-Ray Vision, Heat Vision, Electricity Absorption
- Lex tells Brainiac/Kara about his belief that it was Kara who saved him at Reeves Dam in Bizarro and Brainiac says ""I saved you for a reason"" to convince Lex that it is his destiny to help him, by using the orb to defeat Clark whose destiny is to destroy mankind.
- Promotional images for this episode showed Lex in snow gear approaching the Fortress, which had been shot for the ending of Veritas before the season resumed filming from the writers' strike. That image and footage was scrapped in favor of newer footage with Lex dressed in a manner reminiscent of his coat in Season Five's Vessel and Season Six's Zod.
- Brainiac absorbed energy from an electric power station in order to recover is similar to Sean Kelvin absorbing heat energy in Season One's Cool.
- Lana's video letter where she describes how the world needs him more than she does to Clark bears a striking resemblance to a letter in the comics that adult Lana left for Superman, describing how she wishes they could have spent their life in a bubble away from the world.[1] Lana also made a video break-up message for her high school boyfriend while he was away at war.
- This is the second season finale that features James Marsters as Brainiac (after Season Five's Vessel) and the third that features the character Brainiac (after Season Five's Vessel and Season Four's Commencement).
- It possible that Lex remembered the name Kal-El from the Disciples of Zod in Season Five's Arrival.
- This finale is the third one where a main character discovers Clark secret of being an alien. In this case, it's Lex while the previous two were Lana in Season Six's Phantom and Lex in Season Five's Vessel.
- This is the third season finale to feature all but one main character with Lionel Luthor in this season, Pete Ross in Season Three's Covenant and Jonathan Kent in Season Five's Vessel.
- This is the first season finale that doesn't feature Lionel Luthor or Martha Kent.
Trivia
- This is the last episode in which Michael Rosenbaum (Lex), Laura Vandervoort (Kara), and Kristin Kreuk (Lana) are series regulars.[2][3][4]
- Although Lionel died four episodes prior, this episode is the last one where John Glover is credited as a series regular.
- Laura Vandervoort portrays Brainiac posing as Kara in this episode. In Supergirl, Vandervoort guest-stars as the DC Comics character Indigo, later revealed to be Brainiac 8.
Deleted Scenes
- This episode has three unaired scenes on the Season 7 DVDs.In the first, it is revealed that Lana became uncontrollably violent during her catatonia at least once, but Clark is able to plead with her and calm her down.In the other two, Lois and Jimmy are dealing with Chloe's attack, which doctors have presumed was a stroke. Lois is packing to visit Chloe in the hospital and upset with Clark, unaware that he is still trying to track down Brainiac. Jimmy tells Clark that he found her unconscious on the floor. He thinks Chloe's meteor power is the reason for her condition, and is somewhat not surprised that Clark already knew about it. This last scene was somewhat reworked for Season Eight's Abyss, where Jimmy reveals to Clark that he thinks Chloe's meteor infection is making her sick, but realizes Clark already knows about it.
Continuity
- This is the sixth time Lex has discovered Clark's secret. He forgot about Clark's powers in Season One's Hug (after being influenced by Bob Rickman), in Season Three's Shattered (due to electroshock therapy), and in Season Four's Onyx (after black kryptonite merged the good and bad Lex); Lex also discovered Clark's secret in the alternate timeline of Season Five's Reckoning, and Clark dreamed he did in Season Three's Slumber.
- The Kryptonian device Lex uses to destroy the Fortress was found in the fireplace mantle of the Luthor Mansion by Lex in the previous episode Quest.
- After Jor-El sent the Orb to earth, he sent transmissions (the prophecy) which enabled Dr. Virgil Swann to find it. Swann then founded Veritas before hiding the orb and leaving a long line of clues to its whereabouts.
- Clark asks Kara if she's come into contact with red kryptonite. Red K was last seen in Season Six's Crimson.
- When Clark grabs Kara by her legs and she kicks him across the barn, it is similar to their first meeting. In that case, Clark slams her back onto the ground. This may be another hint that this is not the real Kara.
- This is the first time Lana has been ""awake"" since Veritas.
- This is Lana's fourth ""Dear John"" letter. She broke up with Whitney Fordman in Season Two's Heat with another video letter while he was posted overseas. She left Jason Teague a note before abruptly leaving him in Paris in Season Four's Gone.[5] She also wrote Lex a breakup note intending to leave him before their wedding in Season Six's Promise.
- Brainiac says to Chloe, ""I remember you. Always sticking your pretty little head where it doesn't belong,"" referencing when Chloe helped Clark defeat Brainiac in Solitude.
- This is Lana's third time moving away from Smallville, the first was in Season Three's Covenant and the second was in Season Six's Phantom.
- Brainiac says ""If we would have done this my way, no one would have gotten hurt."" He earlier said this to Kara and Clark in the episode Veritas.
- At their final showdown in the Fortress, Clark says to Lex that ""I've never done anything to hurt you."" Apparently, Clark's forgotten the times that he had intentionally hurt Lex in Season Five's Mortal, the time he actually tried to kill him in Season Six's Crimson, or even allowed Lex to get hurt in Siren.
- This is the first episode since Veritas that Lois appears in where she isn't in any physical danger.
- This episode marks the 5th time Clark wears his Red jacket/Blue shirt outfit in a season finale after Season Three's Covenant, Season Four's Commencement, Season Five's Vessel and Season Six's Phantom.
- This episode marks the 75th appearance of Clark's red jacket & blue shirt outfit, which he wears frequently throughout the series.
- Brainiac was last seen in Apocalypse.
- The outfit worn by Chloe in the first part of the episode is later seen again in Hex, when she is transformed into Lois.
Spoilers
- The aftermath of Brainiac's attack on Chloe in this episode was revealed in Season Eight's Odyssey, Toxic and Bloodline: Brainiac infected Chloe's brain to cause almost total amnesia in Abyss and was able to take over her body completely in Legion.
- It is later revealed in Season Eight's Power that Lana was forced by Tess Mercer to make the video for Clark and taken away. She escaped her captors and realized that what she was forced to say in the video was true, so she decide to let Clark go and give him to the world. Lana spent the next seven months training and keeping an eye on Lex to protect Clark , knowing how dangerous he was now that he knew his secret. She also plot against Lex in order to stop him from getting super powers thanks to the Prometheus Suit, that she decide to steal and use to do good in the world.
- The Orb that Lex uses to destroy the Fortress was revealed to be in Tess's possession in Season Eight's Eternal.
- Before his confirmed return in Season Ten's Finale, Part 2, this episode was thought to be Michael Rosenbaum's final episode as Lex.
- Lex's usage of the Orb would have repercussions that would follow during subsequent seasons: Lex's discovery allowed the Orb to fall into the hands of Tess, then Tess is guided into releasing the Orb, and Zod later is ascended into another dimension which ultimately allowed the release of Darkseid.
Locations
Quotes
- Brainiac: This is a simple matter of self-preservation. When I couldn't kill you, I knew I had to control you.
- Clark: I'm in control now. And you will release Chloe! You'll release Lana!
- Brainiac: The only way to save them would be to kill me now, in cold blood. Which goes against everything you stand for. You could never deliberately take another man's life.
- Clark: You're not a man. You're a machine. (electrocutes Brainiac)
- Chloe: (exposes Kara to kryptonite) Why isn't it working?
- Brainiac-as-Kara: Check the expiration date?
- Brainiac: (to Chloe) I'm impressed. I wouldn't have thought a member of your weak-willed species, especially a friend of Kal-El's, could ever use kryptonite against his cousin.
- Lex: (looking at the Fortress) I must admit, Clark. This is a big step up from the barn.
- Clark: It's not what you think, Lex. You don't understand.
- Lex: For the first time, I think I do. You see, you live among us as a mild-mannered farm boy. But secretly, you're a strange visitor from another planet, plotting our demise.
- Clark: That's not what I'm doing at all.
- Lex: It's a brilliant disguise, Clark. You don't even need a mask.
- Clark: I'm not your enemy, Lex. I've never done anything to hurt you.
- Lex: You didn't trust me. With everything you had, with everything you could do, did you ever think about what we could have accomplished together? I would have helped you become a hero.
- Lex: Who am I to turn my back on my fellow man? Especially after you turned your back on me? I'm sorry, Clark. But you are the Traveler. You hold the future of the entire planet in your hands. I'm here to take it back.
- Clark: Lex...
- Lex: You'll never threaten the world again... Kal-El.
- Brainiac-as-Kara: Why is it every time I bring up Veritas, people seem to suffer from sudden amnesia?
- Clark: Have you come into contact with red kryptonite -- a ring, a necklace?
- Brainiac-as-Kara: I stopped wearing jewelry.
- Brainiac-as-Kara: (to Lex) I always thought the Traveler was meant for good, even he thinks he is, but he went home from Krypton and learnt the truth about his fate. He won't save mankind, he will destroy it.

ARCTIC RUBY® OIL
KING OF ALL OMEGAS™
Arctic Ruby® Oil from Calanus finmarchicus, is not only the world’s most powerful marine oil, it’s the world’s purest.
Purity Matters™
Pure Water
Calanus finmarchicus is found in the pristine waters of the North Atlantic, virtually pollutant free.
True Vegetarian
Calanus finmarchicus is a true vegetarian and only eats phytoplankton!
Mostly Oil
The ruby red oil found in Calanus can be as much as 78% of its body weight.
Solvent Free
The oil extraction process is gently done without solvents or harsh chemicals.
Sustainability Matters
Unlike fish oil or krill oil there are no sustainability issues with Arctic Ruby® Oil. Calanus finmarchicus forms one of the world’s largest biomasses with most of it going to yearly spoilage. It renews every year and the harvesting of Arctic Ruby® Oil is strictly limited. There’s simply no chance of over harvesting as is the case with fish oil and krill oil.
Environment Matters
Arctic Ruby® Oil is harvested close to its manufacturing facility in Norway. The same can not be said about fish oil and krill oil. Fish oil is produced all over the world from fish harvested outside of Peru and Chile. Krill is harvested in the Antarctica, and like fish oil, transported long distances for production, causing substantial environmental pollution.

As if the impacts of climate change weren’t enough, big fossil fuel companies have now set their sites on exploiting the oil that lies deep in Arctic waters.

The people and animals that live in the Arctic depend on its unique ecosystem to survive. Yet major companies like Shell and Exxon are making aggressive moves to usher in a new “oil rush” in the Arctic Ocean. In some places it has already begun. Russian oil giant Gazprom has already begun producing small amounts oil from the Arctic in the ocean north of Russia.
Here’s why we can’t let ANY drilling in the Arctic continue.
When We Drill, We Spill
The long history of oil spills around the world has made one thing clear: the only way to prevent an oil spill is to keep oil in the ground.
Fragile Arctic ice and tricky weather conditions make a spill in the region even more likely. In a review of Shell’s plans to drill in the Alaskan Arctic Ocean, the U.S. Department of the Interior found that there’s a 75 percent chance of a major oil spill if an oil company finds oil and produces it. Even though the Department of Interior is taking the Arctic off the table for oil drilling for the next two years, it’s critically important that the region is closed to ALL new oil drilling forever.
How Do You Clean up an Arctic Oil Spill?
No oil company has ever successfully cleaned up a major spill.
In 1989, the Exxon Valdez spilled 11 million gallons of oil into Alaska’s Prince William Sound. Exxon spent $2 billion trying to clean up and recovered less than 7 percent of the oil spilled.
In 2010, the BP Deepwater Horizon blowout spilled up to 200 million barrels into the Gulf of Mexico. Of that, only about 8 percent was recovered or burned off.
Extreme conditions—including icy waves that reach 50 feet—make response in the event of an Arctic spill even more difficult. The nearest response stations to Arctic drilling sites are located thousands of miles away.
Keep It in the Ground
For the sake of the people and animals that call the Arctic home—not to mention the global climate—we must keep offshore oil in the ground for good. There’s no climate-safe future that involves drilling in the Arctic Ocean.
It’s the only way to prevent a devastating spill and end our dependence on fossil fuels.

INTRODUCTION
Plastic pollution is a problem of growing environmental concern, because production rates have increased to 380 million metric tons (MT) year−1 in 2015 (1), and annual waste production is projected to rise to 3.4 billion MT in the next 30 years (2). Many countries still have inefficient waste management and water treatment systems allowing leakage to the environment (3), which is exacerbated by littering behavior. Mismanaged plastic waste could triple from 60 million to 99 million MT in 2015 to 155 to 265 million MT by 2060, assuming a business-as-usual scenario (4). In addition, plastic is designed to be durable. Therefore, it persists in the environment for long periods of time. Thus, it is hardly unexpected that plastic pollutants are ubiquitous and have been reported from environments close to urban centers, terrestrial areas, and freshwater environments, as well as from the shores of remote uninhabited islands, the sea surface, water column, and deep seafloor (5). Plastic pollutants have also reached polar regions including Arctic beaches (6), sea ice (7), water column (8), sea surface (9–12), and the seafloor (13). Under the influence of light, mechanic abrasion, waves, and temperature fluctuations, plastic items fragment into smaller particles and are termed microplastic (MP) when attaining sizes below 5 mm. Unexpectedly, Arctic surface waters turned out to harbor the highest MP concentrations in a global comparison of MP quantities, despite their remoteness (14). In addition, litter quantities have increased significantly on the deep Arctic seafloor over the past 15 years as highlighted in a time-series study (13). This stimulated further research unveiling very high concentrations of MPs in the sediment of the deep Fram Strait (15) and Arctic sea ice (16), prompting the question: “How do all these MPs make it so far to the north?”
One possibility is aerial transport since a yet still limited number of studies found MPs in atmospheric fallout of the cities Dongguan (China) and Tehran (17, 18). In France, MP concentrations in atmospheric fallout increased fivefold after a rain event, indicating that wet deposition could be a pathway of MPs to Earth’s surfaces (19) including the oceans. Despite the limited research on airborne plastics, its importance is obvious given the precautions that have to be taken in studies on MPs to reduce the risk of contamination through airborne MPs (20). Further, airborne MPs represent a hitherto largely neglected route of exposure to humans and wildlife as these particles could be taken up through inhalation (21). Snow is a scavenger for diverse impurities and acts as a filter on the ground by dry deposition (22, 23). Here, we sampled snow deposited on ice floes drifting in Fram Strait and on Svalbard to assess whether atmospheric fallout is a pathway of MPs to the Arctic environment. To enable comparisons with previous studies in the Arctic, harmonized automated Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) imaging analysis was applied (15, 16, 24, 25). The Arctic is still widely conceived as one of the last pristine environments on the globe. To verify this view, we also assessed MP concentrations in snow close to more urban sites in northern Europe (Bremen City, Isle of Heligoland) and the Alps (Davos, Tschuggen, Bavaria) for comparison (Fig. 1).
RESULTS
MPs and microfibers were found in all but one snow samples, ranging from 0.02 × 103 to 154 × 103 N liter−1 and 0.043 × 103 to 10.2 × 103 N liter−1, respectively (Fig. 2 and table S1). MPs accounted for 0 to 88% (mean, 12%) of the filtered particles. The material type of fibers, however, could not be determined because of the applied analysis pipeline. Therefore, fiber numbers comprise both synthetic and natural fibers. Nevertheless, we present fiber concentrations to enable comparison with previously published studies, which reported primarily fibers.
Fiber and MP quantities at different locations
MPs occurred at a mean concentration of 9.8 × 103 N liter−1 (± SE 6.9 × 103 N liter−1) with highest quantities detected in the sample Bavaria 2 (154 × 103 N liter−1), followed by Heligoland 2 (17.6 × 103 N liter−1) and Ice Floe 9 (14.4 × 103 N liter−1) (Fig. 1, A and B, and table S1). Snow from Europe contained significantly more MPs (24.6 ± 18.6 × 103 N liter−1) than samples from ice floes (Mann-Whitney U test: W = 54, P = 0.011). Still, a mean of 1.76 ± 1.58 × 103 N liter−1 is substantial for a secluded location such as the Arctic. Figure 3 illustrates images of MPs and fibers from different locations. Ice Floe 9 had a much higher MP concentration than the other Arctic snow samples, raising concern regarding the potential of contamination during sampling or from the helicopter used. Exclusion of this value decreases the mean to 0.18 ± 0.07 × 103 N liter−1. Still, we think that this high level is unlikely due to contamination as varnish, the main polymer type detected, was not part of the equipment used and also present in high quantities in samples from Ice Floe 3, Bremen, the Alps, and Heligoland, where no helicopter was used. In addition, the sample Ice Floe 9 was taken outside the area likely to be affected by helicopter turbulence. Since the second highest MP abundance was detected on Heligoland at a time of strong winds (18 m s−1; table S2), we tested whether MP abundance was correlated with wind speed but found no significant correlation (Spearman’s rank correlation test: ρ = −0.06, P = 0.80). However, wind direction may have played a role as the strong easterly winds may have transported particles from the neighboring dunes or from the mainland.
The maximum quantities of fibers were detected in snow from Ice Floe 4 (10.2 × 103 N liter−1), followed by Heligoland 2 (2.75 × 103 N liter−1) and Bavaria 3 (2.57 × 103 N liter−1) (Fig. 1, A and B, and table S1). Still, overall, snow from Europe contained significantly more fibers (mean, 1.431 ± 0.325 × 103 N liter−1) than samples from Arctic ice floes (Mann-Whitney U test: W = 96, P = 0.024), which had still a substantial mean (1.38 ± 1.10 × 103 N liter−1) given their remoteness. Again, it could be argued that the exceptionally high fiber numbers from Ice Floe 4 may be due to contamination. Its exclusion would lead to a lower mean (0.28 ± 0.095 × 103 N liter−1). However, we deem this unlikely as Ice Floe samples 5 to 8 were taken on the same large ice floe by the same personnel, so contamination of these samples should be similarly high. There was no significant correlation between fiber abundance and wind speed (Spearman’s rank correlation test: ρ = −0.17, P = 0.45). The abundance of fibers was positively correlated with MP abundance (Spearman’s rank correlation test: ρ = 0.62, P = 0.002).
Size of MPs and fibers
The size of MPs detected ranged between 11 and 475 μm. Eighty percent of all detected MPs were ≤25 μm, and 98% of all particles were <100 μm. Overall, the amount of particles decreased with increasing size (Fig. 2C) with no asymptote reached in the smallest detectable size class. Table S2 comprises the size distribution of individual samples.
The length of fibers ranged between 65 and 14,314 μm. While 97% had a maximum length of 5 mm, 31% were shorter than 500 μm. In general, the fibers show an increasing trend toward shorter lengths but are not saturated in the lowest size class (fig. S1). European fibers were significantly longer compared with those from Arctic snow (Mann-Whitney U test: W = 13,723, P = 0.0001) even if the two largest European fibers (14,314 and 13,704 μm) were excluded. Table S3 includes the size information of individual fibers marked with their region of origin.
Material composition
The highest proportion of MPs in the total natural and synthetic particle load was found in snow from Ice Floe 1 (88%), followed by Bavaria 2 (67%) and Ice Floe 9 (37%) (table S2). There was no significant difference in the proportion of MP particles from European and Arctic snow (Mann-Whitney U test: W = 170, P = 0.59). The composition varied considerably with 19 different polymer types found in total ranging between 2 (Ice Floe 4) and 12 types (Bavaria 2) per sample (Fig. 2D and table S1). The number of polymers per sample was significantly higher in European (mean, 8.63 ± 0.80) compared with Arctic (mean, 5.14 ± 0.79) samples (Mann-Whitney U test: W = 123, P = 0.013). Acrylates/polyurethanes/varnish/lacquer (hereafter varnish) occurred most frequently (17 samples), followed by nitrile rubber (16 samples), polyethylene (PE), polyamide, and rubber type 3 (13; ethylene-propylene-diene rubber). The polymer composition of samples from Europe and the Arctic was significantly different [permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA): pseudo-F = 2.43, P = 0.006]. The dissimilarity in the polymer composition from European and Arctic samples was 67% and caused primarily by much higher abundances of polyamide, varnish, rubber type 3, nitrile rubber, ethylene-vinyl-acetate, and PE in European samples. By contrast, polystyrene, polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polycarbonate, polylactic acid, and polyimide occurred exclusively in Arctic snow.
Other particles
Other particles detected in snow accounted for 22 to 100% of the total particles (table S2) and comprised chitin, charcoal, coal, animal fur, plant fibers, and sand. Except for coal, all of these were significantly more abundant in European snow (Mann-Whitney U test: W = 114, P = 0.0015), which also explains the significant differences found in their composition (PERMANOVA: pseudo-F = 7.75, P = 0.001). Particles assigned to “plant fibers” and “animal fur” contributed most to the 46% dissimilarity [similarity percentage (SIMPER)].
DISCUSSION
This study provides the first data on contamination of snow by MPs. MP concentrations in snow were very high, indicating significant contamination of the atmosphere. During its passage through the atmosphere, snow binds airborne particles and pollutants, which are eventually deposited on Earth’s surfaces, a phenomenon termed “scavenging” (22). Our data show that scavenging represents an important pathway of MPs to land and ocean environments in Europe and the Arctic. On the basis of annual snow fall data, we estimate an annual MP deposition of 8.8 ± 7.9 N m−2 (0 to 72 N m−2) in the Fram Strait, 1.4 ± 0.4 N m−2 in Svalbard (0 to 2 N m−2), and 66 ± 60.1 N m−2 (0 to 308 N m−2) in the Alps. It should be noted, however, that these estimates come with very large uncertainties given the variability of the data.
Abundance of MP particles and microfibers
Although MP levels were significantly higher in European (0.191 × 103 to 154 × 103 N liter−1) compared with Arctic snow (0 to 14.4 × 103 N liter−1), the conclusions drawn have to be treated with caution given the high variability and sparse spread of samples over large areas. Some variability may be due to the fact that snow from the Arctic was not freshly deposited unlike all European snow samples (except for Swiss snow) and could have been exposed to secondary dry deposition of airborne particles (23) for an unknown period of time. Still, the lower concentrations found in Arctic snow is not unusual given the distance of the Arctic to densely populated source areas. MP concentrations were also consistently higher in atmospheric fallout from densely populated urban compared with suburban or less densely populated sites in France and Dongguan (18, 26). Dehghani et al. (17) recorded MPs in the range of 3 to 20 N per gram of dry dust from Tehran. However, quantities are not directly comparable as wet deposition is a more efficient mode of transport than dry deposition (27), and different methods were used. The same applies to MPs recorded in dry fallout from Dongguan (31 to 43 N m−2 day−1) (18). The highest MP concentration was found in Bavarian snow. Since we took this sample next to a country road, traffic could play a role in terms of automotive emissions, dispersion of settled MPs by cars, and subsequent scavenging by falling snow. Experiments have shown that significant numbers of similar sized zinc sulfide particles placed on a road were swirled by cars (28). While the most abundant polymer types in this sample, rubber types 1 and 3, point to car tires as a potential source, no firm conclusions can be drawn because of current methodological constraints in the detection of specific rubber types. Still, the number of MPs in snow from a street in the city of Bremen, our most urban site (~568,000 inhabitants), was only intermediate (2 × 103 N liter−1). This could be due to lower particle dispersion as freshly deposited snow was collected on a Sunday when traffic is low. By contrast, the Bavarian sample was taken on a Monday with higher car traffic. Lonati et al. (29) reported a 20% lower emission of fine particles in Milano during weekends due to lower particle dispersion by decreased traffic. Snow from the North Sea island Heligoland ranked second and fourth highest (17.6 × 103 N liter−1), which is unexpected considering that it is inhabited by only ~1200 people and cars are banned. Although there was no significant correlation between MP levels and wind speed overall, strong easterly winds (18 m s−1) prevailing before and during the sampling time may have dispersed MPs from the island’s dune environment and possibly also transported particles from seawater or the mainland. The lowest European MP concentration was detected in a sample from the Swiss Alps (0.19 × 103 N liter−1). This could be considered background contamination as the site was neither urban nor close to traffic.
The MP levels in Arctic snow were still considerable with the third highest concentration (14.4 × 103 N liter−1) originating from an ice floe. The magnitude difference between Ice Floe 9 and other ice floe samples is notable. Until we know more about atmospheric MP pollution, we can only speculate that atmospheric MP pollution may be variable in both time and space resulting in large differences of MPs falling out via snow. Local wind conditions may play a role. In addition, Arctic ice floes are often carried from the Central Arctic to the south (i.e., Fram Strait) by the Transpolar Drift once the sea ice breaks up in spring (13, 16). During their drift, they may encounter different air masses carrying varying amounts of MP, which could cause the differences observed. Still, whatever the exact cause, it is unexpected given the remoteness of the location and poses the question “Where does it all come from?” It is conceivable that airborne MPs are emitted or dispersed locally by ships and by wind. Snow from the Vladivostok district contained particles of marine origin, including sea urchins, algae, and mollusk shells (30). Still, most of the particles likely originate from more distant regions. To shine a light on the issue, we draw on knowledge of pathways of mercury, which is found in high concentrations in Arctic wildlife. A mass-balance approach indicates that wet deposition via snow is the main pathway of mercury to the Arctic ocean (31). Three main routes of transport lead to an accumulation of mercury in the Arctic: (i) The Icelandic Low and North American High transport air masses from north America and western Europe (40%), (ii) the Aleutian Low brings air masses from the north Pacific and east Asia (25%), and (iii) the Siberian High delivers eastern European and Siberian air masses (15%) to the Arctic (31). As with mercury, MPs may be blown over long distances to the Arctic from urban areas in all directions, leading to unexpectedly high levels of MP in the Arctic atmosphere. This is likely exacerbated during high phases of the North Atlantic Oscillation (32). Even large mineral particles (≤450 μm) can be transported from the Sahara to the north Atlantic over distances of 3500 km by mechanisms such as rapid horizontal transport, turbulence, uplift in convective systems, and electrical levitation of particles (33). It has been estimated that pollen of willow and pine (10 to 200 μm) were transported from western Europe to the Arctic at an altitude of 3000 m in only 5 days (34).
Comparison with MP levels in Arctic Sea ice and deep-sea sediments
Unfortunately, a direct comparison of our results on MP particles with previous data on airborne MPs or those from Arctic seawater is not possible as the latter two deal primarily with fibers (but see the “Abundance of fibers” section) or use different methods resulting in much lower numbers (9, 10, 35). We can, however, compare our results of Arctic ice floes with previous data on MPs in Arctic sea ice and deep-sea sediments (15, 16), also to investigate whether airborne MPs are a source to these compartments. These studies used the same harmonized analytical methods and are thus comparable with our approach. MP concentrations ranged between 1.1 × 103 and 12 × 103 N liter−1 in Arctic sea ice, which tends to concentrate particles by a factor of 100 relative to adjacent seawater (16) and between 0.04 × 103 and 3.46 × 103 N liter−1 in deep-sea sediments (15). Given similar or higher levels in snow from ice floes (0 to 14.4 × 103 N liter−1), it seems likely that they contribute to MPs in sea ice and also sink to the seafloor over time. MPs deposited on ice floes via snow may be embedded directly into the sea ice matrix through snow metamorphism, i.e., compaction, or through release into melt ponds and subsequent refreezing. Another route to these matrices could simply be through wet deposition onto the ocean surface before or during sea ice formation. Once in seawater, MPs may sink to the seafloor. The composition of polymers in snow from ice floes seemed more similar to that of sea ice compared with deep-sea sediments. For example, varnish was one of the most frequent and abundant polymer types reported in both of these spheres but less important in sediments. Still, nitrile rubber and polyamide were important in both ice floe snow and deep-sea sediments and sea ice, such that these polymers may have been transported from the atmosphere to sea ice and the seafloor.
MP size
The size distribution of MPs in snow was unexpectedly similar to MP sizes found in Arctic sea ice and deep-sea sediments (15, 16). Most of the MPs detected in all of these spheres were in the smallest size range (11 μm). Scrutinized by scanning electron microscopy, MP particles from atmospheric fallout of Dongguan revealed signs of weathering such that Cai et al. (18) hypothesized atmospheric degradation processes through collision and friction dynamics, as well as chemical weathering due to higher irradiation and oxygen levels in the atmosphere. This could enhance fragmentation into smaller sizes. The fact that there is no size saturation in the smallest size range implies that there may be yet more particles in size categories below our current detection limit. In addition, smaller particles are probably more likely to be picked up and transported by air masses. No matter what the cause, our results likely underestimate MP quantities as was also concluded in previous studies (15, 16, 36). This highlights the need to quantify small particles for realistic assessments of MP pollution. Most studies currently focus on particles >200 to 300 μm in size.
Abundance of fibers
All snow samples contained fibers ranging between 0.043 × 103 and 10.2 × 103 N liter−1 with highest concentrations in snow from Ice Floe 4 followed by snow from Bremen. While it is unknown what proportion of these were synthetic polymers, our fiber concentrations were at least four to seven orders of magnitude higher than previous reports from outdoor and indoor environments near Paris (median, 0.0009 and 0.0054 N liter−1, respectively) (36). Fiber and MP abundance in Dongguan were in the same order of magnitude as samples from Paris (18). This large discrepancy is likely due to methodological differences and differences in the underlying mechanisms, i.e., dry versus wet deposition. Dris et al. (19) reported five times higher MP levels after a rain event, and snow can scavenge aerosol particles up to 50 times more efficiently than rain (22). Whatever the reasons, the high abundance of fibers in remote Arctic snow is notable, whereas high levels in urban Bremen do not come as a surprise. The positive correlation between fiber and MP concentrations may indicate that they both come from similar sources. While 33% of the fibers detected near Paris were polymers, 23% of the fibers from Dongguan were made of plastic (18, 36). If 28% (the mean of these two values) of the fibers from our study were also polymers, then this would add 0.012 × 103 to 2.86 × 103 N liter−1 and result in a total MP load of 0.029 × 103 to 156.86 × 103 N liter−1. However, this assumption has to be treated with caution since the proportion of natural fibers in our samples may differ from those of more urban areas.
Polymer composition
The polymer composition of samples was very variable, even at sites which were located in close proximity, e.g., Ice Floe 4 to Ice Floe 8, that came from the same ice floe. Scavenging of particles depends on the size of snow crystals, particle size, wind speed, air humidity, and snow intensity (22, 37) to name a few of many factors that may have influenced also the polymer composition. Variable polymer compositions were also reported from Arctic sea ice and deep-sea sediments (15, 16). The number of polymer types found per sample was highest in Bavaria (12 types), which is not unusual given that this was also the sample with the highest MP abundance and sampled next to a country road where settled MPs may be subject to dispersion by traffic. The number of detected polymer types both per sample and for all samples was much higher in this study (19) compared with atmospheric fallout from China (4) and France (3) (18, 26). This is likely due to wet deposition scavenging effects and methodological differences, because previous results were based on the analysis of visually preselected particles and considered only particles larger than 50 μm, which were also mostly fibers.
Varnish was the most frequent and among the top five most abundant polymer types. It was also detected in ice cores and deep-sea sediments albeit less frequently (15, 16). This reflects the widespread application of polymer-based varnish for protective coatings of surfaces, including vehicles, ships, wind turbines, aquaculture and buildings. The building sector accounts for ~20% of the European plastic converter demand (38). MPs may be emitted during construction on building sites, through abrasion of coated surfaces by wind and rain or when handling construction waste (39). Future research is needed to quantify the importance and pathway of this source of MPs.
Three different types of rubber were the next most frequent and the most abundant polymers. They may enter the environment as abrasion product from tires or as extremely durable synthetic rubber roofing membranes commonly used in roof construction (rubber type 3, ethylene-propylene-diene rubber). Abrasion from sealing gaskets (rubber type 1, sealing rubber), cable, and shoe soles could be further sources of rubber, some of which belong to the most common sources of MPs in Germany (39). While Arctic sea ice contained scant rubber particles, it was also found in deep-sea sediments (15, 16), where nitrile rubber was one of the most frequent and abundant polymers. As it is very resistant to a wide range of temperatures, as well as to oil, gasoline, and other chemicals, it is widely used for hoses, seals, O-rings, synthetic leather, grommets, cable jacketing, and transmission belts in offshore oil platforms and the automotive and aeronautical industry.
Polyamide (including nylon) was among the top five most frequent and abundant MPs detected. It was also reported from a household and atmospheric fallout in France (36). Polyamide is widely used in synthetic fabrics, automotive applications, fisheries, sails, toothbrushes, packaging, and carpets. It was more prevalent in European than in Arctic snow. Polyamide was, however, abundant in Atlantic and Arctic surface waters and deep-sea sediment (9, 10, 15, 16, 35, 40). Thus, pathways other than atmospheric transport may play a more prominent role in the transport of polyamide to the Arctic.
Likewise, PE occurred only in low numbers in two ice floe samples but was the most abundant polymer type detected in Arctic sea ice and Atlantic surface waters (9, 16, 35, 40) and prevailed in most European samples, as well as in atmospheric fallout of Dongguan (18) and a French household (36). Again, mechanisms other than atmospheric transport may be more important in PE transport to the Arctic.
Health implications
The large concentrations of MPs and microfibers in snow highlight the importance of the atmosphere as a source of airborne MPs and microfibers. Through this pathway, MPs likely find their way into soil and aquatic environments and therefore also into food chains. In populated areas, it is a common practice to remove snow from streets and transport it “away.” Our results show that these locations should be chosen wisely so as to avoid contamination of sensitive areas. Moreover, MPs in snow have fallen out of the atmosphere and could therefore be considered an indicator of aerial MP pollution. This is relevant in the context of human and animal health, especially in terms of inhabited European sites, where residents may breathe in airborne MPs and fibers. However, although we know that airborne contamination of seafood during indoor food preparation and meals exceeds original MP concentrations (41), there has been unexpectedly little research about the inhalation risk of airborne MPs. It has been postulated that only the smallest-sized MP fraction is respired into the deep lung while particles exceeding a length of 5 μm, with a diameter of <3 μm, and with a length-to-diameter ratio of 3:1 are subject to coughing or mucociliary clearance (21) such that they end up in the gastrointestinal tract. Still, the detection of MPs and other fibers of up to 135 μm in length in lung tissues, including carcinoma, challenges this notion (42, 43). MPs in pulmonary tissues may persist for a long time as they are durable in body fluids (21). Chronic inhalation of MPs, especially in combination with adsorbed or added chemicals (17), may lead to health risks including respiratory irritation, allergic alveolitis, inflammation, fibrosis, and genotoxicity (21). Pauly et al. (42) suggest that MPs may be considered candidate agents contributing to the risk of lung cancer, especially of nonsmokers. The high MP concentrations detected in snow samples from continental Europe to the Arctic indicate significant air pollution and stress the urgent need for research on human and animal health effects focusing on airborne MPs.
The high amount of MPs present in the atmosphere as indicated by significant concentrations in snow from continental Europe to the Arctic is puzzling at first. It is known, however, that snow either takes up aerosols or forms around aerosol nuclei containing pollutants, e.g., from vehicle exhaust particles (44). In addition, dust emitted from Earth surfaces, deposition, and dispersion between atmosphere, land surface, and the aquatic realm could facilitate the transportation of MPs (18), but research is needed to verify this. One open question is also whether aquatic environments act as a source of MPs to the atmosphere, e.g., during evaporation and storm events. This could also explain the high concentrations of MPs and fibers in secluded uninhabited regions such as the Arctic. Another explanation is long-range transport by wind systems bringing anthropogenic particles from urban sites. Large dust particles are transported over distances of 3500 km from the Sahara to the North Atlantic (33). This is similar to the distance between our Arctic sites and Europe, which happens to be the most important pathway in terms of wind-driven transport of mercury to the Arctic. Our results highlight a hitherto neglected pathway of MPs to the Arctic Ocean, an ecosystem that is already stressed by the effects of the climate crisis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study sites
Between 2015 and 2017, five ice floes drifting in the Arctic Fram Strait were visited by ship-based helicopters or dinghies during three expeditions of the research icebreaker RV Polarstern (Fig. 1A and Table 1). Surface snow was sampled with a prerinsed mug, a steel spoon, or a soup ladle and transferred into containers made of PVC, PE, or glass (see table S2 for more details). In March 2018, five samples were taken at different locations on Svalbard (Fig. 1A and Table 1) by citizen scientists embarking on a land expedition by ski doo (Aemalire project). The citizens were instructed on contamination prevention and equipped with protocol forms, prerinsed 2-liter stainless steel containers (Ecotanca), a porcelain mug, a steel spoon, and a soup ladle for sampling.
In February 2018, the surface of freshly deposited snow was transferred with a spoon from parking cars in the city of Bremen into glass jars (Fig. 1B and Table 1). Only surface snow was taken, leaving behind a thin layer of snow on top of car surfaces. One month later, freshly deposited surface snow was collected with a soup ladle on the Isle of Heligoland from the backyard and next to a pedestrian path in front of the Alfred Wegener Institute campus (Fig. 1B and Table 1), avoiding soil and bottom surfaces. In the Swiss Alps, surface snow was collected with a spoon at a snowfield in the surroundings of Tschuggen and in the village of Davos (Fig. 1B). This snow had fallen 2 days before sampling (7 March 2018). In the Bavarian Alps (Germany), citizens transferred freshly fallen surface snow with a steel spoon from three different locations into glass jars that had been prerinsed with tap water (Fig. 1B and Table 1): Sample 1 was taken next to a country lane, sample 2 was collected next to a country lane and a lake, and sample 3 was taken in a green area with nearby anthropogenic activity. All teams worked with bare hands, and the equipment was rinsed with Milli-Q water, tap water, or snow. Except for the Bavarian samples, potential sample contamination from the sealing of glass jars was minimized by a sheet of tin foil. Samples were kept frozen but defrosted during transport to Heligoland or in the laboratory.
Contamination prevention and procedural blanks
All personnel taking samples was instructed to position themselves against the wind and sample undisturbed snow in front of them with bare hands to avoid contamination. If not stated otherwise, all laboratory ware was made of glass or stainless steel and thoroughly rinsed with Milli-Q water before use. All polymer-based items, which could not be replaced by alternatives (e.g., bottle caps and filter holders) were made of polytetrafluoroethylene, a polymer that cannot be detected within the current FTIR imaging settings (25). Airborne particles were filtered by dustboxes (DB1000, G4 before filtration, HEPA-H14 final filtration, Q = 950 m3 hour−1, Möcklinghoff Lufttechnik) in laboratories for particle sorting and FTIR analyses. All filtration steps were performed in a laminar flow cabinet (ScanLaf Fortuna, LaboGene). Cotton laboratory coats and clothes were worn to reduce contamination from synthetic textiles.
To account for possible contamination from plastic sample containers, two procedural blanks were created in the laboratory by filling the PVC and PE containers used with Milli-Q water and stored at −20°C for 4 days to simulate the freezing and thawing process. To assess possible contamination of the Bavarian snow samples from used tap water and the resin sealing in lids, a similar glass jar was filled with tap water and frozen by the citizen scientists. All blanks were processed in the same way as the snow samples. For the plastic containers, up to three FTIR imaging runs were performed because of low numbers found to obtain a reliable result, which represents the extent of MP contamination. No blanks were taken during field sampling. The amounts of MPs determined in the samples with available blanks were corrected by converting the quantity of MPs detected in the blank to the sample volumes (table S2). The number of particles per liter was calculated for each sample on the basis of the volume of melted snow. The polymer types, abundance, and sizes of MPs in procedural blanks are available in table S4. Blanks from the PE container harbored 256 N liter−1 and consisted primarily of PE. The PVC flask contained 308 N liter−1, most of which was polypropylene and PVC. The glass jar that had been prerinsed with tap water contained the highest number of MP (27,243 N liter−1) with a diverse mix of polymer types, mostly PE and rubber types 1 and 3. To address the uncertainty of all results regarding possible contamination, the propagation of uncertainty was calculated (45) as described in note S1.
Analytical procedure for the detection of (MP) particles
Following three overhead twists, an aliquot [10 ml: 1 ml of sample (melted snow) diluted with 9 ml of Milli-Q] of each sample was analyzed by FlowCam (Fluid Imaging Technologies, Scarborough, USA) three times to visualize and quantify particle concentrations and sizes and thereby a potential area coverage. On the basis of this assessment, a specific volume of the sample, ranging between 0.2 and 100% of the calculated volume for full area coverage, was filtered onto an aluminum oxide filter (Ø = 25 mm; pore size, 0.2 μm; Anodisc, Whatman, Germany). This step is essential to avoid a particle overload of the filter, which would lead to a total absorption of subsequent measurement by FTIR radiation and error in the resulting particle counts. Despite this precaution, the membrane of eight snow samples became clogged during filtration such that it was stopped and the filtrated volume was recorded.
After drying in a desiccator for 2 days, the filter was placed onto the calcium fluoride window of an FTIR microscope, and an overview image was taken (×40 magnification). The particles on the filter were analyzed by a Hyperion 3000 μFTIR microscope equipped with a focal plane array (FPA) detector with 64 × 64 detector elements and connected to a TENSOR 27 spectrometer (Bruker Optics GmbH, Germany). A visible objective (×4 magnification) and an infrared (IR) objective (×3.5 magnification) along with an IR range of 3600 to 1250 cm−1 was used for measurements performed with the software OPUS 7.5 (Bruker Optics). The measurement area of 20 × 20 FPA (14.1 by 14.1 mm) fields comprised the entire sample-filter surface and produced measurements of 400 single fields. Measurements were performed by a 3.5× IR objective in a transmission mode with 32 scans per FPA field without binning at a resolution of 8 cm−1, allowing the detection of particles down to 11 μm in ~4.5 hours.
Detection of fibers
Because of the design of the particle analysis pipeline during FTIR image analysis, fibers can currently not be identified reliably with this automated method. Still, to enable comparison with previous studies, the fibers present on each filter were counted and photographed using a stereomicroscope (×8 magnification; Olympus SZX16). The total number of fibers per filter was extrapolated to 1 liter of melted snow. The total number of fibers found in the blanks (n = 83) was subtracted from the sample results. In addition, the length of fibers of suspected anthropogenic origin was measured using CellSens Micro Imaging tools (×8 to ×32 magnification; Olympus, Germany).
Data analysis
The FTIR imaging data were automatically processed (24). Briefly, each spectrum in the measurement file was analyzed via two library searches to confirm polymer identity using an adaptable database design (25). The library can be downloaded (https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00216-018-1156-x). Each pixel identified was stored with its position, analysis quality, and, finally, assigned polymer type into a file, which was subject to image analysis based on Python 3.4 scripts and SimpleITK functions (24). This approach enabled the identification, quantification, and size determination of all polymer particles while excluding human bias (24). MP particles were assigned to size classes to reduce the complexity of the size distribution and for comparison with previous studies.
All statistical comparisons were made based on nonparametric statistics (Mann-Whitney U test, Minitab 18, Statistica 13). We tested for Spearman’s rank correlations between wind speed on the sampling day and MP quantity, as well as correlations between MP and fiber concentrations (Minitab 18; P > 0.05). The polymer composition of samples from Europe and the Arctic was compared by multivariate analyses (PERMANOVA, PRIMER-e version 6.1.16 with PERMANOVA 1.0.6) based on Bray-Curtis similarities of fourth-root transformed data of polymer types (46). The SIMPER routine of PRIMER-e was used to assess what polymer type contributed to the dissimilarity.
The annual MP and fiber fallout was calculated for the areas sampled using mean annual snowfall values for Fram Strait [200 kg m−2 (47)], Svalbard [450 kg m−2 (48)], and Davos [500 kg m−2 (49)] as tentative estimates for MP and fiber deposition rates via snow. Bremen and Heligoland were not included because snow fall in these regions is ephemeral. The density of melted snow samples was assumed as water density (1 kg liter−1).

Project Background
The geopolitical and global economic significance of the Arctic region has been growing fast, inter alia because of climate change as well as resource and economic development. The changes we witness in the Arctic – ecological, social and economic – affect both men and women although sometimes in different ways.
The gap between women and men with regard to economic participation and political empowerment remains wide and must continue to be addressed. Our common goal is to secure equal opportunities for men and women, to enable boys and girls to lead the lives they desire in a world without discrimination. This subject must become an integral part of Arctic policies in order to strengthen social well-being and support sustainable development in the region.
In the autumn of 2013 a proposal was submitted to the Arctic Council for a project aimed to promote a dialogue on gender equality in the Arctic region and to raise awareness of the situation of women and men in the Arctic. This would include addressing key issues such as control over resources, representation in decision-making, political participation, and material and cultural well-being.
The purpose of this project would be to promote an extensive, policy-relevant dialogue on issues of gender equality in the Arctic region in the context of current realities in terms of economic and social development as well as current and future challenges, inter alia relating to climatic and environmental changes.
The conference in 2014 also received invaluable support and expertise from members of its scoping committee, including: Dr. Gail Fondahl, University of Northern British Columbia; Assistant Professor Erika Hayfield, University of the Faroe Islands; Assistant Professor Auður H. Ingólfsdóttir, Bifröst University; Assistant Professor Anna Karlsdóttir, University of Iceland; Ph.D. student Liza Mack, Aleut International Organization; Dr. Päivi Naskali, University of Lapland; Senior Adviser Lise Östby, Norwegian Directorate for Children, Youth and Families; Director Kristinn Schram, Centre for Arctic Policy Studies of the University of Iceland. Thank you all for your valuable insights and dynamic discussions.
Phase I \\ 2013-2015
Conference and Report
Project partners in the circumpolar region joined hands to organize the international conference Gender Equality in the Arctic – Current realities, future challenges.
The conference took place in Akureyri, Iceland in October 2014 and attracted 150 scholars, NGOs, politicians, government and business representatives from all the Arctic States. Information about the conference itself, partners and sponsors, as well as recordings of all conference sessions can be found on the conference website.
The report Gender Equality in the Arctic: Current realities, future challenges (pub. 2015) builds on the comprehensive presentations and discussions that took place during the conference in Akureyri. The report contributes to advancing debate and research on gender issues and calls attention to the continued disparity between women and men with regard to economic participation and political empowerment.
Key outcome of the report are policy relevant highlights derived from the conference material:
Gender issues and equality should be a priority in the Arctic region
Women’s access to and participation in political and economic spheres in the public or private sectors must be improved.
Arctic states bear an obligation to ensure gender equality and eliminate all forms of discrimination.
Diversity within gender categories must be respected and complex gender identities taken into account.
Economic diversity and knowledge based companies will be a key to sustainable northern development in the future. Innovation and entrepreneurship are vital to community and regional development in the north.
Policy concerning climate change must include women’s and indigenous peoples’ perspectives.
Gender roles are in the process of gradual transition. Men need to be more actively engaged in the gender debate.
A greater understanding of social contexts and determinants is needed for effective suicide prevention.
Migration patterns must be taken into account in policy-making.
Achieving gender equality requires a combination of different tools, f.ex. Gender Based Analysis (GBA) and Gender mainstreaming.
State centered discourses continue to set the agenda in the Arctic. The traditional “state security” framework needs competition and critical analysis.
Diversity in educational opportunities and in the labor market must be created or maintained. Education has a gendered dimension and attitudes towards education must change.
Responses to change are diverse and context based, and require adaptive capacity from individuals as well as communities. Males and females respond and adapt differently to change.
Analysis reveals a contradiction between a “masculine” discourse of resource utilization and “feminine” discourse of climate change threats.
Health and well-being in Arctic communities must be taken into account in policy making
The concept of historical trauma can be useful in explaining social realities in troubled Arctic communities.
Alternative media provides opportunities to view, re-view, observe and recreate representations of gender.
Phase II \\ 2017-2019
Network and Project Website
Phase II builds on the success of the conference and report, both of which were well received. The purpose and expected outcome is to:
Promote and expand the dialogue on Gender Equality in the Arctic.
Provide a formal network of groups and experts, interested in issues of Gender Equality in the Arctic.
Encourage cooperation with and between existing networks on Gender Equality in the Arctic.
Provide an online platform for material and events relevant to Gender Equality in the Arctic.
Organize, collaborate on and participate in workshops and conferences relevant to Gender Equality in the Arctic.
See our one pager (300 kb PDF) for information and dissemination purposes.

Together Towards a Sustainable Arctic
We are proud to announce that Gender Equality in the Arctic has moved into its third phase (GEA III), following the handover of the Arctic Council Chairmanship from Finland to Iceland. The GEA is a Sustainable Development Working Group (SDWG) project as well as a project under the Icelandic Chairmanship Programme 2019-2021.
The Icelandic Chairmanship Program - Together Towards a Sustainable Arctic – includes four main priority areas: the Arctic Marine Environment; Climate and Green Energy Solutions; People and Communities of the Arctic; and a Stronger Arctic Council. The GEA III falls under the priority People and Communities of the Arctic which includes initiatives that aim to promote the wellbeing of the roughly four million people living in the region.
Gender equality is an important element for achieving sustainable development. Iceland will continue to lead a project that aims to promote dialogue on gender equality in the Arctic and strengthen a network of experts and stakeholders in the field.
For more information, visit People and Communities of the Arctic on the Icelandic Government’s website.
GEA III is an Arctic Council Sustainable Development Working Group (SDWG) project and a chairmanship project of the Icelandic Arctic Council Chairmanship 2019-2021, as part of the priority People and Communities of the Arctic. Project leader is Iceland with co-leadership from Sweden, Finland, Canada, the Saami Council, the Aleut International Association, and the USA.
The purpose and objective of the GEA III project is to raise visibility and understanding of the importance of gender-issues in the Arctic, to identify priorities and concrete strategies for increased diversity and gender balance in policy- and decision-making processes and to provide information to facilitate sustainable policy making for the future.
A primary component of GEAIII is a Pan-Arctic Report on Gender and Diversity in the Arctic. Read more on the Report.
Moreover, a GEA Times digital Newsletter is being published quarterly, focusing on disseminating information about the status of GEA III and highlighting gender related topics in the Arctic. Contributions from as many, and as diverse, individuals and groups as possible are encouraged to represent the various realities that people in the Arctic inhabit.
Calling for Material
An important output of the GEA project is to provide an online platform for an inventory of existing networks, projects, reports, books and articles as well as videos and events related to issues of equality in the Arctic. Visit the Published Materials page to learn more.

Developing Tourism in Greenland – More than an Industry?
In Greenland, politicians and businesses are hoping and planning for substantial growth in tourism. As the construction of three transatlantic airports draws closer, a broader societal discussion of how (much) tourism should be developed, in what ways, and by whom, is lacking. In this article, we show how tourism practitioners in Greenland perceive the challenges and potential posed by tourism and discuss how its development could be linked to other spheres of society—turning tourism from an industry into a potential catalyst for social change.
Arctic Tourism on the Rise
While tourist numbers in the Arctic are still relatively low in comparison to other parts of the world,1) tourism is currently experiencing unprecedented attention in Arctic regions. Greenland is no exception to this trend. Successful marketing combined with a growing global interest in the Arctic has led to an increasing amount of tourists and; unsurprisingly, to a coinciding rise in political and societal interest in tourism.
Today, tourism is proposed as one of Greenland’s three economic pillars, next to fishing and mining, and as a promising lever for the Arctic nation’s future economic development.2) Its successful development could potentially help pave the way for the Arctic nation’s independence from the Danish Commonwealth.
In the coming years, large infrastructure projects—partially triggered by a wish to facilitate transatlantic tourism—will require large-scale investments. While there is a continuous public debate about the location, building, and enlargement of the proposed three airports and several harbors, very little attention is given in public discourse to broader questions of tourism development.
For a community with less than 60.000 inhabitants, living conditions in Greenland are due to become affected as tourism numbers swell. In a research project conducted by Aalborg University mapping the current tourism landscape in Greenland, one of the interlocutors from a major travel agency voiced his concern: “Nobody has tried to sit down and to find out how we want it [tourism]. On what kinds of conditions and terms do we want this development?”.
Despite significant changes on the horizon, a discussion of how tourism should be developed, how much is desired, in what ways, and by whom, has until now remained absent.
A Fish called Tourism? Lessons from Iceland
This lack of concern about the impacts of tourism is surprising considering the proximity to Iceland, currently witnessing an explosive intake of tourists. While the two destinations are hardly comparable in terms of what they offer , their infrastructure, and their capacity, seeing the massive impacts that tourism has created on the neighboring nation could trigger some reflections. One could look to Iceland, for example, on how to understand the role and transformative capacity of tourism in society.
In his 2015 article “A Fish Called Tourism”, Icelandic tourism researcher Gunnar Thór Jóhannesson prophetically warned a euphoric Icelandic tourism industry on the dangers of thinking about tourism as yet another business opportunity.3) In his account of how tourism evolved to be taken seriously as “a real business”, Jóhannesson describes how tourism was gradually taken up during the late 1990s as a solution to the continual crisis in the agricultural sector with farmers being offered financial support to turn from farming sheep and cows to “herding” tourists. Similar to the situation in Greenland today, tourism in Iceland seemed to offer a beam of hope as the traditional staples of the economy were in crisis.
Parallel to this development, the Icelandic Tourist Board convincingly transferred important vocabulary of fishery management to tourism, equating the export value of each tourist to a ton of cod, talking of “tourist stock” and depicting the airplanes of Icelandair as “trawlers”. This, Jóhannesson argued, helped position tourism in the discourse on the national economy as similar to and on par with fisheries and heavy industries.
While such an approach helps policy makers and investors to recognize tourism as a ‘real business’, the problem is that a narrative framing the tourism sector in terms of fisheries hides its complexity. Unlike fish, tourists do not stay in the oceans around Iceland, but interfere in good and bad ways with life on shore. In the context of tourism policy making, it is important to acknowledge the ways in which tourism activities are connected to the environment and visited societies and to view tourism as more than just another industry, similar to that of mining and fisheries.
Tourism: more than an Industry?
A similar argument can be found in the article “More than an ‘industry’: The forgotten power of tourism as a social force”. Based on historical document studies from international tourism organizations and councils, Australian tourism researcher Freya Higgins-Desbiolles depicts how tourism from its very early proliferation was seen as a way to facilitate social change and further intercultural understanding.4) As economic and industrial discourses continually exposed tourism to market forces from the mid-1900s, the dominant perception of tourism was successfully transformed into that of an industry.
As a result, tourism research and policy making are today overwhelmingly dedicated to the business side of tourism, viewing tourism as a strictly economic endeavor. However, as argued by Higgins-Desbiolles, tourism is not merely an industry but rather a social force with deep transformative capacities for societies, cultures, and the environment.
Jóhannessons’s and Higgins-Desbiolles’ attempt to revive and reinforce a wider vision of the role of tourism in local and global communities lead us back to the initial questions of how tourism as a social force could work as a catalyst for change in Arctic communities. How could tourism be mobilized in meaningful ways to help engage with local challenges in the Arctic? As discussions about sustainability unsurprisingly continue to grow in an Arctic context—and there is a push to incorporate society and the environment into economic development—planning for tourism in Arctic communities could be guided by more than market forces.
We turn to Greenland to exemplify how tourism is connected to societal challenges in the Arctic and how this might offer ways to rethinking tourism as something more than an industry in a Greenlandic context. We discuss three ways in which the development of tourism is linked to societal challenges: in the field of cultural heritage, within education, and in the area of entrepreneurship.
The examples are drawn from the research project “Tourism Development in Greenland – Identification and Inspiration” where Greenlandic tourism stakeholders in Kangerlussuaq, Sisimiut, Ilulissat, and Nuuk shared insights on how they work with and envision tourism.5)
Cultural Heritage and Local Knowledge—New Possibilities in Tourism?
We find a powerful example of how tourism is connected to current societal challenges in the area of cultural heritage. While kayaks are less and less used for their original hunting purpose, local knowledge about them is still present and the tourist interest in kayak touring and building is increasing. By becoming part of tourism activities and a potential business, local knowledge is not only mobilized, but also contributes to the sustaining—and reconceptualization—of cultural heritage. This illustrates how tourism can play a crucial part in Arctic societies today in potentially re-activating local knowledge.
Tourism and community stakeholders work together; for instance, in integrating cultural heritage and local knowledge into local tourism products and experiences. At a visit to the UNESCO site Ilulissat Icefjord, its site manager noted the raising interest in Greenlandic kayaks: “There are people who travel from all over the world and want to do workshops on how to build a Greenlandic kayak. The interest in building Greenlandic kayaks is so high.[…] we can use this interest in building your own kayak and do offers here in Greenland”.
However, questions of risk, safety, and certification prevail: “[Locals] are more than qualified to take people out but the problem is they are not certified as sea kayak instructors, even though they know more about the kayak”. While official certification might function to assure the tourist of the highest degree of safety, integrating local knowledge, which has been passed down from generation to generation as informal non-certified skills, through certification is highly complex.
This raises the question of how to create a certification framework which acknowledges local knowledge and it’s anchoring in local cultural heritage, but also responds to standardized requirements. In this work to connect local knowledge and experience to the development of tourism products, tourism actors point to collaboration as central to their work. Collaboration offers them the possibility to build capacity and share knowledge. Collaborative activities also highlight the potential and value of informal knowledge based on acquired everyday skills.
Education
The challenge of certification intersects with general concerns regarding the educational sector in Greenland. According to one tourism stakeholder, “one of the toughest social challenges in Greenland is education. We definitely need to have more people educated. Education is our guiding star right now. It has been for years and it will be for years. We have to do that in collaboration with companies and municipalities, with everybody”.
Another tourism actor supports this by saying that education “is the main challenge of all. We have been talking about tourism and the overall infrastructure, but one of the biggest challenges is education. That is something we can agree upon in the whole of the country”. So while education is crucial for developing stronger and more innovative tourism services and experiences, the specificities of tourism also calls for specific skills.
Good language skills are quintessential to operate successfully: “If you have problems with speaking English and Danish, it’s really difficult to operate a tourism business”. This rudimentary demand is paired with the expressed need for raising service levels and thus calls for improving the relatively low educational level in Greenland, where only ¼ of the population graduates from high school and little over 10% receive a college degree.6)
Campus Kujalleq, located in South Greenland, has developed new educational programs in Arctic tourist guiding, adventure guiding, and in hospitality and tourism management. Several informants from the public and private sector point to a climbing number of graduates as an example showcasing the interest in this field. According to a teacher it is also “a very popular education, attracting quite many and they all go out and find a job in tourism after [they have finished their studies]”.
By combining a tourism workforce training with a raising awareness of the role and (re)activation of local knowledge and informally acquired skills,7) tourism contributes to crafting new educational offers and an increasing interest in attaining post-secondary education.
Seeing and talking of tourism as an industry easily overlooks the clear connections between developing tourism, raising the educational level at a national level, and providing attractive educational and training opportunities. By linking the development of tourism to issues of education, we see its ability to supplement existing educational offerings for the young generation and contribute to future educational groundings as new career opportunities and paths in tourism open itself to new groups of young people.
Entrepreneurship
A representative from Corporate Social Responsibility Greenland raised concerns about the need to build local capacity in tourism by including new, younger actors: “If we want to develop tourism, it does not only happen with the people that are already involved. We also need to involve more young people. That way we can develop our own community in a sustainable way”. This touches upon a similar issue, entrepreneurship, which has so far received very little governmental attention.
Entrepreneurship is increasingly recognized on a global scale as an important factor in changing and developing societies. The last decade has witnessed an increasing focus on developing strategies for entrepreneurship education in a Nordic context. In Greenland however, limited experience has been made in this area. As stated in the report Nordic Entrepreneurship Islands, published by the Danish Foundation for entrepreneurship, the country has no national strategy or goals for entrepreneurship education, no ministry involvement or any national definition.8) In spite of any governmental strategy, Greenlandic tourism actors at a local level point to an increased interest in entrepreneurship and link this to new opportunities created through the intensification of tourism. In the words of one: “Especially in tourism now, you can see a potential. It’s really moving forward. And people see that potential and start new things towards exploiting it”.
Tourism entrepreneurs in Greenland are typically small, often seasonal initiatives, offering services or products such as equipment, souvenirs, food products, or excursions. Their businesses are often characterized by collaboration. As stated by a tourism actor in West Greenland, this collaboration creates benefits beyond the often small business themselves: “When you have small entrepreneurs in a small community, everyone relies on the others, and we all take a little share of the cake”.
Tourism actors identify entrepreneurship in tourism as a potential lever to lifting Greenlandic businesses and communities. As stated by a tourism actor in Greenland, “we see more and more people getting into the tourism business, taking the guide education and we hear about people who are thinking of starting something new in Greenland, which is very positive”.
The tourism product is often composed of many different ‘subservices’ such as transportation, accommodation and catering to mention the most basic. In order to create and deliver tourism products, tourism actors therefore rely on each other and need to work together. An example on how entrepreneurial activities and collaboration emerge on a community scale comes from cruise tourism, where smaller villages in Northern Greenland often have the whole village involved. According to a cruise operator: “now when the cruise ships come in, the locals are all in their national costumes and everybody is selling small things, souvenirs. This is what they are doing now. That is what is needed. It’s not one or two operators in a small town; it needs to be the whole community”.
Developed collaboratively, tourism holds the potential to inspire new ways of thinking about and engage with local challenge. Emerging local tourism initiates show that education, entrepreneurship and community development are not issues separate from tourism, but are rather—as shown in these examples—intrinsically linked to them and that new opportunities in each of these areas could be developed together, rather than separately.
Expanding the Values of Arctic Tourism Development
Insights from tourism actors in Greenland display that tourism, as argued by Jóhannesson and Higgins-Desbiolles, is not merely an industry but a social force. Tourism is increasingly recognized as significant for the future economic development of Arctic communities,9) but this should be accompanied by careful preparation. If planned with local challenges and resources in mind, tourism has much to offer to local communities, for instance in revaluing and activating cultural heritage, in assisting in recognizing and certifying local (informal) knowledge, raising the level of education, and stimulating and facilitating entrepreneurial activities.
The hands-on challenges and concerns of tourism stakeholders in Greenland display the acute need for strategic calls to action grounded in public involvement. Arctic tourism is not merely a fish-like resource to be “trawled” or mined but a powerful societal force to be carefully managed. Public discussion is needed on where tourism development is currently heading, how it could be planned and developed in the future, and how it might also be connected to other societal challenges as “more than an industry”.

Arctic sea ice acts as a huge white reflector at the top of the planet, bouncing some of the sun’s rays back into space, helping keep the Earth at an even temperature.
But man-made climate change means the Arctic has warmed over the past few decades – actually about twice as much as the global average.
As the sea ice melts there’s less to reflect the rays, and more heat is absorbed by the ocean, magnifying the warming effect.
The Arctic also helps circulate the world's ocean currents, moving cold and warm water around the globe.

_______________________
Last summer, I had the incredible opportunity to visit Arctic Alaska. It is a region that’s as vast as it is beautiful. It is also an area that’s critical for the health of our planet. Often referred to as “the world’s refrigerator,” the Arctic plays an essential role in regulating global temperatures and counteracting climate change.
But, the Arctic is in trouble.
Experiencing accelerated effects of climate crisis, it is warming at twice the rate as the rest of the globe.
And a melting Arctic should alarm everyone. These dramatic shifts are further destabilizing temperatures around the world, and threatening one of the most vital and pristine ecosystems on the planet.
Incredibly, for some, the diminishing sea ice opens new opportunity. For the first time ever, there exists the possibility of cargo traffic through Arctic sea routes that were previously unnavigable. The draw is decreased transit times compared to traditional routes. While not yet a regular service offered by ocean container carriers, transit through the Northeast Passage is a very real possibility. Test voyages completed by some ocean carriers and studies estimate the Northern Sea Route could be used for approximately 8% of total container trade between Asia and Europe by 2030, increasing to ~10% of such trade by 2050. We do not have to accept that outcome.
The science is clear. Even with regulation, substantial and irreversible risk to the environment exists in the form of oil spills, emissions, vessel strikes and invasive species, which not only impact marine life, but also the human populations that rely on a healthy Arctic ecosystem for their livelihood. Beyond that, it’s estimated that carbon emissions from shipping via the Northeastern Passage would be significantly higher due to the need for smaller, less efficient vessels and increased fuel requirements.
It shouldn’t be an option for anyone.
At Nike, we exist to serve athletes. That means protecting the future of sport by helping to protect the planet and taking climate action through Move to Zero, Nike’s journey towards a zero carbon, zero waste future. We know climate change impacts how and where our athletes train and play, and whether they get to enjoy sport at all.
If there is no planet, there is no sport.
For Nike, this means thinking about how we design and make our product all the way through to how our products are delivered all over the world – and we’ve made a clear choice – it won’t be through the Arctic.
We’ve made a commitment to not intentionally allow our products to be shipped on vessels via any Arctic sea route. And, we’re partnering with Ocean Conservancy, a leading advocate for the oceans and waterways, to encourage all companies and industries to make the same commitment through the Arctic Shipping Corporate Pledge (“Pledge”).
We’re joined in making this Pledge by Bestseller, Columbia, Gap Inc., H&M Group, Kering, Li & Fung, PVH Corp., and ocean carriers CMA CGM, Evergreen, Hapag-Lloyd and Mediterranean Shipping Company, all companies who are helping to preserve the Arctic through their commitment.

Though the boats, rigs and other trappings of human activity have already quickly moved into this fragile environment, scientists are only just beginning to understand how the light, sound and chemical pollution they bring with them is impacting the Arctic’s marine ecosystem.
Some researchers have started filling in the gaps, including two teams working in Norway that presented new findings about the behaviors of zooplankton and killer and humpback whales at the Arctic Frontiers 2020 conference in the nation’s city of Tromsø in January. Though zooplankton may seem to have little in common with whales, research shows that creatures at both extremes of the Arctic food web are critical to the health of the marine ecosystem. Understanding how industry affects these animals could help inform policies governing commercial activities in the Arctic.
Light Sensitivity
Tiny zooplankton move in response to light cues during the day. When the sun rises in the morning, they drift down closer to the seabed to avoid predators. When the sun sets, they ascend toward the surface to feed. During the 24 hours of darkness occurring in the Arctic winter—a nearly month-long period called the polar night—scientists had thought zooplankton simply stopped moving under the sea ice, says Jørgen Berge, a taxonomist and marine biologist at UiT–the Arctic University of Norway.
But that thinking changed after the winter of 2007–2008, when Berge noticed that zooplankton in the fjords of the Svalbard archipelago were still moving up and down in patterns similar to the ones they followed when the sun shone. He found they could still sense and respond to low levels of light from the moon, the aurora borealis and background illumination from the sun—even under thick layers of ice and snow. “It was a complete surprise to us,” Berge says.
In subsequent work, he showed that other Arctic denizens, such as shrimp, krill, herring and cod, would also respond to light levels that were orders of magnitude lower than the ones similar species experience in waters elsewhere around the world. This left him concerned that Arctic animals would be extra sensitive to artificial light and that exposure to it could change important aspects of their behavior. Such light pollution, which shines with an intensity and composition not found in nature, has been shown to disrupt the hormone production and metabolism of many vertebrate species, including fish—and humans.
To investigate, Berge monitored how Arctic animals moved in response to the artificial lights from just one ship: his own research vessel. In three locations during the polar night of 2019, Berge measured the total mass of the marine animals around the ship with the lights on and off. In each case, there was a significant difference. At one location, there were about half as many animals around the ship when the lights were switched on. In another, with a different animal population, the biomass increased with the lights on—a response Berge says is not surprising, because, like moths on land, some marine animals have adapted to be attracted to light instead of repelled by it.
This research, published Thursday in Communications Biology, has strong implications for the fishing industry, Berge says. Norwegian authorities currently gather information about the abundance of fish in the area throughout the year, including during the polar night, and use that information to determine fishing limits. But because these assessments are carried out with artificial lights on, “that could have a strong bias,” Berge notes. “Our ability to measure and understand and make good predictions as to how much you can fish could be based on wrong input data.”
Likewise Berge believes that no scientific study that has ever been conducted during the polar night—with lights turned on—could be considered an unbiased representation of how the animals would naturally behave during that time. “In darkness and light, you will get two very different results, and the knowledge about the system will be very different,” Berge says. Franz Hölker, an ecologist at the Leibniz Institute of Freshwater Ecology and Inland Fisheries in Germany, who studies light pollution but was not involved with the new work, agrees. He says Berge’s findings mirror some of his own.
Safety concerns for humans make it impractical to ban artificial light in the Arctic altogether, Berge says. “Rather we need to understand what effects light pollution is causing.” That way, the level of bias in scientific studies and fishery estimates could be quantified and, to some degree, corrected.
Where the Whales Are
The need for more knowledge of human industry’s effects exists on the other end of the Arctic animal size scale as well. Though fishing, shipping, and oil and gas activities have expanded rapidly in the Arctic, “we have no idea what the whales are doing,” says Evert Mul, a Ph.D. student at UiT. “We plan those activities without taking into account the presence and the distribution and the behavior of the whales.”
To help change that situation, Mul and his colleagues at UiT and the Institute of Marine Research in Norway have tagged 45 killer whales and 30 humpback whales over the past seven years—many more than in previous tagging studies. Doing so allowed them to map how these whales interact with the human activities taking place in polar regions for what they say is the first time ever in this part of the Arctic.
Mul says the team’s results, which he expects to publish this summer, show the whales spent significant amounts of time in the locations where there was heavy shipping traffic, as well as oil and gas installations. “And of course, they spend a lot of time near fishing vessels,” because they are drawn to the massive amounts of fish the commercial boats collect, he says. It is not uncommon to see anywhere from 50 to 100 whales around a single vessel, Mul adds. Attracted to such a concentration of these spectacular animals, boats filled with tourists join the action, too.
Greg Breed, a biologist and associate professor at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, who was not involved with Mul’s work, has observed similar confluences in human and whale activity during his own studies in the Canadian Arctic. “They happen to overlap because they’re using the same space,” he says. For example, whales take advantage of the ice-free passages cleared by large vessels.
Though the whales may seem to benefit from easy snacks swiped while swimming near fishing boats, human activity may harm the animals, too. Many of the cetaceans tagged in Mul’s study have visible scars from entanglement with fishing nets or collisions with boat hulls or propellers. Noise pollution can interfere with the complex songs the creatures use to communicate, he says. Chemical pollution is another issue. Killer whales already have some of the highest contamination from polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) on earth, and modeling has demonstrated this problem could endanger the long-term survival of the Arctic killer whale population.
As Breed points out, though, it is also possible that stressors other than physical injuries or pollutants—such as interruptions to the marine food chain linked to warming ocean waters—could be having more of an impact on Arctic whale populations. Potential impacts, including those identified by Mul and Berge, should be considered when making decisions about industry in the Arctic, the researchers say. Like Berge, Mul believes the best course of action at this point is not to call for drastic bans but for policies that make obvious sense—such as better regulation of pollutants where whales are more abundant. Mul also stresses the need to continue improving the information scientists have about the magnitude of the problem.
Even with limited knowledge, those who are planning industrial activities in the Arctic still need to be aware of the possibility that their presence could have repercussions, Mul says. He would like industries to at least “have the seasonal whale distribution in the back of their mind, even while we are still continuing to understand, and to map, the situation.” To help with this effort, Mul plans to hold a meeting with Norwegian industry leaders to inform them of his results and seek feedback about how he can present the information in a way that is useful to them. “It's very important,” he says, “to have at least a basic understanding of what the animals are doing that we are going to share this region with.”",,Chiara Eisner,,,2020-03-05,Scientific American

figures by Lillian Horin
The Arctic apple is the juiciest newcomer to produce aisles. It has the special ability to resist browning after being cut (Figure 1), which protects its flavor and nutritional value. Browning also contributes to food waste by causing unappealing bruising on perfectly edible apples. Food waste, especially for fruits and vegetables, is a major problem worldwide; nearly half of the produce that’s grown in the United States is thrown away, and the UK supermarket Tesco estimates that consumer behavior significantly contributes to the 40% of its apples that are wasted. Therefore, Arctic apples not only make convenient snacks, but they also might be able to mitigate a major source of food waste.
While a non-browning apple sounds great, how exactly was this achieved? Arctic apples are genetically engineered (GE) to prevent browning. This means that the genetic material that dictates how the apple tree grows and develops was altered using biotechnology tools. But before learning about the modern science used to make Arctic apples, let’s explore how traditional apple varieties are grown.
How are new apple varieties developed?
Harvesting tasty apples is more complicated than simply planting a seed in the ground and waiting for a tree to grow. In particular, it’s difficult to predict what an apple grown from a seed will look and taste like because each seed contains a combination of genetic material from its parents. But farmers can reliably grow orchards of tasty apples by using an ancient technique called grafting. After a tree that produces a desirable apple is chosen, cuttings of that original tree are grafted, or fused, onto the already-established roots of a donor tree, called rootstock. The cuttings then grow into a full-sized tree that contains the exact same genetic material as the original tree. As a result, each tree of a specific apple variety is a cloned descendant of the original tree, and thus produce very similar apples.
New apple varieties emerge when genetic changes are allowed to occur. Traditionally, new apples are produced by cross-breeding existing apple varieties. This reshuffles the genetic makeup of seeds, which are then planted to see if they grow into trees that produce delicious new apples. On the other hand, Arctic apples are created by making a targeted change to the genetic material of an existing variety (more on this later). The advantage of using genetic engineering over traditional breeding methods is that scientists can efficiently make precise improvements to already-beloved apple varieties—in contrast, traditional cross-breeding is much more random and difficult to control.
What causes apple browning?
Insight into the molecular causes of apple browning guided the genetic alteration that made Arctic apples. Apples naturally contain chemicals known as polyphenols that can react with oxygen in the air to cause browning. This reaction won’t occur, however, without the help of polyphenol oxidase (PPO) enzymes, which bring polyphenols and oxygen together in just the right way. PPO enzymes and polyphenols are normally separated into different compartments in apple cells, which is why the inside of a fresh apple is white or slightly yellow-green in color. But these structures are broken when the fruit is cut or crushed, allowing PPOs to interact with polyphenols and oxygen to drive the browning reaction (Figure 2). This process occurs in all apples, but some varieties are less susceptible than others due to factors like lower amounts of PPOs or polyphenols. Common household tricks can also delay browning by a few hours by interfering with the PPO reaction, but no method prevents it completely or indefinitely. Knowing that PPOs were responsible for browning, researchers thought about blocking the production of these enzymes with genetic tools to create non-browning apples.
How are Arctic apples made?
Genetic material is stored in our DNA and divided into functional units called genes. The genes are “read” by copying the DNA sequence into a related molecule called RNA. The RNA copy functions as a blueprint that instructs the cell how to build the product for that gene, which is called a protein. The production of PPO enzymes, therefore, can be blocked by simply removing their RNA blueprints. To do so, researchers used a tool from molecular biology called RNA interference (RNAi). RNAi is a natural biological process that recognizes and destroys specific RNA structures. Biologists can use RNAi to lower PPO levels by introducing RNA sequences that cause the degradation of PPO RNA. Using this technique, researchers developed an anti-PPO gene that makes anti-PPO RNA, which destroys the PPO RNA before it can be used to make PPO enzymes.
Once scientists created the anti-PPO gene, they needed to safely introduce it into the apple genome. To make a variety called the Arctic Golden, researchers began with Golden Delicious apple buds and inserted an engineered piece of genetic material called a transgene that contained the anti-PPO gene. After confirming that the plant received the transgene, the saplings were then allowed to grow into mature trees, one of which produced the apple that is now known as the Arctic Golden.
Are Arctic apples safe?
After over a decade of research, regulatory agencies in the United States and Canada like the FDA and USDA recently approved Arctic apples for human consumption. Accumulated evidence shows that Arctic apple trees and fruit are no different from their traditional counterparts in terms of agricultural and nutritional characteristics. On the molecular level, the transgene genetic material present in Arctic apples is quickly degraded by your digestive system to the point where it’s indistinguishable from that found in traditional apples. The only new protein in Arctic apple trees—a protein called NPTII that’s used to confirm that the genetic engineering was successful—was not only undetectable in their apples, but it has also been evaluated and deemed nontoxic and non-allergenic by the FDA.
Yet some anti-GMO groups continue to protest the approval of Arctic apples, arguing that unforeseen consequences of the genetic alteration could impact safety. It’s true that it’s impossible to predict and disprove every possible consequence of a genetic change. But a recent review by the National Academies of Science that covers decades of published research found no convincing evidence that GE crops have negatively impacted human health or the environment. While it’s important to rigorously test all new crops that are developed, GE crops should not be considered inherently more dangerous than their traditionally-bred relatives.
So what’s next for the Arctic apple? It takes several years for new apple trees to grow and literally bear fruit, so it’ll take time for non-browning apples to expand to supermarkets throughout the US. Currently, Arctic Goldens are only available in bags of pre-sliced apples in select US cities, but Arctic versions of Granny Smith and Fuji apples have received USDA approval, and Arctic Galas are in development. If commercially successful, non-browning apples could help to combat rampant food waste one slice at a time.

It is so sad that there are probably thousands of genetic differences between the different varieties of apples on the grocery store shelf, yet people have become focused on one relatively trivial gene knock-out. Please keep up the good work; science needs all the good speakers it can get.
i agree with you
I personally would not want to buy or consume the Arctic apple. Since genetic engineering is still so new, the long term effects on human health are still unknown and could be harmful. Humans have a right to be aware of the food they are consuming. Even if genetic engineering has no significant effects on consumer health in its current early stages, mass producing manufacturing companies will eventually take advantage of the increased profits of genetically engineered foods due to the decreased cost of production. Therefore, the freshness and nutritional value of fruits and other foods will continue to decline as a result of genetic engineering. An apple that does not brown due to its PPOs being removed is unnatural. Removing the PPOs from an apple is no different from removing the furniture from a house. A house does not need furniture, but it will no longer be comfortable or appealing without its furniture. To conclude, people will continue to waste food anyway, whether it browns or not. Most people do not save their food and prefer to eat it fresh anyway. Food waste is inevitable, but can be prevented through sustainability, recycling, and composting. Therefore, genetic engineering is unnecessary and will have little impact on improving the environment as a whole.
Your poor biology teachers.
Genetic engineering has been around for millennia in one form or another. Direct genetic modification is still decades old, and there is no reason to believe those methods are any riskier than any other methods.
This includes nutritionally; contrary to the marketing you unquestioningly consumed, there is no nutritional difference between one of those eeeeevil GMOs and its “organic” counterpart.
Your house analogy is deeply flawed. It’s meaningless, because taste doesn’t come from the enzymes. A more apt comparison would be a house without termites.
And yes, yes fruit that doesn’t brown would reduce food waste. Sorry, but it is one of the major reasons fruit gets thrown away. It’s nice that you think everyone can compost their waste food, but leaving aside that absurdity – why is that better than not having to throw it away at all?
Next time, actually try reading an article instead of reacting to it. Failing that, at least establish points using a logical sequence rather than a string of non sequiturs worthy of Natural News.
Hopefully you’ve attended a science lesson since posting this.
While I don’t agree that GMO foods are any different from natural foods from the standpoint of health and nutrition, I think you have touched on two issues that are fair reasons to reject GMO out-of-hand, and that the burden of demonstrating that a GMO food is necessary rather than merely economically viable ought to be included in approving one for release into nature. First, genetic modification is proving to be an economic force that non-engineered foods cannot compete with. Canola, Corn, Beets, Soy, to name a few, are mostly GMO now. If you believe that economics is the only argument, then the discussion stops here. They win. When they are introduced, they will drive other crops out of the market. But behind that is the concentration of economic power in the hands of the patent holders. So long as their economic interests are dominant, then the utility of food crops, ie nutrition, becomes secondary to profit. That is dangerous, because it means famine may become secondary to wealth. The less food, the greater the price. and the greater the profit. But more importantly is the proliferation of the technology. A warning originated from the Asilomar conference in 1975 concerning this. There are two general problems. First, the more broadly this technology is spread, and the more variation there is, and this is especially true in these early days of CRISPR and gene drives, this will enter nature in a dangerous and unpredictable way. It takes little imagination to see what might result. Horizontal spread of toxin genes for example. And the studies that confirm that there has been no damage are necessarily looking at a few indicators of escape and damage, and also at what is being used now, and not at what will be invented. Each new technique and transgene is its own experiment launched on the world we all participate in. So these NAS assurances are quite empty. But moreover, there is a danger of the cumulative effects or synergy among transgenes. It simply isn’t predictable, but it is obviously dangerous. An A-bomb goes off once. Something like a run-away gene drive on newly fertile GMO ground goes off forever. And what is all of this for? So that we don’t waste apples because they look bad? So far what has happened is the appearance of pesticide resistant pests and GMO weeds. That is a tech solution for a psychological problem. Yes, we can feed the world by supercharging the green revolution with GMO. We could also feed the world without it. It would be better to change behavior, because I agree with you. Changing an apple won’t make people less wasteful. Quite frankly I think genetic engineering is full speed ahead for two reasons. Because we can, and because the iceberg hasn’t appeared yet. And money of course. And faith that nothing bad will happen. Faith based science. Another contradiction.
Bananas are genetically engineered
Good shit Allison.
why did u say s***?
because i can..
Yes I’m sure that pesky enzyme causing browning doesn’t need to be there, 😂 God is laughing and thinks we are all so smart. 😑 Keep telling yourself Round up and all their nasty pesticides are fine that Monsanto now Bayer use to grow their toxic corn, soybeans and now apples. I’m sure it’s all healthy, 😉😉
this isn’t about pesticides?? they’re not using pesticides to make the apples non-browning, it’s gene modification, so yeah it IS all healthy
Hey do you have braces? Do you have glasses? Have you ever had surgery? You have a tattoo? Do you straighten or curl your hair? Do you put on makeup? God is laughing and thinks you are so smart. Why would God make you, you if you are going to change that. If god made you like that then why did you have to fix it. Doesn’t he not make mistakes, ok then don’t fix it because your sooooo smart.
good shit allison
Nice piece on Arctic apples, biotechnology is really going far..
that is my mom haha
I am not a science experiment therefore I will not consume a science experiment. Not everything is better man-made. Nature knows better. We are turning our world into a fake toxic world. Science has no place modifying our food. Nature and organic, regenerative practices have mastered our food for a very long time now. We dont need big pharma and industry taking away societies last connection with the earth for more money in their pockets!
then stop drinking water. science has “experimented” on that, purifying it so that we can drink safely. apples brown so that bacteria and fungi have a harder time getting a foothold on the apple. Since this apple isn’t going to be lying on a forest floor at the mercy of countless natural forces, all we did was take it away so that we would have less food waste. nature didn’t know that we would farm apples, reducing the need for this defensive mechanism. arctic apples were thought of and grown by an orchardist, not some giant pharma company or industry. -_- ?
How do you feel about people constantly eating your race?
So what do you like to eat? I’m sure it has been modified in some way.
your opinnion bruh
Good Shit Allison.
why did u say s***
Good stuff Allison.
I don’t know much about apples, but I AM NOW VERY PASSIONATE ABOUT THEM AND IF WE DON’T STOP BROWNING, I CAN NOT GET MY THICC GRAMMY SMITH APPLES from the very sketchy “Farmers Market” across the street from me. SO STOP IT FASTER
Thanks.
Fruit isn’t wasted because of some minor browning, its wasted because people are raised to be childish wasteful twits that take two bites and toss the rest. (evidence is that this applies to all foods not just fruit)
I would also say that culling half the crop is just part of normal production and transport/storage not really “waste”, especially as fruit can be produce in far more abundance than people can eat and considering it is mostly just a source of carbohydrates. Protein is the main limiting factor in production of basic food staples.
That’s because the Arctic apple is the product of complex new genetic engineering techniques that the USDA is just learning how to evaluate. … The Arctic apple has been engineered to silence the polyphenol oxidase (PPO) enzymes responsible for browning in apple flesh after the fruit is cut.
An apple a day keeps the doctor away.
With all this pesticide resistant GMO corn, amazing salmon that grows three times as fast and now apples that don’t turn brown, wow! To think that some hard working folks busted ass just for little ol’ me to have all of this wonderful food. And, they don’t even want credit for it! No bragging about their hard work advertised anywhere on their products. Be proud! What an achievement! Someone’s gone and “fixed” my food for me. Thanks so much! I didn’t even realize that it was broken.
This is a really informative article! Thank you for publishing this, Allison!
hii:)great article
Excellent article! I would have liked to hear more about possible health benefits of eating non-browning foods. What are the chemicals produced during browning and how might they affect health? One example might be oxidized lipids, which are typically not a good thing. (free radicals). There was a nice review article in J Ag Food Chem in the 1996 by Friedman.

The Arctic makes up an essential part of the common cultural heritage, and is home to part of the Kingdom’s population.
The Kingdom and its populations have over several hundred years developed modern and sustainable societies based on democratic principles. The development has affected all sectors of society - from education, health and research to the environment, trade and shipping. At the same time, huge and sweeping changes are taking place today in the Arctic. Due to climate change and technological developments, vast economic potential is becoming more accessible.
With new opportunities come new challenges. The Arctic has to be managed internationally on the basis of international principles of law to ensure a peaceful, secure and collaborative Arctic.
The Kingdom is already a vigorous and important actor in the strategically vital international cooperation on the future of the Arctic and in that connection attaches great importance to creating transparency in and understanding for cooperation.
In the Kingdom’s strategy for the Arctic 2011- 2020, the Government, the Government of the Faroes and the Government of Greenland have set out the most important opportunities and challenges as we see them today and in the near future. On that basis we have defined our common political objectives for the Arctic.
We will – through close cooperation in the Kingdom and with our international partners - work towards the common overall goal of creating a peaceful, prosperous and sustainable future for the Arctic.

Arctic LNG 2 is another LNG production-related project of NOVATEK
The project includes the construction of three LNG trains, with a capacity of 6.6 mtpa of LNG each, and at least 1.6 mtpa of stable gas condensate. The total LNG capacity of the three trains will be 19.8 mtpa. The project employs an innovative construction concept using gravity-based structures (GBS). OOO Arctic LNG 2 is the operator and owner of all the assets.
The Utrenneye field is the resource base for Arctic LNG 2. The field is located in the Gydan Peninsula in YNAO approximately 70 km across the Ob Bay from Yamal LNG.
In 2018, we completed the front-end engineering design (FEED) and started site preparation, construction of early phase power supply facilities, production wells drilling, and construction of the quayside.
The participants of Arctic LNG 2 approved a final investment decision (FID) for the project in September 2019. Capital expenditures to launch the project at full capacity is estimated at $21.3 billion equivalent.
The GBS design concept as well as extensive localization of equipment and materials manufacturing in Russia will allow to considerably decrease the CAPEX per ton of LNG produced under this project. This will ensure a low cost structure of products and maximum competitiveness across the LNG markets.
LNG Construction Center
To provide fabrication of the GBS, assembly and installation of topside modules, we are building the LNG Construction Center in Belokamenka near Murmansk. The Center will comprise two dry docks to build GBS, and facilities to manufacture topside modules. It will set up a state-of-the-art LNG technical basis in Russia, create new engineering and fabrication jobs, and contribute to the economic development of the region.
Competitive advantages
- Decrease in LNG production CAPEX by using GBS
- Onshore conventional reserve base
- Low F&D and lifting costs
- Access to the Atlantic Basin and Asia-Pacific markets
Project status
- Front-end engineering design (FEED) was completed in October 2018
- Final investment decision (FID) made in September 2019
- EPC-contract with TechnipFMC was signed
- More than 90% of equipment for the project was contracted
- At the end 2020, the overall progress for Arctic LNG 2 is estimated at 32%, the first train is roughly 46% completed",,,,,,Arctic LNG 2

The settlement area is divided between eight Arctic countries; Canada, United States, Russia, Finland, Sweden, Norway, Iceland and Denmark. The circumpolar region is extremely sparsely populated. Using more broad definition, according to the University of the Arctic Atlas, there are approximately 13.1 millionpeople livingin the area of the circumpolar North, see the mapIndigenous population in the Arctic.
During the 1950s and 1960s, the number of Arctic people started to grow rapidly because of improved health care for indigenous populations and the discovery of vast natural resources located in North which led to a large influx of immigrants. Recently population growth in the Arctic has slowed down in general and in some cases (e.g. Russian North) the total population has been even declining. It is estimated that two thirds of the total population lives in relatively large settlements. The settlement of the indigenous peoples living in circumpolar countries is characterized by small, widely scattered communities.
Climate change poses a new threat for all of the indigenous peoples
Regardless of underlying causes, the Arctic is undergoing a period of significant change that is likely to continue well into the next century, if not longer, and affect all sectors of the circumpolar North. People in the Arctic are worried about contaminants, land use, climate, security and access in the form of rights to land and sea.
Arctic peoples often point out that their environment has always been dynamic and that constant adaptation to ‘change’ is simply a part of what they do and who they are (Forbes, B.C. Who are the peoples of the North? WWF Circle 2/2010: 6-9).
Climate change significantly impacts the traditional harvesting activities of indigenous peoples. Rapid weather changes and occurrence of thin ice and severe weather conditions (e.g. strong winds and storms) makes hunting more dangerous. Furthermore, disappearing sea ice affects many species that are subject to harvest, for instance polar bears, seals, whales and some fish stocks depend on ice cover. Additionally, the ice plays an important role in sea temperature regulation and primary productivity. As a result, the livelihoods connected with hunting, fishing and herding are under threat. Indigenous peoples have an especially strong bond with nature and the changes in harvesting activities may have implications on the economy, society, culture and health.
Eventually, the survival of many groups as distinctive peoples is endangered. Additionally, housing, infrastructure and transport connections of coastal indigenous communities are seriously affected by climate changes, with rising maintenance costs and sometimes even the necessity of relocation.",,,,Indigenous Peoples,,Uni of Lapland

The Arctic policy of the United States is the foreign policy of the United States in regard to the Arctic region. In addition, the United States' domestic policy toward Alaska is part of its Arctic policy.
Since March 30, 1867 (when the United States purchased Alaska from the Russian Empire), the United States of America has been one of the eight Arctic nations and one of the five Arctic Ocean littoral countries. The United States has been a member of the Arctic Council since its inception in 1996 and assumed the Chairmanship (from Canada) in April 2015. 4 of the Arctic Council's 6 Permanent Participant indigenous organizations have representatives in Alaska. The United States is also an observer of the Conference of Parliamentarians of the Arctic Region.
Since 1880, the global temperature has risen 0.8°C; but the temperature in the Arctic has warmed twice as much, leading to much less sea ice coverage and greater accessibility to natural resources, transport passages and fisheries.[1]
The goals stated in the United States Arctic Policy released in NSPD-66 on January 9, 2009 are as follows: Meet national security and homeland security needs relevant to the Arctic region; Protect the Arctic environment and conserve its biological resources; Ensure that natural resource management and economic development in the region are environmentally sustainable; Strengthen institutions for cooperation among the eight Arctic nations (the United States, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, the Russian Federation, and Sweden); Involve the Arctic's indigenous communities in decisions that affect them; and Enhance scientific monitoring and research into local, regional, and global environmental issues.[2]
On May 10, 2013, the Obama White House released the National Strategy for the Arctic Region, emphasizing three areas: advancing U.S. security interests, pursuing responsible Arctic region stewardship, and strengthening international cooperation.[3]
Canada is the United States' closest partner in Arctic affairs, due to geographic proximity and similar Arctic policy directives. The countries work together on scientific research, including mapping the Arctic sea floor. Two significant disagreements are the border dispute in the Beaufort Sea and the legal designation (international or internal waters) of the Northwest Passage.
Background and history[edit]
The current Arctic policy of the United States has its beginnings under President Richard Nixon. In December 1971, Nixon issued National Security Decision Memorandum 144 to address the United States' stance toward the Arctic. The memo suggested that the development of the United States' Arctic policy focus on three key areas: minimize adverse risks to the environment; promote international cooperation in the Arctic; and provide for the protection of security interests in the region.[4]
In 1984, the United States Congress passed the ""Arctic and Policy Act of 1984"" to provide for the national defense of the region, enhance commercial fishing endeavors, and fund environmental and climate research in the region.[5] The United States remained largely quiet in the international arena with regard to Arctic policy until joining the eight other Arctic countries by signing the Arctic Environmental Protection Strategy agreement in 1991.[6] The main purpose behind this agreement was to coordinate the protection of the Arctic region by: researching the various pollutants in the region and sharing the data; assessing the environmental impacts of development activities; and control pollutants and their effects on the Arctic environment.[6]
In 1996 the United States signed the Ottawa Declaration and became a founding member of the Arctic Council. It added as footnote ""The Arctic Council should not deal with matters related to military security"".[7] The Arctic Environmental Protection Strategy was absorbed into the Arctic Council following the Yalta Declaration in 1997.[8]
In May 2008, five of the Arctic nations adopted the Illulissat Declaration which incorporates the 'law of the sea'. The US has not ratified UNCLOS and is the only Arctic nation yet to join, even though the Clinton, Bush and Obama administrations have all favored ratification.[1]
The Arctic Council was the face of United States Arctic Policy until the latest National Security Presidential Directive (NSPD-66) was signed by President Bush on January 9, 2009.[9] With the diminishment of Arctic sea ice, the increase in human activities in the region, and territorial considerations of the unclaimed Arctic have provided a new sense of urgency to the Arctic issue.[5] This impetus is unique to the United States during this time because of climate change in the region.
While the Arctic Council still remains the authoritative international body on Arctic issues, the United States has started to develop its own strategy toward addressing its resources and claims toward the region. US Arctic Region Policy Presidential Directive, a collaborative effort replacing the Clinton-era Arctic policy directive. NSPD-66 is the official, active Arctic policy being pursued by the Obama Administration and its departments.[10] The policy's international aims are to support the ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), promote participation in the Arctic Council, develop agreements with other Arctic countries on increased human activity in the region, and ""continue to cooperate with other countries on Arctic issues through the United Nations (U.N.) and its specialized agencies.""[9] The policy argues against the need for a treaty among Arctic nations similar to the Antarctic Treaty restricting commercial and military activities. The policy calls for the US to, ""assert a more active and influential national presence to protect its Arctic interests and project sea power throughout the region,"" and to secure free passage of vessels through the Northwest Passage and the Northern Sea Route.[11]
At the March 29, 2010, ""Arctic Five"" meeting in Ottawa, United States Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, criticized Canada for not inviting the other three Arctic nations or indigenous groups. Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister, Lawrence Cannon, said the meeting was not intended to, ""replace or undermine the Arctic Council"".[12]
The diminishment of Arctic sea ice has provided the strongest impetus for a more assertive United States policy in the Arctic region. The United States focuses on numerous facets of the Arctic region in promoting and explaining their reasoning for a stronger policy position in the region. As an Arctic country with territory at stake, the United States is continuously pushing for a larger influence in the region to pursue industry and energy development considerations. One of the tenets of NSPD-66 is the ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), this would provide clarity and the appropriate framework for the United States to submit a claim to some area of the Arctic as the sea ice continues to melt.[13] In addition, new passageways in commercial shipping may become available due to the breaking of ice.
The population influx in the Arctic region is also predicted to coincide with more commercial shipping, marine tourism, and the transportation of large passenger vessels.[14] This poses coverage gaps to the US Navy and US Coast Guard search and rescue functions. Due to the non-military nature of the Arctic Council, the United States will also need to pursue separate military agreements with other Arctic countries to ensure a protected and secure region.[15] In 2019 United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo stated that circumstances had changed for the Arctic Council as ""the region has become an arena for power and for competition. And the eight Arctic states must adapt to this new future"".[7]
United States Executive Agencies Active in Arctic Policy[edit]
The US Arctic Policy Group is a federal inter agency working group comprising those agencies with programs and/or involvement in research and monitoring, land and natural resources management, environmental protection, human health, transportation and policy making in the Arctic. The APG is chaired by the Department of State and meets monthly to develop and implement US programs and policies in the Arctic, including those relevant to the activities of the Arctic Council.
The Interagency Climate Change Adaptation Task Force was initiated by the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ), the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), and NOAA in 2009 and includes representatives from more than 20 federal agencies. President Obama has called on the Task Force to develop federal recommendations for adapting to climate change impacts both domestically and internationally.[16]
In June 2020 the United States reopened its consulate in Greenland, a day after the Trump administration announced that it would build a new icebreaker fleet. Nick Solheim of the Wallace Institute for Arctic Security said that the two acts ""are the most monumental things we’ve done in Arctic policy in the last 40 years"".[17]
Executive Office of the President (White House)[edit]
The EOP is headed by the White House Chief of Staff. Entities within the EOP include: Council on Environmental Quality, National Security Council, Office of Management and Budget, Office of Science and Technology Policy, President's Intelligence Advisory Board, and others.
Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ)[edit]
The CEQ's Interagency Ocean Policy Task Force released its Final Recommendations July 19, 2010. One recommendation was to create The National Ocean Council (NOC), which is co-chaired by the CEQ and the OSTP.[18] The USARC, in conjunction with the Navy and under the aegis of the National Ocean Council, is developing an Arctic Strategic Action Plan.[19]
Office of Science & Technology Policy (OSTP)[edit]
Congress established the Office of Science and Technology Policy in 1976 with a broad mandate to advise the President and others within the Executive Office of the President on the effects of science and technology on domestic and international affairs. The mission of the policy is to ensure that Federal investments in science and technology are making the most out of the contribution to economic prosperity, public health, environmental quality, and national security. It lightens up the process by which government programs in science and technology are resourced, evaluated, and coordinated. Maintain professional relationship between government officials and science representatives.[20] This organization also co-chairs the National Ocean Council.
United States Department of State[edit]
The State Department's Bureau of Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs (OES) includes the Office of Ocean and Polar Affairs (OPA), which is responsible for formulating and implementing US policy on international issues concerning the oceans, the Arctic, and Antarctica. Julie Gourley at the OES is the Senior Arctic Official representing the United States at Arctic Council meetings.[21] In 2011, the OES's Deputy Assistant Secretary David Balton was the lead US negotiator for the Arctic Council's search and rescue initiative.[22] On July 16, 2014, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry announced the appointment of Retired Admiral Robert Papp to Serve as U.S. Special Representative for the Arctic.[23]
In September, 2016, the Department of State's International Security Advisory Board issued a report on Arctic Policy. The report calls for: 1) Continued U.S. leadership in the Arctic; 2) Speedy Law of the Sea treaty ratification; 3) Increased “presence” and “domain awareness”; 4) Increased and continued cooperation among the Arctic nations; 5) Adopting appropriate policies regarding Russian interests, policies, and activities in the Arctic; and 6) Strengthening possible ‘Transparency and Confidence Building Measures’ in the Arctic region.[24]
Department of Defense[edit]
The US Navy's Task Force Climate Change released the Navy Arctic Roadmap in November 2009 and the Navy Climate Change Roadmap[25] in April 2010. (Formerly The Navy had icebreakers, but now uses submarines in the Arctic.) Admiral Gary Roughead believes overfishing and melting sea ice are increasing the importance of the Navy in the Arctic. He also favors the United States ratifying the United Nations Law of the Sea Treaty “so we have a seat at the table’’ and so the United States could “expand its sovereign rights to the increasingly accessible outer continental shelf areas of the resource-rich environment of the Arctic.’’[26] Navy Rear Admiral David Titley was heavily involved in Arctic Policy.[22]
DoD's current arctic strategy[edit]
The latest version of the DoD's Arctic Strategy (2016)[27] defines the following ""ways and means"" in which the DoD will use its resources to achieve its arctic objectives:
- Enhance the capability of U.S. forces to defend the homeland and exercise sovereignty;Strengthen deterrence at home and abroad;Strengthen alliances and partnerships;Preserve freedom of the seas in the Arctic;Engage public, private, and international partners to improve domain awareness in the Arctic;Evolve DoD Arctic infrastructure and capabilities consistent with changing conditions and needs;Provide support to civil authorities, as directed;Partner with other departments, agencies, and nations to support human and environmental security; andSupport international institutions that promote regional cooperation and the rule of law.
The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020 mandates the establishment of a new strategic Arctic port.[28]
Department of Commerce[edit]
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) provides Arctic information and a set of indicators describing the current state of the Arctic ecosystem. NOAA predicts a nearly ice-free summer in the Arctic Ocean before 2050.[29]
NOAA issued its Arctic Vision and Strategy in April, 2010. The Strategy delineates six main goals: to forecast sea ice, strengthen the understanding of science, improve weather forecasts, establish international partnerships, improve the management of coastal resources in the Arctic, and ""advance resilient and healthy Arctic communities and economies.""[30]
Department of the Interior[edit]
The Department of the Interior has arguably the most extensive and diverse set of Federal equities and responsibilities in the region, including protection of wildlife and habitat, federal trusteeship for Alaska Natives, and leasing responsibilities for onshore and offshore areas suitable for mineral development and production. The total federal lands estate in Alaska is nearly equal to the combined area of Texas and Wyoming, all managed by Department of the Interior bureaus including the Bureau of Land Management, the US Fish & Wildlife Service, and the National Park Service. President Obama's Executive Order 13580[31] created the Interagency Working Group on Coordination of Domestic Energy Development and Permitting in Alaska[32] chaired by the Deputy Secretary of the Interior and including many federal agencies. Part of the Working Group's mandate was to develop ""a framework for making integrated Arctic management decisions"" and present a report to the President by 12.31.12.[33] The report, titled ""Managing for the Future in a Rapidly Changing Arctic"" included input from industrial and commercial stakeholders, the State of Alaska, Tribal governments and Alaska Native organizations, municipal governments, conservation organizations, and federal agencies. The report was released to the public in March 2013, and called for sustained high-level leadership from the White House on integrated Arctic management; a strengthening of key partnerships in the region with the State of Alaska and Alaska Native tribal governments and organizations; improved stakeholder engagement in important decision processes in the region; and more coordinated, streamlined federal actions in regard to science and management, environmental evaluations, and important cultural and ecological areas. The report was well received by the full spectrum of stakeholders in the region, many of whom made statements of support for this ""call to action on a pressing issue of national importance."" Alaska Senator Mark Begich described the report as ""required reading for every member of Congress"".[34]

Department of Homeland Security[edit]
The Coast Guard is a large player in Arctic maritime affairs.[38] On May 21, 2013 the ""U.S Coast Guard's Vision for Operating in the Arctic Region"" was released. The report is subtitled ""Ensure safe, secure, and environmentally responsible maritime activity in the Arctic.""[39]
National Science Foundation[edit]
The Office of Polar Programs (OPP) manages National Science Foundation funding for basic research in the Arctic and the Antarctic. The funds are provided as NSF grants to institutions to find any substantial results. OPP supports individual investigators or research teams and U.S. participation projects. Projects can involve investigators from many broad perspectives. OPP has two science divisions one each for the Arctic and the Antarctic. A third division manages the provision of logistic, support operations including field stations, camps, and laboratories. The United States is a leading nation in polar science, and research results have global significance.[40]
Other U.S. executive agencies active in Arctic policy[edit]
The Department of Energy deals with pipeline issues and energy efficiency in Alaska.[41][42]
The U.S. Department of Agriculture is active in Alaska through USDA Rural Development[43] and the Rural Utilities Service.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Region 10 covers Alaska.[44]
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services includes the Indian Health Service: Alaska Area.[45] Erosion and the melting of permafrost continue to present challenges. Some native villages are being forced to move, and the culture continues to evolve due to the changing landscape and the continuing migration of food sources.
The secretary of the U.S. Department of Transportation chairs the Committee on the Marine Transportation System (CMTS), a Cabinet-level partnership of Federal departments and agencies with responsibility for the Marine Transportation System. Public comment on the CMTS U.S. Arctic Marine Transportation System Draft Report was closed April 22, 2013. A final draft is being developed for consideration by the CMTS Coordinating Board.[46]
United States Senate[edit]
Senator Lisa Murkowski (Alaska)[edit]
Senator Lisa Murkowski is a strong proponent of ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. She introduced three Arctic bills in the 111th Congress:[47]
- Legislation to implement some of the Arctic Marine Shipping Assessment recommendations, including a study on infrastructure needed for increased Arctic maritime transportation; and construction of two new heavy icebreakers to replace the aging Polar Sea and Polar Star.
- Legislation amending the Hydrographic Services Improvement Act to authorize funding to get data and services to the Arctic for safe navigation, delineation of the US-extended continental shelf, and for monitoring of coastal changes.
- Legislation to study the feasibility, location and resource needs for an Arctic deep water port.
After participating in the 10th Conference of Arctic Parliamentarians in Iceland, Senator Murkowski sent a letter to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in September 2012 suggesting that they work together to designate ""a senior political official to serve as the United States' Ambassador of the Arctic."" The letter also calls for: strengthening the Arctic Council so that the Council will be viewed by non-Arctic entities as the primary forum for Arctic cooperation; greater participation by Arctic indigenous peoples in the Council's work; and greater engagement by non-Arctic nations like Singapore, Japan, China and South Korea.[48]
Senator Mark Begich (Alaska)[edit]
On August 3, 2009, Sen. Begich introduced the Inuvikput Package of Senate Bills 1560–1566:[49]
- Arctic OCS Revenue Sharing Act: Share potential federal revenues from offshore oil & gas development with the State of Alaska and residents most affected by development
- Arctic Marine Shipping Assessment Implementation Act: Implement the Arctic Marine Shipping Assessment
- Arctic Science, Coordination, and Integration Act: Have the National Research Council study long-term Arctic research strategies and coordination
- Arctic Ambassador Act: Appointing a US Ambassador to the Arctic
- Arctic Oil Spill Research & Recovery Act: Have the Sec. of Commerce research improved methods of oil spill prevention and response in the Arctic and require the Coast Guard to access and reduce risk from Arctic spills
- Better Health in the Arctic Act: Initiate a study into Arctic health problems, institute an Arctic Health assessment program at CDC and create an ""Arctic desk"" at the National Institute of Health.
- Arctic Climate Change Adaptation Act: Help the State of Alaska, Native organizations, and Arctic communities adapt to impacts of climate change
State of Alaska[edit]
Governor of Alaska[edit]
Because Alaska makes the United States an Arctic nation, the state is directly involved in much Arctic research, security, and policy. 90% of the state-funded portion of the budget comes from oil tax revenue—the fisheries industry is also very significant.
Governor Parnell delivered a speech at a US Senate field hearing on Alaska's role in U.S. Arctic Policy on August 20, 2009.[50] The Climate Change Sub-Cabinet (created in 2007) advises the Governor on Alaska climate change strategy.[51]
The Alaska Arctic Council Ad Hoc Working Group is chaired by the Alaska Governor's DC office and includes representatives of the US Department of State, the State of Alaska, Native organizations, universities, the private sector, non-governmental organizations and federal agencies in Alaska. It meets monthly and provides a consolidated Alaskan viewpoint on Arctic issues to the Department of State and other federal policymakers and keeps Alaska informed of US policy issues in the Arctic and Arctic Council affairs.
State of Alaska administrative departments[edit]
The Alaska Region, with USGS and Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation, hosts the Alaska Climate Change Executive Roundtable, a coalition of senior level executives of both federal and state resource management agencies from throughout Alaska that has been meeting regularly since the Climate Change Forum for Alaska in February 2007 to share information and facilitate cooperation among agencies.[52]
The Alaska Department of Fish & Game assists with Arctic Policy in the concerns of Marine Environment Protection in the area of policy dealing with scientifically supported work groups. This department assists in controlling the amount of fishing to be done and when a season is to be opened or closed to protect the population of marine life.
The Alaska Department of Natural Resources' Division of Coastal and Ocean Management closed operations in July 2011.[53]
The Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation's Division of Spill Prevention and Response (SPAR) works on the prevention, preparedness and response of oil spills within Alaska, including Arctic areas of the state. This team also assists in the conservation of arctic flora and fauna, protection of marine life, and sustainable development through the monitoring of oil.[54]
The Alaska Department of Commerce, Community and Economic Development's Division of Community and Regional Affairs (DCRA) actively provides various forms of assistance to Alaskan residents, most notably in smaller villages including those in Arctic regions.[55]
Alaska legislature[edit]
The Alaska Northern Waters Task Force (NWTF) was tasked with facilitating the creation of a joint federal-state entity to coordinate US and Alaskan interests that result from the warming of the northern oceans. The Task Force released its final report January 2012. Per the Task Force's recommendation, the Alaska Arctic Policy Commission was legislatively created April 2012, and held its first meeting March 23, 2012 in Juneau. The Commission will carry on the work of the NWTF in more detail, and create an actionable Arctic policy for Alaska.[56][57][58]

Interagency Arctic Research Policy Committee (IARPC)[edit]
IARPC (U.S. Interagency Arctic Research Policy Committee) consists of fifteen-plus agencies, departments, and offices across the US federal government and is chaired by the National Science Foundation. The IARPC agency helps set priorities for the future of Arctic research. IARPC develops the US Arctic Research Plan and coordinates US research programs to support US Arctic policy. They work with Arctic Research Commission to formulate national Arctic research policies, discuss research programs and details for funding support. They write the five-year plan to implement national policy and responsible for the updates in policy. Coordinate multiagency budget documents and promote cooperative Arctic scientific research program. IARPC submits yearly accomplishments report to the congress.[59]
United States Arctic Research Commission[edit]
The US Arctic Research Commission was established by an Act of 1984 (as amended, Public Law 101-609). Commission's main purpose is to establish the national policy, priorities, and goals necessary to construct a federal program plan for basic and applied scientific research with respect to the Arctic, including natural resources and materials, physical, biological and health sciences, and social and behavioral sciences and to recommend Arctic research policy, and to communicate our research and policy recommendations to the President and the Congress. They also work with National Science and Technology Council as a responsible agency that support cooperation and collaboration through Federal Government. Commission's also gives guidance to (IARPC) in the development of Arctic research projects. They also work on international level by interacting with international research organizations to obtain broadest view of Arctic research.[60]
There are total seven commissioners appointed by the President. Four members are from academic institutions, two members are from private commercial activities in the Arctic and one member is the resident of the US Arctic. The Commission staff consists of an Executive Director, communication Specialist and Deputy Executive director. The Commission appoints advisers on as needed basis to advise on particular research projects. The Commission holds meetings and public hearings in Alaska to receive input. They also make site visits and field trips to the research facilities to acquire knowledge about ongoing projects.

Arctic Research Consortium of the United States (ARCUS)[edit]
The Arctic Research Consortium of the United States was formed in 1988 to identify and bring together the human and facilities resources of the Arctic research community in the United States. ARCUS makes foundation for important research, produces scientific reports with research community recommendations for arctic science priorities, and distributes information to the community. The purpose of ARCUS is to strengthen the foundations of Arctic research by providing leadership in advancing knowledge. It serves as a forum for planning studies of Arctic research, acting as a synthesizer of the scientific information relevant to geographical location and encouraging the public to attain more scientific education that will provide more opportunities of research in Arctic. ARCUS is a non-profit corporation consisting of institutions organized and operated for educational, professional, or scientific purposes. The ARCUS headquarters and staff are located in Fairbanks, Alaska.[61]

Arctic natural resources[edit]
The Arctic contains significant deposits of precious minerals, timber, and fish. Research plans to determine the extent of the US Outer Continental Shelf and the amounts of resources it contains is a primary directive of the US Arctic policy delineated in NSPD-66.[62]
Environmental protection and conservation of natural resources[edit]
The Arctic environment is unique and changing. Despite the heavy research, the Arctic is still poorly understood. The need for sound scientific and socioeconomic information, Arctic environmental research, monitoring, and vulnerability assessments are top priorities. These priorities include sea ice and glaciers, thawing permafrost and coastal erosion, as well as the pollutants from the Arctic contaminating the region. As the temperature rises, contaminants locked in the ice and soils will be released into the air, water, and land. The increased human activity in the Arctic will lead to an increase of contaminants.
NSPD-66 policy states that for ""environmental protection and conservation of natural resources, the Secretaries of State, the Interior, Commerce, and Homeland Security and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, in coordination with heads of other relevant executive departments and agencies, shall respond effectively to increased pollutants and other environmental challenges; continue to identify ways to conserve, protect, and sustainably manage Arctic species and ensure adequate enforcement presence to safeguard living marine resources; seek to develop ways to address changing and expanding commercial fisheries in the Arctic; and intensify efforts to develop scientific information on the adverse effects of pollutants on human health and the environment and work with other nations to reduce the introduction of key pollutants into the Arctic.""[63]
Oil and natural gas[edit]
The United States Geological Survey estimates that 22 percent of the world's oil and natural gas could be located beneath the Arctic.[64] The estimate of oil availability to the US is in the range of 30 billion barrels while that of natural gas reserves could be 221 billion cubic feet.
Fisheries[edit]
The range of some sub-Arctic fish stocks is likely to extend into Arctic areas due to climate change, and decreasing ice-cover will likely lead to more fishing activity. Scientific understanding of Arctic fish populations is limited and needs to be studied before increased Arctic fishing occurs.
In May 2008, President Bush signed a joint resolution passed by Congress relating to Arctic Fisheries. The resolution stresses the need for the United States to work with other nations to conserve and manage future Arctic fisheries.[65]
The NSPD-66 states,""The United States supports the application in the Arctic region of the general principles of international fisheries management outlined in the 1995 Agreement for the Implementation of the Provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of December 10, 1982, relating to the Conservation and Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks and similar instruments. The United States endorses the protection of vulnerable marine ecosystems in the Arctic from destructive fishing practices and seeks to ensure an adequate enforcement presence to safeguard Arctic living marine resources.""[63]
The Arctic to north of the Atlantic, extensive commercial fisheries and international managerial mechanisms already exist. North of the Bering Strait, there are currently no significant commercial fisheries and no international management mechanisms.
The Arctic Fishery Management Plan went into effect December 3, 2009, closing the Arctic Management Area to commercial fishing.[66]

With ongoing COVID-19 travel restrictions worldwide, the Arctic Council has decided on a hybrid event for the upcoming ministerial in May.
Representatives of the eight Arctic States and six Arctic Indigenous groups will attend in person. Everyone else will be able to attend virtually.
“Iceland is preparing for minimum in-person attendance and an extensive virtual platform that will allow a broad audience to participate remotely,” the forum said in a news release on Thursday after the final Senior Arctic Official’s plenary meeting in Reykjavik.
Foreign minister praises forum’s ability to adapt
The Arctic Council is an international forum that focuses on environmental protection and sustainable development in the North. The chairmanship rotates through the eight Arctic states every two years.
The biennial ministerial meeting is where the leadership is officially handed over, and when updates are given on projects from the forum’s six working groups. The working groups are made up of experts from around the world and examine issues ranging Arctic contaminants to emergency response in the Arctic.
Year formed: 1996
Arctic Council Members: Canada, Denmark (Greenland), Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Russia, United States
Permanent Participants: Aleut International Association, Arctic Athabaskan Council, Gwich’in Council International, Inuit Circumpolar Council, Russian Association of Indigenous Peoples of the North, Saami Council
Current Chair: Iceland (2019-2021)
Upcoming Chair: Russia (2021-2023)
In May, current chair Iceland will hand the Arctic gavel over to Russia.
Iceland’s four chairmanship priorities were the Arctic marine environment, climate and green energy solutions, people and communities of the Arctic, and a stronger Arctic Council. And although COVID-19 challenged the forum’s work, Iceland said it’s proud of what it accomplished.
“Covid-19 has affected our Chairmanship, but despite some delays in projects and postponed events and meetings, we were able to adapt quickly,” Iceland’s Foreign Minister Gudlaugur Thor Thordarson said.
“We have carried out most of our plans, including a virtual version of the Plastics Symposium and we launched an online format of the Council’s new marine cooperation initiative. The collaborative efforts demonstrate that the Arctic Council is adaptable, solutions-oriented and open minded when faced with a crisis.”
The upcoming ministerial will take place on May 20 in Reykjavik.

Arctic and Antarctic Sea Ice: How Are They Different?
We often get questions from readers about Earth’s sea ice in the Arctic and the Antarctic, and the differences between those areas. Arctic sea ice has declined over the past five decades, while Antarctic sea ice has increased, and then declined. Why do they behave differently?
How They’re Different
The primary difference between the Arctic and Antarctica is geographical. The Arctic is an ocean, covered by a thin layer of perennial sea ice and surrounded by land. (""Perennial"" refers to the oldest and thickest sea ice.) Antarctica, on the other hand, is a continent, covered by a very thick ice cap and surrounded by a rim of sea ice and the Southern Ocean.
The Arctic Ocean is very deep and closely linked with the climate systems around it, making it more sensitive to climate changes than Antarctica.
During the centuries of human exploration in the Arctic, sea ice covered the Arctic Ocean well year-round, up until recent decades. But satellite observations show that Arctic sea ice has been declining in extent*, thickness and volume since 1979.1 Average Arctic sea ice extent is at its lowest since 1850.
During the summer melt season, the sea ice’s edge retreats toward the North Pole, only to re-grow during the Arctic winter. As a result of ongoing warming driven by human activities, the trend toward summer sea ice loss (from July to September, followed by a winter re-growth) continues.
Recent research suggests that there is a relationship between Arctic sea ice losses and the human burning of fossil fuels in all months.2 Aerosols (tiny particles suspended in the atmosphere) tied to human activities have offset some of the Arctic sea ice extent loss trend; a reduction in aerosol pollution will likely see a sea ice loss acceleration.3 Ice loss at the sea ice’s margins** results in winds driving warmer water beneath the Arctic sea ice, increasing the amount of heat the Arctic Ocean stores 4 and priming conditions for further sea ice loss.
A figure showing current Arctic sea ice extent can be found here.
Antarctic Sea Ice
Antarctic sea ice expands during the winter, only to melt back largely to the continent’s edge in summer.
Antarctic sea ice extent is currently below the long-term average of all decades prior since 1979. Previously, Antarctic sea ice extent had been above that long-term average due to long-term, large-scale wind circulation patterns that drove sea ice away from Antarctica5, making room for more sea ice to form nearer to the continent.6 Climate models, or computer simulations that incorporate all the factors that affect Earth’s climate, predicted this behavior.7 These long-term wind patterns reversed several years ago, resulting in a significant sea ice decline surrounding Antarctica. Values since then have been hovering around the average of all years prior in the satellite record. A figure showing current Antarctic sea ice extent can be found here.
Why Sea Ice Matters
Some of the questions we receive ask why we should care about the polar regions. These regions are very important in regulating global temperature. Because sea ice has a bright surface, 50-70 percent of incoming energy is reflected back into space. As sea ice melts in the summer, it exposes the dark ocean surface. Instead of reflecting 50-70 percent of the sunlight, it absorbs 90 percent of the sunlight. As the ocean warms, global temperatures rise further.
Also, what happens in the polar regions doesn’t stay in those regions. Their changes affect global temperatures and can even change ocean circulation. Earth’s sea ice is very attuned and responsive to even small changes in global surface and ocean temperatures.

Temperatures are skyrocketing, sea ice is dwindling and many experts believe the far north is quickly transforming into something unrecognizable.
This week, new research confirms that a new Arctic climate system is, indeed, emerging.
In fact, some aspects of the Arctic climate have already changed beyond anything the region has experienced in the past century. Sea ice extent has shrunk by 31% since the satellite record began in 1979. Patterns in ice coverage today have dropped beyond the bounds of anything that would have been possible just a few decades ago.
By the end of the century, if global temperatures continue to rise unchecked, other key elements of the Arctic climate—including air temperatures and precipitation patterns—could also be profoundly different from the former 20th-century “normal.”
Study co-authors Laura Landrum and Marika Holland, researchers at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Colorado, published their findings yesterday in the journal Nature Climate Change. The study, they say, is among the first to examine the timing of the emerging new Arctic—the point at which climate conditions fall outside even the furthest boundaries of what was previously “normal”—across both sea and land.
“The changes are so rapid and so large that the Arctic [has] warmed so significantly that its year-to-year variability is moving outside the bounds of past fluctuations, signaling a transition to a new climate,” Landrum told E&E News.
Landrum and Holland used large ensembles of climate models to investigate how the Arctic climate has changed over the last century and what kinds of changes may be in store over the next 100 years. Looking into the future, they focused on a severe hypothetical climate scenario—a trajectory many scientists think of as the worst-case scenario if human societies do nothing to curb their greenhouse gas emissions.
The researchers specifically examined changes in Arctic sea ice extent, air temperatures and precipitation patterns.
Sea ice, they found, has already declined beyond the bounds of anything that would have been seen even a few decades ago. In other words, at least one signal of the new Arctic—driven by climate change—has already emerged.
And sea ice declines will only get worse as time goes on. Under the extreme climate scenario, summer sea ice extent will fall below 1 million square kilometers—a threshold so low most scientists consider the Arctic Ocean “ice free” at that point—by the 2070s at the latest, and potentially decades earlier.
Air temperatures are likely to cross the threshold by the middle of this century, with fall temperatures changing the fastest. Changes in precipitation—namely, a transition from snow to rain—will represent a new Arctic shortly afterward.
That makes sense, considering the way different aspects of the Arctic climate system are linked.
Sea ice can have a profound effect on Arctic temperatures. Ice has a bright, reflective surface that helps beam sunlight away from the Earth. Thick sea ice also helps insulate the ocean, trapping heat below the surface in the winter and preventing it from escaping into the cold Arctic air.
As sea ice thins and disappears, the ocean is able to absorb more heat in the summer. And in the winter, that heat is able to escape through the thinner ice and warm up the atmosphere.
“You would expect ice to play a role in warming the temperature because of these feedbacks,” Landrum said.
The rising temperatures, in turn, help speed up the transition from snow to rain.
The findings confirm that a new Arctic is already emerging—and that if global temperatures keep rising at their current pace, the transformation to an unrecognizable climate system could be complete before the end of this century.
It’s a clear sign that climate change isn’t a problem for the future—it’s already dramatically reshaping the planet today. It’s also a huge concern for the Arctic ecosystem and the human communities that rely on it.
A new Arctic will be warmer, rainier and substantially less frozen. Animals that used to be common may disappear, while new species may move in to take their place. Opportunities for hunting and fishing by sea ice could dwindle. Shipping in the Arctic Ocean may significantly increase as the ice disappears.
Meanwhile, planning for disasters may be an increasingly difficult task.
Community planners often design infrastructure, made to last a certain number of years or withstand a certain level of stress, by looking at past weather observations. But as the Arctic climate transforms, the past is no longer a good predictor of what to expect in the future.
“We’re entering a period where the previous observations we have do not and cannot describe the time that we’re entering,” Landrum said.
While the study provides a grim snapshot of a possible future, it’s not necessarily inevitable. Other studies have indicated that a more moderate climate scenario—one in which world nations substantially reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the coming decades—could stall or prevent some of these changes.
But the research does demonstrate that immediate action is needed.
“For those living in the Arctic—whether it’s human, animal, plant—climate change is not something in the future,” Landrum said. “It’s something that’s happening now.”

Beijing has long regarded the Arctic as consequential to its strategic, economic and environmental interests. China also believes that, in line with international legal treaties — especially the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and the Spitsbergen Treaty — it enjoys such rights as scientific research, freedom of navigation, and overflight, fishery, cable-laying and resource development in the Arctic high seas.
Even before the Arctic policy was unveiled, Beijing gradually expanded its footprint in the region. Notably, since 1999, the Chinese have conducted numerous Arctic expeditions and built their first research base, the Yellow River Station on Svalbard Island in 2004. Generally, China’s current policy involves the acquisition of knowledge about the region; protecting, exploiting and participating in the management of the Arctic Ocean; safeguarding the international community’s common interests; and promoting its sustainable development in the region.
China’s better-known Arctic activities are primarily economic, especially energy cooperation with Russia. As part of Beijing’s effort to wean off coal dependence for power generation and to bolster energy security, in December 2019, it inaugurated the 3,000-kilometer-long “Power of Siberia” natural gas pipeline linking Russia’s Siberian fields to northeast China. Chinese companies also play key roles in the Arctic LNG 2, the second major natural gas project currently under development in the Russian Arctic.
Energy aside, China’s collaboration with Russia on establishing a global transport corridor via the Northern Sea Route, or NSR, has in recent times seized no small amount of attention. Experts believe this route would be around 40 percent faster than the same journey via the Suez Canal, significantly slashing fuel costs. With global warming and the consequent opening up of more ice-free periods per year, the prospect of opening up international Arctic shipping via the NSR becomes brighter.
In order to make the NSR safe and commercially viable, Russia envisaged a network of port terminals and logistics centers along the route, which would therefore require massive investments beyond what Moscow’s limited coffers can offer. In this respect, China’s Belt and Road Initiative becomes an attractive proposition when it comes to the promise of major funding for infrastructure development, with Russian President Vladimir Putin seeking the inclusion of the NSR as part of China’s 21st Century Maritime Silk Road under the “Polar Silk Road” notion.
Still, questions about the slower speed of transit through ice, the need for ice-class vessels that also adds costs, and unpredictable transit times for just-in-time shipping as well as shallow waters dominating the Russian coast along the NSR led to hesitancy among shipping companies.
Much to China’s ire, Japan’s regional influence is becoming the norm
Japan is continuing to enhance its security presence in Asia and the western Pacific, as the government seeks to counter China’s military activities in the region.
Purely scientific research for mankind?
China’s strategic interests in the Arctic, however, have largely been overshadowed by its economic interests, even though in recent times this aspect has become magnified through the broader geopolitical rivalry with the United States. In a speech at the Arctic Council ministerial meeting in May 2019, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo warned of the dangers of Chinese investment in the Arctic.
Beijing generally believes that Washington is seeking an anti-China containment scheme using the Arctic as another strategic front. Some Chinese scholars and military strategists, for example, viewed the recent U.S. withdrawal from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty and President Donald Trump’s interest in purchasing Greenland as part of the broader U.S. strategy to enhance nuclear deterrence, which could envisage the installation of a network of missile defense and post-INF Treaty offensive missile systems in the Arctic to counter both China and Russia.
It is with this strategic context in mind that China’s lesser known, scientific interest in the Arctic becomes something to scrutinize closely. The numerous Arctic scientific research activities, especially made more prominent by the frequent deployment of an icebreaker, have been particularly interesting. Such expeditions incrementally add new, updated information into China’s expanding knowledge database on the Arctic’s climactic, meteorological, geomagnetic and marine environmental conditions.
To be sure, such expeditions might be easily passed off as purely civilian scientific research that contributes to future economic programs in the region. For example, the first China-Russia joint Arctic expedition in 2016 could be regarded as paving the way for future development of the NSR. And the same could even be said of the Arctic Science Observatory, which was jointly inaugurated by China and Iceland in 2018.
However, over the recent years Beijing has instituted a gradually expanding set of scientific research programs in the Arctic that clearly have both civilian and military applications. Since 2014, the Chinese Academy of Sciences kick-started an Arctic acoustic research program, which has been subsumed within the numerous expeditions to the region and involved placement of sensors for long-term ocean observation. It needs to be noted that China has broad interests in creating ocean observation networks on a global scale. As part of this endeavor, Chinese scientists are enthusiastically exploring underwater acoustic sensor networks, with the Arctic also in mind.
The year 2018, when China unveiled its Arctic policy, was a bumper year for Beijing’s ocean observation program in the Arctic. In August of that year, the ninth expedition installed China’s first unmanned ice station in the region to observe multiple fluxes in the ocean, the sea ice and the atmosphere. The station was described to serve as “an effective supplement [to the research] in the absence of scientific expedition vessels.” The same expedition also utilized for the first time China’s indigenously developed Haiyi underwater glider.
In December 2018, the Chinese Academy of Sciences launched a project for a cloud-based online platform using remote sensing and numerical models. The platform provides open access to Arctic ice, ocean, land and atmospheric data. The following August-September, China’s 10th Arctic research expedition was somewhat special; instead of deploying the workhorse icebreaker Xuelong (or Snow Dragon), the oceanographic research vessel Xiangyanghong 01 made its debut and deployed the indigenous Haiyan underwater glider for ocean observation.
These supposedly civilian, persistent ocean observation activities have inevitably provoked concerns among at least some of the Arctic littorals. For instance, Danish defense intelligence authorities warned in November 2019 that the Chinese People’s Liberation Army is increasingly utilizing scientific research as a means of entering the Arctic, describing such activities as not just a matter of science but serving a “dual purpose.”
The U.S. Defense Department’s annual report to Congress, “Military and Security Developments Involving the People’s Republic of China 2019,” was more specific, stating that China’s “civilian research could support a strengthened Chinese military presence in the Arctic Ocean, which could include deploying submarines to the region as a deterrent against nuclear attacks.”
China’s subtle creep into the Arctic
Chinese scholars believed that through bilateral negotiations with and authorization by the concerned coastal states, maritime user states establishing logistics bases in support of military activities can still be allowed within the former’s exclusive economic zones, so long as these do not interfere with both coastal and user states’ rights and freedoms therein. To date, it is difficult to imagine any Arctic littoral — not even Russia, with whom China has such an unprecedentedly close strategic partnership now — would allow Beijing to do that.
Given the suspicion among Arctic littorals toward Beijing’s intentions, and a rising chorus to prevent militarization of the region, China would most likely proceed cautiously, as it acknowledges difficulties in carrying out military activities without being subjected to backlash from the Arctic littorals and international community, especially where it concerns building military bases in the region, particularly pursuant to Article 9 of the Spitsbergen Treaty.
In the foreseeable future, Beijing is more likely to exploit the inherent rights and freedoms bestowed upon maritime user states by the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea, which would create room for military activities such as exercises and weapons tests on, over and under the high seas in the Arctic.
The deployment of military forces, including submarines, to utilize Arctic shipping lanes has been an idea toyed by the Chinese scholarship community. But because unilateral military activities would be deemed “extremely sensitive,” such operations are conducted under a legal framework of international security cooperation.
The existing Chinese scholarship also outlined possible ways to incrementally expand Beijing’s strategic security footprint in the Arctic:
- Creation of dual-use instead of purely military logistics support facilities.
- Persistent development of polar military technologies, especially through scientific research on the unique climatic and geomagnetic characteristics of the Arctic.
- Training of military personnel capable of operating under extreme cold conditions.
- Provision of humanitarian “public goods” services such as maritime and aeronautical search-and-rescue and disaster relief to Arctic littorals and user states.
In fact, even before unveiling its Arctic policy, Beijing paved the way forward for possible maritime security — possibly military — operations in the Arctic. In June 2017, China unveiled its “Vision for Maritime Cooperation under the Belt and Road Initiative,” which identified the Arctic shipping lanes as one of those “blue economic passages,” stressing the need for efforts to be made to “promote the concept of common maritime security for mutual benefits,” including proposed “joint development and sharing” initiatives such as maritime public services, ocean observation and monitoring networks, marine environmental surveys.
China’s dual-use scientific research activities will likely continue to persist; in the next stage of promoting maritime security cooperation that would presage future deployment of military assets to the Arctic, Beijing is likely to start with “white hull diplomacy,” namely the use of its Coast Guard. This includes possible participation in the Arctic Coast Guard Forum as a way to increase Beijing’s “voice” and its role in managing the Arctic.
It would appear that Beijing is already preparing for such a prospect. In late April, the Chinese Coast Guard conducted a maritime law enforcement exercise, code-named “Deep Sea Defender 2020,” on protecting international undersea internet cables — certainly an area of “common interest” in the Arctic.

Established by the Ottawa Declaration in 1996, the Arctic Council is the preeminent intergovernmental forum for addressing issues related to the Arctic Region. The members of the Arctic Council include the eight Arctic States (Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, the Russian Federation, and the United States). The Arctic Council is not a treaty-based international organization but rather an international forum that operates on the basis of consensus, echoing the peaceful and cooperative nature of the Arctic Region. The Council focuses its work on matters related to sustainable development, the environmental protection; its mandate explicitly excludes military security. Traditionally, the Council is chaired by the foreign minister of the country holding the chairmanship. Its day-to-day work is carried out by the eight Senior Arctic Officials (SAO) and six PP representatives, with input from working groups, expert groups, and task forces. To learn more about the Arctic Council, please visit their website at: www.arctic-council.org .
The United States held the rotating chairmanship of the Arctic Council from 1998-2000 and 2015-2017. More information on the 2015-2017 U.S. Chairmanship and 10th Ministerial Meeting can be found here.
Arctic Science Agreement (2017)
In May 2017, the eight Arctic States signed the Agreement on Enhancing International Arctic Scientific Cooperation during the 10th Arctic Council Ministerial in Fairbanks, Alaska. This is the third legally binding agreement negotiated under the auspices of the Arctic Council. The agreement facilitates access by scientists of the eight Arctic States to Arctic areas that each State has identified, including entry and exit of persons, equipment, and materials; access to research infrastructure and facilities; and access to research areas. The agreement also calls for the parties to promote education and training of scientists working on Arctic matters.
The geographic area, as defined by the Arctic Research and Policy Act of 1984 , covered by this agreement in the United States includes territory north of the Arctic Circle and north and west of the boundary formed by the Porcupine, Yukon, and Kuskokwim Rivers; the Aleutian chain; and adjacent marine areas in the Arctic Ocean and the Beaufort, Bering, and Chukchi Seas.
The point of contact for this agreement for the United States is the U.S. Arctic Research Commission , which can be reached at (703) 525-0113 or info@arctic.gov.
Arctic Marine Oil Pollution Preparedness and Response Agreement (2013)
In May 2013, the eight Arctic States signed the Agreement on Cooperation on Marine Oil Pollution Preparedness and Response in the Arctic during the 9th Arctic Council Ministerial in Kiruna, Sweden. This is the second legally binding agreement negotiated under the auspices of the Arctic Council. The agreement strengthens cooperation, coordination, and mutual assistance among Arctic nations on oil pollution preparedness and response in the region to protect the marine environment. The agreement is helping to forge strong partnerships in advance of an oil spill so that Arctic countries can quickly and cooperatively respond before it endangers lives and threatens fragile ecosystems.
Arctic Search and Rescue (SAR) Agreement (2011)
In May 2011, the eight Arctic States signed the Agreement on Cooperation on Aeronautical and Maritime Search and Rescue in the Arctic during the 8th Arctic Council Ministerial in Nuuk, Greenland (Denmark). This is the first legally binding agreement negotiated under the auspices of the Arctic Council. It coordinates life-saving international maritime and aeronautical SAR coverage and response among the Arctic States across an area of about 13 million square miles in the Arctic. The SAR Agreement will improve search and rescue response in the Arctic by committing all Parties to coordinate appropriate assistance to those in distress and to cooperate with each other in undertaking SAR operations. For each Party, the Agreement defines an area of the Arctic in which it will have lead responsibility in organizing responses to SAR incidents, both large and small. Parties to the Agreement commit to provide SAR assistance regardless of the nationality or status of persons who may need it.

In June, the Trump administration released its first presidential memo on the Arctic, marking a significant step in crafting a strategy for the region of growing interest. The memo called on executive departments to devise a plan to launch three heavy icebreakers by 2029 and establish two domestic and two international support bases. While previous U.S. strategic documents and statements had hinted at shifting policy, the presidential memo brings into direct view two key aspects of the U.S.’s current Arctic policy.
First, the Trump administration’s Arctic policy has been overwhelmingly military in focus, and attention has centered on catching up with Arctic competitors. Congress and now the White House have agreed on the need for six new “polar security cutters” (PSC) to address the U.S.’s icebreaker deficiency, especially vis-à-vis Russia. Russia operates about 40 icebreakers, nine of which are nuclear-powered, and is soon to add almost a dozen more. The U.S. has also upped military exercises across the Arctic to expand operational capabilities. The U.S. Navy conducted its first exercise in the Barents Sea since the 1990s, and U.S. troops alongside NATO allies have continued to participate in large-scale exercises like Arctic Edge and the Norwegian-led Cold Response.
Second, China has held an outsized place in the Trump administration’s approach to Arctic engagement. The 2019 “Arctic Strategic Outlook” mentions China and Russia in pairs and almost the same amount of times, despite the disparate threat each poses. And while the presidential memo did not make a direct mention of it, the “China threat” in the Arctic can be read between the lines: the White House ordered the U.S. government to “evaluate defensive armament adequate to defend against threats by near-peer competitors,” a term the Pentagon uses for both China and Russia. Since 2018, increased Chinese presence in the Arctic has raised red flags in Washington. The completion of Beijing’s new icebreaker Xuelong 2, natural resource investments in Greenland, and signs of Sino-Russian cooperation have evoked fears of an encroaching China in an area Washington sees as outside Beijing’s legitimate sphere of influence. In May, Navy Secretary nominee Kenneth Braithwaite stated, “You’d be alarmed at the amount of Chinese activity off the coast of Norway,” indicating some officials’ attention to Chinese activity up north.
These two aspects seen from the presidential memo—military catchup and a focus on China—form the basis of current U.S. Arctic policy. And they are interlinked. The U.S. has perceived Chinese military threats in the Arctic across multiple domains. The Pentagon’s 2019 annual report to Congress on China’s armed forces devoted an entire page to “China in the Arctic” and drew a direct connection between Chinese civilian research and a “strengthened Chinese military presence in the Arctic Ocean, which could include deploying submarines.” Days after the Pentagon report’s release, Pompeo asked at the Arctic Council, “do we want the Arctic Ocean to transform into a new South China Sea, fraught with militarization and competing territorial claims?” And while China’s icebreakers currently serve non-military purposes, speculation of military applications abounds. The Xuelong has conducted three research missions to collect acoustic modeling data, which commentators note is essential for Arctic submarine development.
This focus on the “China threat” is a new development in U.S. Arctic policy. Obama-era policy, such as the 2013 National Strategy for the Arctic Region and the 2014 U.S. Navy Arctic Roadmap, made no mention of China. The Trump administration’s policy, in contrast, has brought China front and center as Chinese Arctic activities have increased, not unrelated to the overall downturn in U.S.-China relations since the administration began.
The current administration’s focus on the military and China aspects within Arctic policy aside, the U.S. has additional interests and responsibilities that its policy should address moving forward. As the U.S. works to patch security weaknesses, it should address non-military threats as well. The U.S. should reincorporate, for example, climate resilience and Indigenous community development into its Arctic strategy to ensure the wellbeing of local communities. The U.S. should additionally promote stability and a rules-based order by investing in diplomatic capital and regional partners. In this vein, the reopening of the consulate in Nuuk, Greenland, while most directly motivated by military factors, could have the added benefit of deepening diplomatic engagement with allies like Denmark.
U.S. policymakers should also ensure that resources and attention are spent on anticipating all threats, not just those posed by a specific strategic competitor like China. Essential to this is qualifying the urgency of threats posed by all Arctic actors independently. As U.S. Arctic policy matures and sub-strategies develop, the Pentagon and Homeland Security should issue recommendations with the unique interests and on-the-ground capabilities of each strategic competitor in mind. Russia is an Arctic state with great Arctic assets and vested interests, and China poses less traditional challenges to the region. China, for example, only operates two icebreakers and has contracted the construction of a nuclear-powered icebreaker. Considerations of Russia’s overwhelming icebreaking fleet versus China’s smaller fleet can help distinguish the threats posed by each country and illuminate where additional resources are best allocated.
In distinguishing these threats, context will be particularly helpful. Despite the dearth of information on China in the Arctic, it is clear that China does not view the Arctic as its primary theater. While its self-designation as a “near-Arctic” state was heavily criticized by the U.S., it represents the reluctant acceptance of China’s disadvantages in the region. It will be important to reevaluate direct comparisons of the Arctic to the South China Sea – one is seen by the Chinese as an aspiration and the other as a centuries-old issue of reputation and territorial integrity – as a reconsideration of this comparison will help calculate China’s risk tolerance in protecting its Arctic interests.
After many years of unfulfilled budgetary requests, the United States is finally addressing long-standing deficiencies in the U.S.’s security presence in the Arctic. Yet challenges remain. The next steps for policymakers will involve juggling multiple difficult tasks: defining the real challenges in the Arctic, prioritizing policies based on the urgency of threats, and balancing military and non-military responses. A multipronged and nuanced Arctic strategy will best prepare the U.S. to confront the diverse challenges in this arena where multiple great powers are already converging.

As part of the Commonwealth of the Realm of Denmark DMI has a long tradition studying, monitoring and forecasting Greenland’s weather, atmosphere, ocean, ice and climate. Further, climate change is more pronounced in the Arctic than almost everywhere else on the globe. It is therefore important to assess potential future Arctic changes using climate models.
Many lines of research at the DMI are centered around the Arctic. DMI is responsible for forecasting the weather, ocean , ice and wave conditions for Greenland, and thus runs numerical weather, ocean-ice and wave prediction models for Greenland and provides official forecasts. DMI participates in a number of climate studies in the Arctic, including coupled atmosphere -ice sheet modelling as well as ocean and sea ice studies with focus on Greenland fjords, the surrounding waters and the Arctic Ocean.
Atmosphere and ocean climate models are run over numerous Arctic domains and coupled atmosphere, ocean, ice sheet and permafrost models are developed. The arctic stratosphere, which is determining for the ozone layer over the Northern Hemisphere, is a long-standing research area at DMI. Finally, DMI researchers are part of the team behind the outreach web site polarportal.org and take part in several expert groups on short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs) in the Arctic.
Increasing economic activities in the Arctic waters such as maritime transport, offshore oil and gas exploitation and fishery have raised new research challenges such as e-navigation, environmental protection and ice service. Combing modeling, remote sensing and in-situ monitoring, DMI has been actively developing integrated Arctic System science for serving a variety of social benefit areas.

Defrost (Link: www.ncoe-defrost.org)
Project aims: The aim of DEFROST (Impact of a changing cryosphere - Depicting ecosystem-climate feedbacks from permafrost, snow and ice) is to understand how climate change induced changes in the cryosphere influence the ecosystem/geosphere processes which directly affect climate. We will focus on key terrestrial, lacustrine and marine cryospheric components that have the potential for giving rise to substantial changes in climate feedback mechanisms both in terms of surface-atmosphere energy exchange and exchanges of greenhouse gases. DEFROST seeks to bridge existing gaps between climate modeling, cryospheric science, and Arctic ecosystem science.
DMI’s role: Improved parameterisation of permafrost, snow and ice related processes is being incorporated in the existing Regional Climate Models RCA (Sweden), HIRHAM (Denmark) and later in HARMONIE (International). The impact on changes in regional cryospheric/climate scenarios is investigated, beneficial also to the DEFROST user community and in terms of impacts and adaptation, by a provision of more elaborated regional scenarios. A novel element is the implementation of a sub-sea permafrost model in the HIRHAM-HYCOM coupled system for the Arctic based on the GIPL permafrost model develop in UAF in Alaska

ice2ice (Link: coming up. See introduction video)
Project aims: ice2ice is the first concerted effort to the tackle question of the cause and future implications of past abrupt climate change in Greenland, the main hypothesis being that the Arctic and sub-Arctic sea ice cover excerts important controls on past and future Greenland temperature and ice sheet variations. In ice2ice this will be done by:
- describing the nature, timing and wxtent of abrupt events across climate archives,
- resolving mechanisms behind the sudden demise of sea ice cover,
- identifying the risk that the ongoing rapid diminution of Arctic sea ice cover could give abrupt GIS changes in the future,
- determining the impacts of such changes for the GIS and Arctic and global climate.
DMI's role: To further develop and apply global and regional Earth system models to be able to conduct experiments addressing the central question of the project. This involves, high resolution atmosphere modeling, a coupled high resolution regional climate model for the Arctic and using the global EC-Earth model. In most cases with an interactive ice sheet model (PISM) being part of the system. 3 PhD positions will form a central contribution to the project, but substantial funding is allocated to permanent staff at DMI.

SAMAR - Short and long term ablation modelling based on Automatic Weather Station data and Regional Climate Model
Project aims: The overall goal of the project SAMAR is to improve predictive capabilities of surface energy balance (SEB) models both on short time scales (days and weeks), that are useful for example for operation of hydroelectric power plants and for making flood warnings, and on century time scale for improved projections of the contribution of glaciers to sea level rise. To achieve this overall goal we will take advantage of the wealth of data available in Iceland at IES, and three types of ablation models with various spatial extent and resolution. An SEB model that has been applied for points will be extended to a distributed surface module in HIRHAM5. To include the response of the glacier to the changes in the SEB, HIRHAM5 is coupled to the dynamic ice sheet model PISM for future projections. The objectives of the project are defined as follows:
Objective 1: Develop a distributed SEB model for Icelandic glaciers
Objective 2: Assess the sensitivity of the modelled ablation to variation in albedo and other energy balance components in the model
Objective 3: Validate the SEB module of HIRHAM5 with available observations from AWS and contribute to further development of this module
Objective 4: Validate and apply the coupled HIRHAM5-PISM model on Icelandic glaciers on both short and long time scales as well as with different spatial model resolutions
DMI’s role: Improved parameterisation of SEB in HIRHAM and apply the model to Icelandic glaciers using the PISM Ice Sheet model coupled to HIRHAM

One third of Norway is in the north, and around 80 per cent of Norway’s sea areas are north of the Arctic Circle. Map: High North News
Norway’s new High North policy is a complex mix of initiatives and statements. The main rationale is still ensuring a developed northern region so that Norway can stand strong vis-à-vis the great powers in the north. In addition, the policy plays a role in domestic politics ahead of next year’s election.
Last Friday, in a week that began with Northern Norway taking its first premier division gold in football, the Norwegian government presented a new white paper on the High North to the Norwegian Parliament. Various ministers descended on the northern cities of Alta, Bodø, and Tromsø to present work that has been underway for several years: this is the first white paper since 2011.
Any Norwegian government must balance many different interests. The priorities of the ministries in Oslo are not necessarily the same as the wishes of Hammerfest municipality or Nordland county. Vladimir Putin is also paying attention. Many footballs need to be juggled.
If football were an indicator of the situation in the northernmost third of Norway, perhaps such a policy document would be superfluous. But Northern Norway has a number of challenges that require special attention. Not only that; what Norway is doing in the north is also of great importance for both its foreign and security policies and concerns.
Foreign Policy: Norway, the Great Power
The High North, or the Arctic, if you will, is a region influenced by Great Power politics (like everywhere else). Countries outside the region, such as China, France, and India, are looking north, wanting to use the Arctic as an arena for foreign policy influence and symbolic politics. In the Arctic, Norway is seated around the table with countries that are bigger and more powerful, such as Russia, the United States, and Canada. This gives Norway international leverage.
Historically a neglected part of Norway, a trip north is a must when foreign leaders visit Norway today. When Norwegian leaders visit US officials in Washington D.C., the Arctic is on the agenda. This was not the case a few decades ago. The Arctic has become the one part of the world where Norway has considerable clout. Clout in the form of a large population (in an Arctic context). Clout in the form of military presence. And clout in the form of having highly developed economies and societies north of the Arctic Circle.
At the same time, the Norwegian Arctic in 2020 is characterized by security concerns and tension. US leaders have used excessively strong rhetoric about the Arctic situation and warned against both China and Russia in the north. Norway has seen increased military exercise activity along its northern coast, driven by Russia as well as NATO allies. The Norwegian Armed Forces warns about this increased military activity and about China’s increasing espionage and intelligence activity in the High North.
The solution for Norway is to engage its allies, first and foremost the United States, to be active in the maritime domain along Northern Norway. This, in turn, provokes Russia. The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently took a hard line against Norway pursuing an “anti-Russian policy.” This came after a debate had escalated in Tromsø about whether American nuclear submarines should be allowed to dock outside the city. As those skeptical of too much US engagement warn, Russia is also Norway’s neighboring country, with which a constructive relationship is needed.
This is the complex situation in which a new white paper on the High North from the Norwegian government is set. Norwegian Foreign Minister Ine Eriksen Søreide cannot change these dynamics or remove the threats on her own. Norwegian Minister of Defense Frank Bakke Jensen would probably prefer that he did not have to take a position on American nuclear submarines in Tromsø.
What the paper does, however, is to highlight these issues and underscore their complexity. The world is not black and white, not even in the High North. This is communicated in the white paper, which in this way is aimed as much at a foreign audience as a Norwegian one.
At the same time, the paper’s emphasis is not on the foreign and security policy challenges in the north. These are being discussed, but the most significant measures are not found there.
Regional Development: Picking Northern Fruits
The High North white paper is instead about further developing Northern Norway on a regional level, both because the connection between a strong region and foreign policy challenges is obvious and because Northern Norway is in a special position nationally.
Some things are indeed different in the north. The geographical distances between the communities are more vast than in the rest of the country, as exemplified by a crisis that erupted last year over limited access to emergency medical transport. Historically, Northern Norway has been the part of Norway with the lowest value creation per capita. The average is still below the national average, despite the fact that the region is currently experiencing rapid economic growth.
The biggest challenge, however, is the population decline in the north, which in turn will have long-term consequences for the regional economy. Small coastal communities in Northern Norway are still struggling to pivot from the last century’s economy and way of life. This is particularly evident in an ongoing debate over the wealth tax: A small municipality in the north—Bø, in Vesterålen—has drastically cut it to attract inhabitants. This has in turn caused a nationwide debate on the future of peripheral communities contributing to a surge in popularity for the Center party—an agrarian political party focused on decentralization.
Not all places in the north can take part in the growth of the fishing industry or be like Lofoten and make a living from tourism. Even the latter example is not entirely positive: more and more voices are critical of tourism as an economic solution for northern communities. Moreover, a key concern is how Sami culture, language, and self-government will not merely be safeguarded but highlighted and made visible in Norway.
At the same time, Northern Norway has some strengths that differ from the rest of the country. There is much low-hanging fruit that can be picked in the north. The fishing industry is Norway’s future (and historical) economic pillar. The majority of fishing activity takes place in the north, and it looks set to further expand.
Norway’s dawning ambitions in space, satellite, and data technology are linked to what is happening in the north on Andøya and Svalbard. Norway is a world leader in research on oceans, climate, and politics in the north, led by its two Arctic universities: Nord University and UiT: The Arctic University of Norway.
The High North policy is about seeing these things in context and conceiving how and why a competence environment in oil spill response or the Sami language strengthens both Norway as a country and Norway’s position in the Arctic (and the world).
Residents of cities in the south of Norway benefit from the fact that people-to-people cooperation with Russia functions well. Companies in the south benefit from the development of new forms of fish farming along the Finnmark coast. And an Italian in Naples benefits from reduced tensions between NATO and Russia in the north.
Domestic Politics: Into an Election Year
In addition to the international and regional dimensions, the High North policy also concerns domestic politics. With less than one year until the parliamentary election in Norway, a new white paper on the High North must also be read in the political context.
It was the red-green coalition government that in 2005 raised the High North on the national agenda in Norway. Jonas Gahr Støre is still revered as the father of the High North policy, despite the fact that the Labor Party that he leads is struggling nationwide. Earlier this autumn, the Labor Party even presented its own alternative High North report, in which they now refer to the region as “our most important project for peace.”
The current Solberg government has been criticized for letting the air out of the High North balloon when it took office in 2013. It should, however, be mentioned that forces out of its control contributed to this: both oil prices and relations with Russia crash-landed in 2014, months after the new government had moved in.
The 2020 High North paper is this government’s attempt to create its own northern path by placing more emphasis on business and value creation than previous Norwegian white papers and strategy documents. Perhaps this is not so strange, as the political dynamics in the Arctic are more tense than in a long time. At the same time, one would think that this is precisely why foreign and security policy measures are also needed.
The problem is that there are few votes to gain from a white paper on the High North. It is, however, easy to criticize it. Many northern Norwegian mayors, business leaders, and researchers have far-reaching wishes and demands. What about mechanisms to stimulate business? What about tax policy in the north? What about support for new research centers? What about dialogue with Russia? The questions are many, and the white paper does not give many answers.
Concluding Remarks
In sum, Norway’s current Arctic policy white paper boils down to a desire by the current government—especially prime minister Erna Solberg and foreign minister Ine Eriksen Søreide—to show action in the north. Symbolic and real. Sprinkled with domestic political positioning.
The 2020-white paper marks a turn from foreign and security issues in the north towards regional development in Northern Norway. Albeit a welcome shift for those living in the north—which constitute almost 10% of Norway’s population—it does little to address the increasingly tense security situation in the north.
As Norway is uniquely positioned between the East and the West in the Arctic, finding ways to address this situation and related concerns should still be a priority. In any case, the High North will continue to be the part of Norway where local politics meets the world, and regional measures may have foreign policy consequences. That is why Norway has a separate policy for the Arctic.

Climate change has already removed at least 75 percent of Arctic summer sea ice volume at rates never before experienced in human history. Soon, the Arctic Ocean will be like other oceans for much of the year: open water that is exposed to exploitation and environmental destruction.
Despite the Arctic Ocean’s unique vulnerabilities, it is still the least protected of all the world’s oceans. Less than 1.5 percent has any form of protected area status. The high seas of the Arctic — which belong to no single nation — are under no form of protection.
A strong Global Ocean Treaty will enable us to finally protect the Arctic Ocean, as part of a network of sanctuaries.
And we aren’t the only ones who want this: a Greenpeace survey revealed that 74 percent of people across 30 different countries support the establishment of a global sanctuary in the international waters around the North Pole. More than 70 percent of those people believed that the Arctic should be free of oil drilling and other heavy industry.
How do we envision an Arctic Sanctuary?
The Arctic ocean is vast, and its ecosystem depends on that immense size. An Arctic Sanctuary would need to be large as well. The Arctic high seas make up an area the size of the Mediterranean Sea.
Within the Arctic Sanctuary, there would be no fishing, no military activity and no exploration for or extraction of fossil fuels or other minerals from the seabed.
Strict environmental controls would apply to all shipping in this area, although not all shipping activity would be prohibited. Heavy fuel oil use, for example, would not be allowed — a practice that is already adopted in Antarctic waters.
We will be pressuring the international community every chance we get. And our effort in collaboration with many organizations and indigenous peoples’ to collect signatories for an Arctic Declaration in solidarity with Arctic peoples was a big step in this direction.
When we set out to protect the Arctic from destructive oil drilling and commercial fishing people told us it was impossible. Now after years of pushing millions of us have secured an enormous area protected from commercial fishing in the center of the Arctic Ocean, and we’re getting closer every day to an Arctic safe from oil drilling too.",,John Hocevar | May,,,2019-10-09,Greenpeace USA

The arctic tundra is a harsh environment that only the toughest plants and animals can survive in. The habitat has a long and brutal winter and the barren landscape provides many challenges. Below are some really neat facts about the arctic tundra!
Location:
The arctic tundra can be found in the northern parts of North America, Europe, and Asia. Most of the region is found within the Arctic Circle and above the edge of the coniferous forests—latitude 60°N in Canada and Siberia and latitude 70°N in the other countries. While the arctic tundra is confined to only the areas near the north pole, other areas that are part of the tundra biome can be found in Antarctica and certian cold, mountainous regions (alpine tundra).
True to its name, the arctic tundra is part of the tundra biome, which is very large (taking up about 20% of the earth's surface). Unfortunately, the arctic tundra is shrinking as a result of climate change; the increasing temperatures are causing the permafrost to melt.
Characteristics:
The arctic tundra has several distinct features that make it a unique habitat. The permafrost, barren landscape, and cold/dry climate of the arctic tundra are all important characteristics.
Permafrost (Frozen Ground):
NPS Climate Change Response, flickr creative commons, CC BY 2.0
Permafrost melting in the summer
Permafrost is very challenging to build on, which is one of the reasons that very few people inhabit the tundra. In the summer most of the arctic tundra is covered in marshes and bogs because the top soil melts, turning firm, frozen soil into soggy, melted soil. Even on solid ground in the winter, building on permafrost can cause the ground to melt underneath, which disrupts the foundation of the building.
Barren Landscape:
Cold and Dry Climate:
The arctic tundra is the coldest and driest place on the planet. In the tundra the fall and spring seasons are basically non-existent, leaving only two seasons—winter and summer.
Winter – The winter season is incredibly long, about 8 months. Since the arctic tundra is very close to the north pole, the nights are very long. At the deepest points in the winter the sun may be gone for several weeks straight. This leads to the very cold temperatures: with an average of -34°C during the winter and in the coldest days dipping as cold as -45°C. This is not to mention the harsh wind in the barren land, which can add a bitterness that makes the tundra feel even colder.
Brian Romans, flickr creative commons, CC BY-NC 2.0
Summer – The summer season is very short in the arctic tundra (giving plants only 50-60 days to grow each year). The temperature is much warmer and usually ranges somewhere between 3°C and 12°C. A remarkable characteristic of the arctic tundra are the long days of the summer months. At the height of the summer the days last a full 24 hours. If it weren't for this short two month period the arctic tundra would not be a suitable habitat for animals and plants to survive.

In terms of precipitation the arctic tundra recieves approximately 10 inches in a whole year, sometimes even less! The precipitation mostly comes in the form of snow during the winter season; however, there is also the occasional rainy (or even snowy) day in the summertime.
Plants:
Due to the permafrost in the arctic tundra, plants that extend their roots deep into the soil (trees for example) are unable to grow. Despite the barren nature of the arctic landscape and harsh conditions of the tundra biome, there are several amazing plants that call the arctic tundra home.
Plants with shallow roots that sprawl across the ground or can grow on a rocky terrain can survive in the tundra. Lichen is an ideal plant for the tundra because it is able to grow on rocks or other places with very little soil and can withstand freezing temperatures for long periods of time. Interestingly, lichen is a combination of algae and fungus, which act in a symbiotic relationship—the algae is responsible for the photosynthesis and the fungus holds water in the plant in order to survive in the dry climate.

The summer season is incredibly short in the tundra biome, so it is important that plants make the most of the sun. During the summer the wildflowers bloom quickly and beautifully. There are 400 different flowers in the arctic tundra. Most of the flowers that survive in the tundra are perennials; they lay dormant in the cold winters and grow again from the same roots in the summer.
The ground of the arctic tundra is marshy and boggy during the summer, so plants must be able to survive in water-logged areas. Seasonal grass thrive anywhere there is a little bit of soil and enough water. You will often see clumps of grass growing in marshy areas of the arctic tundra.
The barren landscape leads to strong winds that make surviving in the tundra very difficult. Moss will grow in wide and thick clumps, but what looks like a giant plant is actually hundreds of little tiny plants growing closely together. Growing in bundles allows plants to be sheltered from the harsh conditions, so it is an effective adaptation for many plants in the tundra.
Animals:

Different adaptations include:
- being a large animal that is able to retain energy,
- extra layers of fur,
- large paws to help walk over snow and special hooves that can traverse the rocky barren landscape and dig for food underneath the snow,
- storing fat in the body,
- changing the color of fur from brown to white for the winter season,
- small ears and tails to prevent loss of heat.

The arctic tundra also has a rich history for the aboriginal people of North America because the tundra is home to the Inuit peoples. The Inuit people had to make their own adaptaions to living in the arctic tundra. There are many different families and groups of inuits, who are known for different things, for example:
- Copper Inuit – Living in regions with large copper desposits,
- Caribou Inuit – Hunting caribou to sustain life (they were very skilled in using all parts of the animal for food, shelter, clothing, and even tools),
- Nestilik Inuit – Living on the Arctic Coast; Nestilik actually means ""people of the place where there is seal"",
- Igloolik or Iglulik Inuit – Building igloo's for shelter in the snowy landscape,
- Western Arctic (formerly Mackenzie) Inuit – Living near the Mackenzie River.

The seasonal maximum extent of Arctic sea ice has passed, and with the passing of the vernal equinox, the sun has risen at the north pole. While there are plenty of cold days ahead, the long polar night is over. Arctic sea ice extent averaged for March 2021 was the ninth lowest in the satellite record. With little ice in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, harp seal pups are struggling. At month’s end, Antarctic sea ice extent was slightly above average.
Overview of conditions
Figure 1. Arctic sea ice extent for March 2021 was 14.64 million square kilometers (5.65 million square miles). The magenta line shows the 1981 to 2010 average extent for that month. Sea Ice Index data. About the data
Arctic sea ice extent averaged for March 2021 was 14.64 million square kilometers (5.65 million square miles). This was 350,000 square kilometers (135,000 square miles) above the record minimum set in 2017 and 790,000 square kilometers (305,000 square miles) below the 1981 to 2010 average. The average extent ranks ninth lowest in the satellite record, which began in 1979. Regionally, extent at the end of the month was below average on the Pacific side in the Bering sea and on the Atlantic side in the northern Barents Sea and well south of the Arctic in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Elsewhere, extent was close to the average, though generally somewhat lower. Ice loss during March was primarily in the Sea of Okhotsk, the southern edge of the Bering Sea, east of Svalbard, and in the northern part of the East Greenland Sea. The ice edge expanded in the southern part of the East Greenland Sea and to the north of Svalbard.
Conditions in context
Figure 2a. The graph above shows Arctic sea ice extent as of April 5, 2021, along with daily ice extent data for four previous years and the 2012 record low. 2020 to 2021 is shown in blue, 2019 to 2020 in green, 2018 to 2019 in orange, 2017 to 2018 in brown, 2016 to 2017 in magenta, and 2011 to 2012 in dashed brown. The 1981 to 2010 median is in dark gray. The gray areas around the median line show the interquartile and interdecile ranges of the data. Sea Ice Index data.
Figure 2b. This plot shows the departure from average air temperature in the Arctic at the 925 hPa level, in degrees Celsius, for March 2021. Yellows and reds indicate higher than average temperatures; blues and purples indicate lower than average temperatures.
During March, sea ice extent tracked well below average, but as noted in our previous post, the seasonal maximum in extent, reached on March 21, one day after the vernal equinox, was only the seventh lowest in the passive microwave satellite record. Since ice extent in March increases through the first part of the month and then decreases thereafter, the daily average growth rate is not a very meaningful statistic.
Air temperatures at the 925 mb level (about 2,500 feet above sea level) in March were up to 5 degrees Celsius (9 degrees Fahrenheit) below average across northern Eurasia and extending east over Alaska. Temperatures were 1 to 3 degrees Celsius (2 to 5 degrees) Celsius above average over the Atlantic side of the Arctic, with a tongue of above-average temperatures extending into the Beaufort Sea (Figure 2b). The associated atmospheric circulation for March features low pressure over the northern North Atlantic, with the lowest pressure focused over the Barents Sea (Figure 2c). After remaining in a fairly persistent negative phase for much of the past winter, the Arctic Oscillation index in March was mostly positive, but with large fluctuations.
March 2021 compared to previous years
Figure 3. Monthly March ice extent for 1979 to 2021 shows a decline of 2.6 percent per decade.
Through 2021, the linear rate of decline for March sea ice extent, relative to the 1981 to 2010 average extent, is 2.6 percent per decade, which corresponds to 39,700 square kilometers (15,300 square miles) per year, about the size of the US states of Maryland and Delaware combined or the country of Switzerland. The cumulative March ice loss over the 43-year satellite record is 1.67 million square kilometers (645,000 square miles), based on the difference in linear trend values in 2021 and 1979, which is equivalent in size to the state of Alaska.
Troubles in the Gulf of St. Lawrence
Figure 4. A harp seal pup rests on sea ice. Harp seal pups are born with long white fur that helps them absorb sunlight and stay warm while they develop blubber. Pups shed their white fur after about three to four weeks old.
This winter ice extent was far below average in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, which is an outlet for the US Great Lakes located northeast of New Brunswick. The unusually low sea ice extent is leading to the death of many harp seal pups. In December, harp seals arrive at the Gulf of St. Lawrence from the Canadian Arctic and Greenland, and then give birth to pups under snow on the ice cover. With so little sea ice, many pups were forced to cluster on shore where they are vulnerable to predators, leading to high pup mortality. It is widely viewed that with continued warming and loss of sea ice, harp seal populations will decline.
Antarctic sea ice on the rise
Figure 5. Antarctic sea ice extent for March 2021 was 4.45 million square kilometers (1.72 million square miles). The magenta line shows the 1981 to 2010 average extent for that month. Sea Ice Index data. About the data
After reaching its seasonal minimum extent on February 21, Antarctic sea ice extent climbed rapidly, passing the long-term average daily extent on March 1. The rate of growth was very rapid between February 25 and March 8, expanding by over one million square kilometers (386,000 square miles) in the 12-day period. This is the fastest expansion in the four-decade record of sea ice extent for this time of year, and was caused by a rapid refreezing of the western Amundsen Sea and eastern Ross Sea areas. Since early March, growth has slowed to a more typical, slightly below-average pace. The Amundsen and eastern Ross Seas remain well above the average extent for the season. Sea ice extent in the Bellingshausen Sea and Weddell Sea are slightly below average. At the end of the month, Antarctic ice extent neared 5.5 million square kilometers (2.1 million square miles).",,,Analysis,,2021-04-06,Sea ice data updated daily with one-day lag

The United States and Russia have disagreements on many issues, including the organization of the international system. No “reset” in relations is in sight but there is a need to put a floor in the relationship and work on possible areas for cooperation. The Arctic can be one.
The Russian Arctic town of Verkhoyansk recently set the unenviable record of having the first recorded temperature above 100 Fahrenheit. Record warming and its impacts come as the Arctic is increasingly seen as another venue where broader geopolitical tensions between the United States and Russia (and China) are playing out. Recent reports of Russian bounty payments on the U.S. military in Afghanistan have raised these tensions to new heights. Nonetheless, the US should be open to areas where constructive cooperation in our interest with Russia can be maintained. The Arctic is one if near term opportunities for statesmanship can be seized.
The consequences of Arctic thawing include permafrost and infrastructure damage, large losses of summer sea ice, a migration of species and pests to the North, and detrimental impacts on the way of life of Arctic Indigenous communities. Coupled with the health impacts of the coronavirus on small, poorly served and isolated communities, the Arctic has been hit by a collapse in shipping, falling oil and gas prices, stoppages of energy and mineral exploration, and a tourism industry that will take years to recover. These challenges are interlocking, global in impact, and they are not subject to short-term amelioration.
Russia and China are now viewed as strategic competitors by the United States. There are increased levels of Russian military activity in the Arctic, new Arctic Ocean sea routes such as the Northern Sea Route above Russia are opening with accompanying strategic issues, and the vast Arctic energy and raw material resources remain to be exploited.
Until recently, the Arctic appeared to be a region where scientific and other peaceful cooperation seemed an exception to broader geopolitical tensions. Scientific research and environmental action under the auspices of the eight-member state Arctic Council and its six Indigenous Permanent Participant organizations were producing excellent results buttressed by the consensus that the effects of climate change and rapid ice melt were too large for any one country to manage and that science-based diplomacy and cooperation were best to resolve or at least manage the looming issues. Prohibited from examining hard security issues, the Arctic Council facilitated the convening of a Coast Guard Forum to deal with search and rescue missions in the infrastructure-poor Arctic Ocean and a separate Arctic Security Forces Roundtable brought U.S. and Russian military representatives face to face.
The situation began to change after Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea, military support of separatism in eastern Ukraine, and shoot-down of a Malaysian civilian airliner over the conflict zone. Relations with Russia nosedived, and the Arctic was impacted by U.S. economic sanctions which prevented American firms from participating in Russian Arctic oil and gas development. The United States also broke off the mil-mil contacts. Still, cooperation proceeded on issues related to Arctic sustainable development, health and wellbeing, and biodiversity. A new interstate agreement was signed on scientific cooperation (2015), a polar code for Arctic shipping was reached through the International Maritime Organization (2017) and a Central Arctic Oceans Fisheries Agreement was signed in 2018 to preclude commercial fishing in this region until science provided guidance.
Despite these successes, the most serious signal of declining Arctic Council cooperation and consensus was the failure (largely attributed to U.S. objections about the inclusion of language on climate change) of the Arctic Council Ministerial meeting to reach an agreement last year in Rovaniemi, Finland on a Ministerial Declaration, a first since the Council inception in 1996.
The Arctic is the highest priority strategic national interest of Russia. Arctic oil and gas resources are essential to Russia’s economic future as is the defense of its territory along its four-thousand-kilometer Arctic coastline. Key military assets protect its second-strike nuclear capability based on the Kola Peninsula. Russia has refurbished Soviet-era air and naval installations and built new ones, augmented troop presence and conducted extensive maneuvers, installed modern radar and electronic warfare capabilities and developed a new overarching Arctic military command. Moscow argues these are defensive measures to deter possible Western threats to Russian sovereignty and protect the Northern Sea Route and its Arctic resources. This stance is part of President Putin’s broader narrative about hostile U.S. and NATO intentions towards Russia and allegations about U.S. hegemonic aspirations.
The United States sees the Arctic as a low-risk conflict zone but with concerns, the Russian military augmentation goes beyond defense and aims to neutralize NATO naval forces operating in the North Atlantic approaches to Russia. The United States has responded with its own military maneuvers, plans to add six icebreakers to its very limited fleet and at last year’s Arctic Council Ministerial, Secretary of State Pompeo introduced hard security issues as he sharply criticized the Russian military buildup and charged Russia and China with aggressive intentions in the Arctic.
In short, the situation today in the Arctic shows both traditional cooperation and increasing competition leading to more uncertainty.
The U.S.-Russia relationship is bad and both Russian and U.S. officials do not see the situation changing soon. The number of issues is daunting: Iran, North Korea, Ukraine, Russian interference in U.S. elections, and the future of arms control, specifically whether the two sides can agree to renew the New Start nuclear arms control agreement. Presidents Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin do speak regularly but the level of diplomatic contacts is a shadow of what previously existed. And with both countries reeling from the coronavirus onslaught, the impetus to turn inward grows.
We are cognizant of these deep divides but believe it is in our interest to be open to areas of cooperation where we can benefit. Arms control heads the list but the Arctic should be included for several reasons, including timing.
Russia assumes the rotating chairmanship of the Arctic Council for two years in 2021 and will want to demonstrate a successful stewardship. Moscow’s agenda will focus on economic development as well as scientific and environmental cooperation but it could be open to initiatives to show peaceful intentions. The current world economic recession and a sharp drop in energy prices have taken the steam out of expectations for near term development of Arctic energy resources. And the November U.S. presidential election may lead the next president, no matter who wins, to look for ways where progress with Russia may be possible. Enhanced dialog on Arctic issues should be high on the list.
First, the United States should resume high-level military to military contacts on the Arctic. This would not reward Russian aggression in Ukraine or its reported reprehensible steps in Afghanistan. Rather, a hard security dialog over the Arctic could give us a better understanding of the aims of the Russian military buildup and reduce the risk of incidents leading to unintended consequences. Second, the United States should explore discussions on whether the Northern Sea Route is an internal passageway as Russia contends or an international waterway governed by the UN Convention of the Law of the Sea as the United States contends. Russia has taken steps to enforce its interpretation which the United States views as a violation of the right to freedom of navigation guaranteed under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. And third, we could explore a code of conduct for the Arctic Ocean building on the 1972 U.S.-USSR Incidents at Sea Agreement which remains in effect.
The United States and Russia have disagreements on many specific issues and more broadly on the organization of the international system. No “reset” in relations is in sight but there is a need to put a floor in the relationship and work on possible areas for cooperation. The Arctic can be one but only if the United States moves to prevent further deterioration and provide “cooling” to a region important to all nations.

Climate change has already removed at least 75 percent of Arctic summer sea ice volume at rates never before experienced in human history. Soon, the Arctic Ocean will be like other oceans for much of the year: open water that is exposed to exploitation and environmental destruction.
Despite the Arctic Ocean’s unique vulnerabilities, it is still the least protected of all the world’s oceans. Less than 1.5 percent has any form of protected area status. The high seas of the Arctic — which belong to no single nation — are under no form of protection.
A strong Global Ocean Treaty will enable us to finally protect the Arctic Ocean, as part of a network of sanctuaries.
And we aren’t the only ones who want this: a Greenpeace survey revealed that 74 percent of people across 30 different countries support the establishment of a global sanctuary in the international waters around the North Pole. More than 70 percent of those people believed that the Arctic should be free of oil drilling and other heavy industry.
How do we envision an Arctic Sanctuary?
The Arctic ocean is vast, and its ecosystem depends on that immense size. An Arctic Sanctuary would need to be large as well. The Arctic high seas make up an area the size of the Mediterranean Sea.
Within the Arctic Sanctuary, there would be no fishing, no military activity and no exploration for or extraction of fossil fuels or other minerals from the seabed.
Strict environmental controls would apply to all shipping in this area, although not all shipping activity would be prohibited. Heavy fuel oil use, for example, would not be allowed — a practice that is already adopted in Antarctic waters.
We will be pressuring the international community every chance we get. And our effort in collaboration with many organizations and indigenous peoples’ to collect signatories for an Arctic Declaration in solidarity with Arctic peoples was a big step in this direction.
When we set out to protect the Arctic from destructive oil drilling and commercial fishing people told us it was impossible. Now after years of pushing millions of us have secured an enormous area protected from commercial fishing in the center of the Arctic Ocean, and we’re getting closer every day to an Arctic safe from oil drilling too.",,John Hocevar | May,,,2019-10-09,Greenpeace USA

What You Need to Know
What to Expect
The Arctic encompasses several countries and cultures. You can learn about Inuit customs in Nunavut, Canada’s newest territory, or also explore the Indigenous cultures of Greenland. Then there’s the outpost of Longyearbyen in Spitsbergen, the capital of the Svalbard archipelago. Visitors can have an entirely different experience in the remote lands within the Russian Arctic. Such diversity is part of the appeal of an Arctic expedition.
How to Get There
Speak to your Polar Travel Advisor who can explain where your voyage will embark and provide information on the nearest airport. Transfer flights are sometimes included in your package and are arranged by Quark Expeditions. Some embarkations require passengers to book flights at preferred times. Speak to your polar travel advisor.
Visas & Passports
Always travel with a passport that’s valid for at least six months. Some Arctic expeditions may require a visa in addition to your passport, depending on your nationality and the country you’re visiting. Remember that some of our expeditions visit multiple countries. Speak to one of our experienced Polar Travel Advisors, who can outline the travel documents required for your chosen expedition, or contact your local consulate or embassy.
Arctic Destinations
The Canadian High Arctic includes lands in the Northwest Territories, Yukon and Nunavut. There are more than 35,563 islands in the remote Canadian Arctic Archipelago, which includes Baffin Island and Ellesmere Island. The mountains, glaciers, tundra, remote rocky shorelines, granite cliffs and Arctic waters are home to polar bears, grizzly bears, muskoxen, beluga whales, harp seals, walruses and migratory birds, among other wildlife species.
The best of Greenland can be found along its coastline, which is dominated by icebergs, glaciers, deep fjords, mountains and vast stretches of wilderness. Greenland’s traditional Inuit communities (descendants of the Thule people) appeal to travelers with a passion for ancient cultures. For nature-lovers, Greenland offers unrivalled wildlife-viewing: polar bears, muskoxen, humpback whales, walruses, sea eagles and reindeer. And of course, there’s the Aurora Borealis, commonly known as the Northern Lights.
The chance to stand at the very top of the world lures travelers to the North Pole, which is often called “terra incognita,” the unknown land. No one lives on this constantly shifting ice domain in the middle of the Arctic Ocean at 90° North. The closest permanently inhabited settlement is Alert, Nunavut, about 800 kilometres (508 miles) away. There’s an otherworldly quality to the North Pole—where every direction you look is south.
Russia’s Arctic territory, most of which has no permanent human population, includes 24,140 kilometres of coastline along the Arctic Ocean, the Barents Sea, Bering Sea and the Sea of Okhotsk. Various Arctic archipelagoes, such as Novaya Zemlya and Severnaya Zemlya, make up much of the Russian Arctic. Russia’s remote, seldom-visited Franz Josef Land, 950 kilometres from the North Pole, attracts polar adventurers, as well.
Spitsbergen is the largest island in the Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard, and is often called “The land of the midnight sun.” The island is also known as “The Wildlife Capital of the Arctic.” Polar bears, walruses, reindeers, arctic foxes, beluga whales, seals and seabirds are found amongst the icebergs, glaciers and snow-covered mountains.

Arctic countries need to lead the cut of CO2
The hottest temperature ever measured above the Arctic circle was recorded in Verkhoyansk, Siberia this past June. In fact, the + 38.6°C reading was just one of many highs that made June 2020 in Siberia five degrees warmer than any June from 1981 to 2010. A recent Oxford University-led study shows man-made climate change due to carbon emissions made this Siberian heatwave 600 times more likely. Read more
Why it matters
The Arctic's shallow and biologically productive seas are also rich with oil reserves. But oil exploration poses a tremendous risk to vulnerable Arctic ecosystems and communities. Oil and gas development could also damage fisheries, tourism and other, more sustainable economic activities. The production of Arctic oil and gas contributes even more to the climate crisis through increased greenhouse gas emissions.

How we work
A quieter ocean for Arctic whales
Whales depend on sound to survive. WWF is working to limit sound pollution in Arctic waters by making parts of the ocean important for whales off limits to particularly loud industrial activities.
Addressing offshore drilling
For more than a decade, WWF has worked to stop offshore oil and gas development that threatens the wildlife and local communities that thrive in the Arctic’s often brutal environment.
Keeping oil out of important areas
WWF is working in Norway to make areas such as Lofoten permanently off limits to oil drilling, because of the natural values of the region, and the economic value of the local fishery.
Promoting marine governance in Russia
WWF promotes marine governance in the Arctic that includes cooperation and biodiversity protection within the Arctic Council. WWF-Russia previously participated in negotiations on legally binding agreement on Oil Spill Response, and following its approval, promotes its implementation in Russia.
Promoting renewable energy
WWF is advocating for renewable energy, and piloting renewable solutions with some Arctic communities.
Reducing the impact of oil and gas in Russia
WWF works to prevent and reduce the negative impact of oil, gas and mining on the Arctic environment by pushing companies to strengthen environmental responsibility and by improving the regulatory framework.
Reducing the oil spill risk
WWF has mapped the enormous potential reach of an oil spill in the Barents Sea.

The people and animals that live in the Arctic depend on its unique ecosystem to survive. Yet major companies like Shell and Exxon are making aggressive moves to usher in a new “oil rush” in the Arctic Ocean. In some places it has already begun. Russian oil giant Gazprom has already begun producing small amounts oil from the Arctic in the ocean north of Russia.
Here’s why we can’t let ANY drilling in the Arctic continue.
When We Drill, We Spill
The long history of oil spills around the world has made one thing clear: the only way to prevent an oil spill is to keep oil in the ground.
Fragile Arctic ice and tricky weather conditions make a spill in the region even more likely. In a review of Shell’s plans to drill in the Alaskan Arctic Ocean, the U.S. Department of the Interior found that there’s a 75 percent chance of a major oil spill if an oil company finds oil and produces it. Even though the Department of Interior is taking the Arctic off the table for oil drilling for the next two years, it’s critically important that the region is closed to ALL new oil drilling forever.
How Do You Clean up an Arctic Oil Spill?
No oil company has ever successfully cleaned up a major spill.
In 1989, the Exxon Valdez spilled 11 million gallons of oil into Alaska’s Prince William Sound. Exxon spent $2 billion trying to clean up and recovered less than 7 percent of the oil spilled.
In 2010, the BP Deepwater Horizon blowout spilled up to 200 million barrels into the Gulf of Mexico. Of that, only about 8 percent was recovered or burned off.
Extreme conditions—including icy waves that reach 50 feet—make response in the event of an Arctic spill even more difficult. The nearest response stations to Arctic drilling sites are located thousands of miles away.
Keep It in the Ground
For the sake of the people and animals that call the Arctic home—not to mention the global climate—we must keep offshore oil in the ground for good. There’s no climate-safe future that involves drilling in the Arctic Ocean.
It’s the only way to prevent a devastating spill and end our dependence on fossil fuels.

Foreword from the minister
The Arctic and Northern Policy Framework is a profound change of direction for the Government of Canada. For too long, Canada's Arctic and northern residents, especially Indigenous people, have not had access to the same services, opportunities, and standards of living as those enjoyed by other Canadians. There are longstanding inequalities in transportation, energy, communications, employment, community infrastructure, health and education. While almost all past governments have put forward northern strategies, none closed these gaps for the people of the North, or created a lasting legacy of sustainable economic development.
In her 2016 Interim Report on the Shared Arctic Leadership Model, Minister's Special Representative Mary Simon said, ""the simple fact is that Arctic strategies throughout my lifetime have rarely matched or addressed the magnitude of the basic gaps between what exists in the Arctic and what other Canadians take for granted.""
Co-developing the new framework became a bold opportunity to shape and direct change in the region by collaborating with governments, northerners and Indigenous governments and organizations. Consultation was not enough to meet the challenges and harness emerging opportunities in the Arctic and North. In a significant shift, the federal government, Indigenous peoples, Inuit, First Nations and Métis, 6 territorial and provincial governments (Yukon, Northwest Territories, Nunavut, Newfoundland and Labrador, Quebec, and Manitoba) contributed to this framework together.
A shared vision
Today, there is a shared vision of the future where northern and Arctic people are thriving, strong and safe. The Arctic and Northern Policy Framework gives us a roadmap to achieve this vision. There are clear priorities and actions set out by the federal government and its partners to:
- nurture healthy families and communities
- invest in the energy, transportation and communications infrastructure that northern and Arctic governments, economies and communities need
- create jobs, foster innovation and grow Arctic and northern economies
- support science, knowledge and research that is meaningful for communities and for decision-making
- face the effects of climate change and support healthy ecosystems in the Arctic and North
- ensure that Canada and our northern and Arctic residents are safe, secure and well-defended
- restore Canada's place as an international Arctic leader
- advance reconciliation and improve relationships between Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples
For the federal government, the framework's goals will guide investments and activities, through 2030. Implementing the Arctic and Northern Policy Framework will require collaborative approaches. Our government recognizes that 'made in Ottawa' policies have not been successful. The new approach puts the future into the hands of the people who live there to realize the promise of the Arctic and the North. Through the co-development of the framework, and by working in partnership to realize its vision and implement its goals and objectives, this initiative will advance reconciliation and renew Canada's relationship with Inuit, First Nations, Métis and support the non-Indigenous residents of Canada's Arctic and North.
A crucial element of this innovative, cooperative form of policy making is the inclusion of chapters from our Indigenous, territorial and provincial partners. Through these chapters, our partners speak directly to Canadians and to the world, expressing their own visions, aspirations and priorities. These critical components of the Arctic and Northern Policy Framework map out areas of present and future collaboration between partners and the Government of Canada, and will provide guidance on the implementation of the framework.
In reflecting their priorities and aspirations, these chapters recognize and advance the vision and interests of Inuit, First Nations and Métis peoples. Partners have chosen their own approaches to crafting these chapters. For example, Yukon First Nations and the Government of Yukon have collaborated closely during the development of the Arctic and Northern Policy Framework, and will be producing separate chapters that speak to their mutual as well as distinct interests. First Nations and Métis worked with the Government of the Northwest Territories to draft the Northwest Territories chapter of the framework.
Inuit Nunangat is the Inuit homeland in Canada. Inuit are the majority population in this distinct geographic, cultural, and political region. In order to respect and support Inuit self-determination, an Inuit Nunangat chapter was developed as an Inuit-Crown Partnership Committee deliverable. This chapter will guide how Arctic and Northern Policy Framework goals and objectives are implemented in Inuit Nunangat. This will ensure that the framework respects Inuit rights and that an Inuit Nunangat approach is utilized in the development and implementation of federal policies and programs that are intended to benefit Inuit, creating efficiencies that in turn benefit all Canadians.
Territorial governments have authored chapters setting out their priorities for new investments and approaches in areas such as economic development, infrastructure and post-secondary education. Yukon, Northwest Territories and Nunavut are also contributing a pan-territorial chapter that articulates their common challenges and opportunities. Drawing on the 2017 Pan-Territorial Vision for Sustainable Development, the territorial governments offer their vision for how the Arctic and Northern Policy Framework can support strong and healthy communities, based on a foundation of responsible resource development, economic diversification, infrastructure and innovation.
The next phase of framework co-development will focus on implementation, investment strategies and governance, moving towards more integrated federal-territorial-provincial and Indigenous approaches to challenges and opportunities in Canada's Arctic and North. Partner chapters will be integral to this next step towards improving the quality of life for our Arctic and Northern residents, especially for Indigenous peoples.
On the front lines of climate change…
The Canadian North is warming at about 3 times the global average rate, which is affecting the land, biodiversity, cultures and traditions.Footnote 1 At the same time, climate change and technology are making the Arctic more accessible.
The region has become an important crossroad where issues of climate change, international trade and global security meet. As melting sea ice opens shipping routes, it is also putting the rich wealth of northern natural resources within reach. Increased commercial and tourism interests also bring increased safety and security challenges that include search and rescue and human-created disasters.
By forging new partnerships, the framework will help address the massive implications of climate change for individuals, communities, businesses and governments alike, and ensure a more sustainable future for northerners.
…and a changing world
Unlike previous Arctic and northern policies, the framework better aligns Canada's current national and international policy objectives with the priorities of Indigenous peoples and of northerners. As the region undergoes rapid environmental change and international interest surges, Canada must demonstrate renewed Arctic leadership.
The Government of Canada will continue to support the co-operative, rules-based international order that has served national and global interests by fostering peace, security and stability for the circumpolar Arctic. Canada will also continue to ensure that the Canadian Arctic and North and its people are safe, secure and well defended. As part of achieving this goal, Canada has committed to increasing Search and Rescue reaction and responsiveness to emergencies for Arctic residents and visitors.
What have we done so far?
The framework and its chapters provide a foundation for future cooperation between the Government of Canada and its Arctic and Northern partners.
The time has arrived to put the goals and objectives into action. The Government of Canada has already begun to realize the framework's vision of thriving, strong and safe communities, and made progress on the priorities identified in the chapters developed by Indigenous, territorial and provincial partners. The following provides just some examples of Canada's commitment to responding to the priorities of partners and the needs and aspirations of our Arctic and Northern residents.
Investments to support better, more relevant and accessible education have been identified in the Inuit Nunangat and Northwest Territories chapters and by Yukon Government. The 2019 federal budget included:
- funding for a task force to study post-secondary education, which will make recommendations on a robust system of higher education in the Arctic and North
- support for culturally-appropriate and community-developed courses for Indigenous and non-Indigenous northern students through the Dechinta Centre for Research and Learning
- an Inuit-led post-secondary education strategy
As well, a new science building at Yukon College will be built to support the goal of transforming this institution into Canada's first university in the North.
To build stronger communities, there is funding for community-led food production projects and skills training for local and Indigenous food production systems. Recent federal investments and policy development undertaken in cooperation with Indigenous peoples will help strengthen food security in Arctic and northern communities and reinforce Indigenous connections with wildlife and the land, as called for in the Inuit Nunangat chapter. The Government of Canada has recently invested $62.6 million over 5 years starting in fiscal year 2019 to 2020, with $10.4 million ongoing to support changes to the Nutrition North program, including a Harvesters Support Grant to help lower the high costs associated with traditional hunting and harvesting activities, which are an important source of healthy, traditional food. Canada and Inuit have also established an Inuit-Crown Food Security working group to focus on food security and work towards a sustainable food system in Inuit Nunangat.
As stated in the Northwest Territories chapter, growing a diversified and sustainable economy is vital to cushioning the northern economy from boom and bust cycles. The federal Jobs and Tourism Initiative will support cultural exchange and expand trade opportunities, while the new Inclusive Diversification and Economic Advancement in the North initiative will provide funds for a wider range of infrastructure such as roads and visitors centres.
Funding has been allocated for scientific research in the North, including for advancing Canada's claim to its continental shelf in both the Arctic and Atlantic oceans, for the Polar Continental Shelf Program, and for the Eureka Weather Station on Ellesmere Island. In its chapter, the Northwest Territories identifies the achieving of major advances in the remediation of reclamation sites following resource development as an environmental priority; cleaning up old mine sites of debris and toxic materials will be funded under the Northern Abandoned Mine Reclamation Program.
New transportation infrastructure funding has been identified by all partner chapters as crucial to improving safety and fostering economic and social development. Canada is investing $71.7 million in federal funding through Canada's National Trade Corridors Fund for four Nunavut transportation projects, including preparatory work on the Grays Bay Road and Port Project and an expansion of the Rankin Inlet airport terminal building capacity. Funding for priority action items identified in the Northwest Territories chapter was included in the 2019 federal budget investments in support of the eventual framework. For example, planning for the proposed Taltson hydroelectricity expansion project in the Northwest Territories, identified as a priority infrastructure project, is funded starting in 2019. There is also a commitment for long-awaited, universal high-speed internet in remote and northern communities. Delivering high-speed internet to these communities will help businesses grow, create new jobs and connect people to the resources, services and information they need to build a better future. It is a key step to closing the gap in the quality of life experienced by Arctic and northern residents and other Canadians. As part of its commitment to support new protection for the High Arctic and create opportunities for Inuit, the Government of Canada is providing infrastructure investments totaling over $190 million to build multi-use buildings, food processing units and harbours.
Canada's international interests are supported through funding for the first Arctic Council-related permanent secretariat in Canada (for the Sustainable Development Working Group), increasing the participation of northerners in Arctic Council and Arctic research activities and providing northern youth with international learning opportunities.
The Inuit Nunangat chapter singles out mental health and closing gaps in social and economic well-being between Inuit and other Canadians as central to developing strong communities and advancing reconciliation. In partnership with Inuit organizations, Canada continues to invest towards this goal, including: new addictions treatment facilities in Nunavut and Nunavik with an emphasis on suicide prevention as well as significant new funding dedicated to health and social services for Inuit children.
Our future
The Arctic and Northern Policy Framework is ambitious and has just over 10 years to translate its goals and objectives into reality. In that time, the Government of Canada and its partners will close the gaps that exist between this region, particularly in relation to its Indigenous peoples, and the rest of the country.
Canada sees a future in which the people of the Arctic and North are full participants in Canadian society, with access to the same services, opportunities and standards of living as those enjoyed by other Canadians. This ambition will require greater effort, focus, trust and collaboration amongst partners.
Other circumpolar nations are making significant investments to make their Arctic regions part of the global community. Supporting Canadian initiatives to keep pace with international efforts will bring increased opportunities, health and well-being to Indigenous peoples and northerners.
Indigenous and Northern leaders have offered their best innovative, adaptive policy solutions that call for trust, inclusiveness and transparency. We can do no less than to respond with integrity, collaboration and openness. Building on these new partnerships, the Arctic and Northern Policy Framework provides a long-term foundation for transformative change, benefiting our Arctic, its Indigenous peoples, northern residents and all Canadians.
The Honourable Carolyn Bennett,
Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs
""The simple fact is that Arctic strategies throughout my lifetime have rarely matched or addressed the magnitude of the basic gaps between what exists in the Arctic and what other Canadians take for granted.""
— Mary Simon, Interim report on the Shared Arctic Leadership Model
Our vision
Strong, self-reliant people and communities working together for a vibrant, prosperous and sustainable Arctic and northern region at home and abroad, while expressing Canada's enduring Arctic sovereignty.
On December 20, 2016, the Government of Canada announced that a new Arctic Policy Framework would be co-developed in collaboration with Indigenous, territorial and provincial partners.Footnote 2
Canada recognizes that what has been done before has not succeeded in building a strong, sustainable region where most people share in the opportunities expected by most Canadians. Insufficient physical and social infrastructure has hindered opportunities for growth and prosperity in the region.
Doing what we have done before as a nation has not closed the gaps in well-being between Arctic and northern people and the rest of the country, so in trying to close those gaps, we have taken an approach that has not been tried before. Inspired by the consensus traditions of Arctic and northern Indigenous peoples, the federal government sought to engage representatives of territories, provinces, and Indigenous peoples as partners in the development of this policy framework. All have made considerable contributions. There is not unanimous agreement on all the issues, but robust and respectful discussion has shaped this document.
This federal framework is informed by extensive engagement, including:
- regional roundtables held in Arctic and northern communities
- interest-based roundtables
- a public submissions process
The voices of people who took part in these engagements are included here, as well as in the other integral parts of the framework which describe:
- Canada's international Arctic policy
- Canada's commitment to safety, security and defence in the region
- the distinctive needs and opportunities of:territoriesprovincesArctic and Northern Indigenous peoples of Canada
These sections provide further detail on priorities, aspirations, and potential actions to be implemented under the framework.
The Government of Canada committed to co-develop an ""Arctic Policy Framework"" with:
- Inuit
- First Nations
- Métis
- territorial governments
- the governments of Manitoba, Quebec and Newfoundland and Labrador
The area covered by the word ""Arctic"" has many definitions. As we worked together on the policy framework, several partners, including First Nations in Yukon as well as First Nations and Métis in the Northwest Territories, expressed concerns that they did not feel included in the term ""Arctic."" Inuit also drew attention to the way in which terms can include and exclude. Often, strategies, policies, programming and investments targeted for the ""North"" have been directed towards the three territories and excluded Inuit. In response to these concerns, Canada's vision for the framework takes into account both the ""Arctic"" and ""Northern"" character of the region and those who live there; it is a policy framework for Canada's Arctic and North that includes the entirety of Inuit Nunangat — the Inuvialuit Settlement Region in the Northwest Territories, Labrador's Nunatsiavut region, the territory of Nunavik in Quebec, and Nunavut — the Inuit homeland in Canada.Footnote 3
In developing this framework, we have built on the extensive work already done by Indigenous, territorial and provincial partners. This includes the Pan-Territorial Vision for Sustainable Development, which is foundational to the framework.
The Pan-Territorial Vision, released by the territorial governments in 2017, reinforces the importance of resource development, economic diversification, improved infrastructure and innovation in building strong territorial economies and increasing self-reliance.
Other key policy initiatives that have contributed to the development of the framework include:
- strategies developed by Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami such as:National Inuit Suicide Prevention StrategyNational Inuit Strategy for Research
- the Parnasimautik Consultation Report produced by Nunavik Inuit
- the Government of Quebec's Plan Nord
- the work of the Look North steering committee appointed by the Government of Manitoba
""Every Northerner deserves the opportunity to experience wellness and the strength of community that characterizes Canadians. Economic development and diversification are foundational to this goal.""
— Pan-Territorial Vision for Sustainable Development
Our partners have helped us to understand and reflect the unique opportunities and challenges within the different regions, jurisdictional responsibilities and treaty rights across the Arctic and the North. The ongoing collaboration required to make this work is essential to the framework's successful implementation.
Together with the people and governments of the Arctic and the North, we will use domestic and international policies and investments to help realize the potential of the region and those who live there.
Another important contribution to this framework was made by Mary Simon, the Special Representative of the Minister of Indigenous and Northern Affairs, who advised the federal government on the most pressing issues facing the region. As Ms. Simon noted in her final report on shared Arctic leadership, there is a ""long history of visions, action plans, strategies and initiatives being devised 'for the North' and not 'with the North'."" This is why this framework has been co-developed for the North, in partnership with the North, to reflect the needs and priorities of the North.
""Nothing about us, without us"" is the essential principle that weaves federal, territorial, provincial and Indigenous institutions and interests together for mutual success. The Arctic and Northern Policy Framework is a response to change in the region. The framework represents an opportunity for Arctic and northern people, and their institutions, municipalities, organizations and governments, to come together with the federal government to shape and direct change toward better outcomes. Together, we can achieve our vision of strong, self-reliant people and communities working together for a vibrant, prosperous and sustainable Arctic and northern region at home and abroad, while expressing Canada's enduring Arctic sovereignty.
Our past
The Government of Canada is committed to building trust with our Arctic and northern partners.
To do so, we must first:
- begin to acknowledge the damaging aspects of our shared past
- face the challenges and opportunities of our shared present
- advance a vision of a shared, collaborative and brighter future
Prior to contact with non-Indigenous peoples, the first peoples had already developed sophisticated technologies, flourishing trading networks, and a rich and diverse array of innovative practices that allowed them to live well in difficult conditions.
The Inuit lived mostly on the coast, and developed innovative watercraft and hunting gear that enabled them to hunt game as large as bowhead whales. First Nations peoples tended to live inland, using both land and freshwater bodies; they developed watercraft suited to lakes and rivers and snowshoes that allowed them to use the land during long northern winters; and they followed the huge caribou herds that migrated between treeline and tundra.
Non-Indigenous people first came north in search of trade and trade routes, and in search of resources such as furs and gold. Most of the early contacts were brief, but over time the initial phase of first encounters and co-operation was followed by more prolonged and extensive contact, increasing numbers of newcomers, and eventually a period of profoundly damaging domination and colonization.
The impacts of colonialism in the Arctic and the North affected Indigenous peoples in many ways, including diseases, cultural assimilation including through residential schools, coerced relocation, and the drawing of international boundaries severing familial and cultural ties.
""There must be a system set up where the Indian people have some control over the programs that affect us. This control must not be just in the Administration of the program — but in the planning. If the idea behind the program is wrong, then we are wasting money, and people, trying to make it work.""
— Council for Yukon Indians, Together Today for Our Children Tomorrow, 1973
Modern self-determination in the region has evolved over the last 50 years and formalized with:
- the James Bay and Northern Quebec Agreement, concluded in 1975
- the Inuvialuit Final Agreement, signed in 1984
- the Umbrella Final Agreement for Yukon, finalized in 199011 of the 14 Yukon First Nations have now concluded agreements
- the Gwich'in comprehensive land claim, signed in 1992
- the Nunavut Agreement signed in 1993
- the Sahtu Dene signed in 1993
- the Métis Comprehensive Land Claim Agreement, signed in 1993
- the Tlicho Land Claims and Self-government agreement, signed in 2003
- the Labrador Inuit Land Claims agreement, signed in 2005
- the Nunavik Inuit Land Claim Agreement, signed in 2006
Many of these land claim agreements established innovative forms of co-management by Indigenous peoples and territorial, provincial and federal governments over land, water and other resources.
In addition to the land claim process and renewal of Indigenous self-government, the 20th and early 21st centuries have witnessed a strengthening of public governments in the Arctic and the North.
Territorial governments have become more democratic and attained increased responsibilities. Province-like powers over land and resources were devolved from the federal government to Yukon in 2003 and to the Northwest Territories in 2014. Negotiations with Nunavut over these powers and responsibilities are ongoing.
Each territory and province has developed unique ways to provide services to Indigenous residents and work with Indigenous governments.
- The Government of Yukon works in partnership with the territory's First Nations, including its 11 self-governing First Nations
- The Government of the Northwest Territories collaborates with Indigenous governments through its Intergovernmental Council and through a formalized commitment to Indigenous governments set out in Respect, Recognition, Responsibility: Government of the Northwest Territories' Approach to Engaging with Aboriginal Governments (2012).
- The Government of Nunavut works with regional Inuit associations through working partnerships to advance shared objectives, including provisions of the Nunavut Agreement.
- Drawing upon Indigenous traditions, the Northwest Territories and Nunavut government legislatures are based on a consensus decision-making system.
- The Government of Quebec works with:the Kativik Regional Government, established through the James Bay and Northern Quebec Agreement and elected by all the inhabitants of the Nunavik regionthe Makivik Corporation, also established by the James Bay and Northern Quebec Agreement, which represents the Inuit of Nunavik in their relations with the governments of Quebec and Canada on issues specifically pertaining to their Indigenous rights
At the forefront of this movement towards greater autonomy are the Indigenous peoples of the Circumpolar North. Their efforts to secure self-determination and self-government are influencing Arctic governance in ways that will have a profound impact on the region and its inhabitants in the years to come.
— Arctic Human Development Report (2015)
As an Arctic nation, Canada has long been interested in finding ways to cooperate with other Arctic and non-Arctic states on shared goals and challenges. In 1996 Canada played a key role in the Ottawa Declaration that created the Arctic Council, the pre-eminent forum for international cooperation in the Arctic on sustainable development and environmental protection. Canadian leadership also contributed to the Arctic Council taking the trail-blazing step of including Indigenous peoples' organizations at the Council table; 3 of which include Canadian membership.Footnote 4
Arctic Indigenous peoples have made remarkable contributions to international governance, both inside and outside the Arctic Council. For instance, the Inuit Circumpolar Council's highlighting impacts of global contaminants on Inuit helped mobilize support for the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants.
The legacy of colonization has left deep rifts in the region's social structure. Those rifts are being gradually healed, in part by the reclamation of self-determination. As highlighted in the Arctic Council's Arctic Human Development Reports, ""fate control"", or ""guiding one's own destiny"", is an important element in peoples' well-being. From the agreements already signed with Indigenous peoples, to those still being negotiated, and the devolution of powers to regional governments, the degree of fate control in the Arctic and the North is on the rise. Part of the challenge we currently face is to ensure that fate control comes with the capacity to meaningfully exercise local aspirations.
Our present
""Why, in spite of substantive progress over the past 40 years, including remarkable achievements such as land claims agreements, Constitutional inclusion and precedent-setting court rulings, does the (Canadian) Arctic continue to exhibit the worst national social indicators for basic wellness? Why, with all the hard-earned tools of empowerment, do many individuals and families not feel empowered and healthy?""
— Mary Simon, A New Shared Arctic Leadership Model
Longstanding inequalities in transportation, energy, communications, employment, community infrastructure, health and education continue to disadvantage people, especially Indigenous peoples, in Canada's Arctic and North. These gaps are evident in the socio-economic statistics and indicators for the region, and closing them is a priority for all partners.
A distinctive feature of the region is its high proportion of Indigenous people in the population. This includes Inuit, First Nations and Métis populations. The manner in which the Government of Canada interacts with Indigenous peoples continues to evolve.
The Principles Respecting the Government of Canada's Relationship with Indigenous Peoples affirm that ""The Government of Canada's approach to reconciliation is guided by the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's Calls to Action, constitutional values, and collaboration with Indigenous peoples as well as provincial and territorial governments."" Inuit and the federal government have developed the Inuit Nunangat Declaration and formed an Inuit-Crown Partnership Committee to jointly advance shared priorities. These include the implementation of Inuit land claims agreements, and the implementation of reconciliation measures between Inuit and the Government of Canada.
The federal government agrees with the people of the Arctic and the North that they must play a greater part in governing the region — domestically and internationally. In addition to land claim and self-government agreements, devolution agreements have been signed with the Northwest Territories and Yukon, transferring some authorities to their respective territorial governments, and another such agreement is being negotiated with Nunavut. Relationships that better recognize the rights and aspirations of people in the region have also been negotiated with sectors other than government. Benefit and partnership agreements with local communities have been developed in the resource sector, and successful partnerships have been established with researchers, and with non-governmental organizations.
The Arctic and North has what is described as a mixed economy: some people depend on traditional economies of hunting, fishing, and gathering, others depend on a wage economy, and some depend on both. The cultures and lifestyles of the peoples of the region provide them not only with subsistence and cultural continuity and strength, but also a bridge to the wage economy.
Despite the poor communications infrastructure in many communities, connectivity is increasingly important to the region.
- Students in Nunavut can connect to students throughout Inuit Nunungat
- A telehealth network links 14 Yukon communities
- Yellowknife's booming tourism industry is transformed by visitors' social media posts
- Telehealth is providing an opportunity to close gaps within the care provided to patients in Labrador
- Remote presence technology is allowing people on the northern coast of Labrador to receive some health-care services in their home communities
However, though there have been significant advances, many northern communities still have slow internet connections and no cell phone service, and priority within networks must be kept for vital services such as telehealth.
""…latent mineral potential of the north is perhaps still the single most likely source of long-term northern prosperity.""
— Look North Report and Action Plan for Manitoba's Northern Economy
Responsible, sustainable resource development and job creation are key to the economy of the region, and a source of prosperity for its communities and residents. Indigenous-owned businesses have for many years been providing resource industries with workers and services, and now Indigenous peoples are also moving into ownership positions in resource development businesses. Indigenous ownership, investment and participation in the resource industry are essential to the success of this sector and a means of economic reconciliation with Indigenous peoples.
Resource projects provide:
- education
- training and employment opportunities in communities
- direct Indigenous participation in supply and services business development
Looking to the future, there is no force likely to reshape the Arctic and the North greater than climate change. Globally, the region is amongst the most affected by climate change, which is redefining the environmental, social and economic landscape, both below the tree line and on the tundra. Arctic ecosystems are at a disproportionately high risk of experiencing the adverse effects of global warming.
The circumpolar Arctic is warming 2 to 3 times more rapidly than the global average, even though the region is not a leading source of greenhouse gas emissions.Footnote 5 According to Canada's Changing Climate Report, 2019, northern warming will continue for both low and high global greenhouse gas emission trajectories. The high scenario projects that annual average temperatures could increase 4 times as much as under the low scenario, and that events such as extreme precipitation could be 4 times as common.
Both scenarios would see accelerating loss of seasonal sea ice across Canada's Arctic, with extensive sea ice-free periods projected by mid-century for the Canadian Arctic and Hudson Bay, thawing permafrost causing irreversible changes to the landscape, a changed distribution of species, changing patterns of precipitation and more frequent wildfires.
Indigenous communities are particularly affected: traditional food sources are disappearing; ice conditions are becoming unpredictable and therefore dangerous for travel by hunters using either dogsled or snowmobile; and melting ice and rising sea levels are exposing communities to destructive coastal erosion and costly damage to infrastructure.
The greenhouse gases driving climate change are also making the water more acidic, which has been shown to have negative effects on some marine life. Considering the depth and irreversible nature of changes brought about by climate change in the region, Indigenous peoples are finding their cultural and social well-being affected at unprecedented rates.
For peoples closely connected to the land, ways of knowing are challenged to keep pace with the change around them. This is affecting cultural and social norms, such as engaging youth on the land, accessing country foods, gathering medicinal plants and protecting water sources. Indigenous communities need tools and knowledge that are locally and culturally appropriate to adapt to these urgent issues.
If there is a single argument for a collaborative approach to a shared Arctic and northern future, it is the shared and complex challenges posed by climate change. The response of all partners to this challenge must be no less transformative in scale, scope or duration.
As the sea-ice pack recedes and cold-weather technologies improve, the Arctic and the North region are also becoming increasingly accessible for a broad range of activities, including:
- fishing
- tourism
- scientific research
- shipping, both small and large vessels
- other commercial activities
Increasing numbers of domestic and international resource developers are being drawn to the region, resulting in a mix of optimism about economic prospects and concerns about potential environmental, social and security impacts. Higher levels of activity also increase the acute security risks associated with irregular movements of people and goods, the pursuit of foreign interests and human-induced disasters. As a whole, these changes highlight the importance of enhancing situational awareness across the region, and of promoting research and observation, including charting and mapping, that will provide the information necessary for sound decision-making.
A collaborative approach to climate change research is underway in the region, bringing together Inuit organizations, northern communities, federal and provincial agencies and the private sector. This effort is directed at understanding how climate change will affect communities and biodiversity. However, the current lack of baseline data poses major challenges to evidence-based decision-making. The responsible use of data can help cultivate a better understanding of the 'big picture' of environmental issues, contributing to the development of informed, data-driven policy and decisions that can help Arctic and northern communities build resiliency in the face of climate change.
Other currents are also driving change in the lives of Arctic and northern people. The place of the Arctic in the global consciousness has changed enormously over the past few years.
- Growing global interest in the region has been shown by several non-Arctic states and actors in Europe and Asia that have developed Arctic policies or strategies.
- Increased interest in the Arctic reflects concern about the global impacts of climate-driven changes in the region, including its increasing strategic and military importance.
There are already national and international efforts to ensure that growing international interest does not lead to additional problems for people in the region. For instance, the International Maritime Organization's Polar Code has mandated that larger ships travelling in polar waters are better equipped than previously, and their crews better prepared.
In particular, the idea of the ""Northwest Passage"" continues to stir the imagination of people around the world. While transiting the various waterways that are commonly referred to as the ""Northwest Passage"" may be increasingly feasible at certain times of the year due to diminishing ice coverage, extremely variable ice conditions continue to make navigation difficult and hazardous. Unregulated vessel traffic and accidents could have a devastating impact on Arctic and northern people and the unique environment in which they live. As these waterways are Canada's internal waters, Canada will continue to manage vessel traffic within our national waters to ensure that navigation is conducted in accordance with our rigorous safety and environmental protection standards.
There are robust rules, norms and institutions in place that guide international affairs.
- The Arctic Council and other multilateral forums such as the Arctic Coast Guard Forum, Arctic Economic Council and various United Nations organizations, including the International Maritime Organization, make decisions affecting the region
- An extensive international legal framework applies to the Arctic Ocean, including the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea
- Canada is also a signatory to several legally-binding international agreements that address Arctic-specific issues
- Canada has bilateral relationships in place with other Arctic states to address issues of a bilateral nature
Territorial and provincial governments and Indigenous partners are regularly engaged in the development of Canada's international Arctic policy through a well-established mechanism, and are often members of the Canadian delegation to international meetings and negotiations. Canada strongly believes that the rules-based international order in the Arctic and the North has been beneficial to national and global interests by helping to foster peace, security and stability for the region.
Through the wide range of activities undertaken by the Government of Canada, its partners and local communities, Canada's enduring sovereignty over its Arctic and northern lands and waters is continually expressed. Canada's sovereignty over the region is long-standing, well-established and based on historic title, and founded in part on the presence of Inuit and First Nations since time immemorial.
The Canadian Armed Forces play a key role in demonstrating Canada's sovereignty across all of its territory. In the Arctic and the North, this is undertaken through:
- an established and permanent presence, with the Joint Task Force — North headquarters in Yellowknife, Northwest Territories
- detachments in Iqaluit, Nunavut and Whitehorse, Yukon
- the 5 Wing Goose Bay base in Labrador which protects North American airspace and also supports military training
- the Canadian Rangers which serve as the military's eyes and ears in remote and northern communities.
The Canadian Armed Forces conduct:
- regular operations and exercises in the Arctic and the North to enhance their ability to operate and demonstrate presence
- air, land and sea patrols
- air and sea search and rescue activities
- monitor and control airspace through the North American Aerospace Defence Command (NORAD) network
- work with government and community partners to ensure safety and security in the region.
What we heard and what we know
Broad engagement with Arctic and northern people and other interested Canadians was an important element in the co-development of this document. The engagement helped shape the content of this framework, as did the work undertaken by territorial, provincial and Indigenous partners in developing their own priorities. This includes foundational documents developed by public governments, such as the Pan-Territorial Vision for Sustainable Development, as well as those of Indigenous governments and organizations.
""To create a better North for our children, the focus needs to be on what forms of knowledge and skills exist within our communities and how the federal government can assist in building upon and supporting these strengths. This means focusing on what we have versus focusing on what we lack, and valuing our existing capacity over voices that tell us we are not capable.""
— ""We Are One Mind"" report, written submission
Arctic and northern leadership
During public engagement on the framework, participants underscored the importance of decision-making about the Arctic and north moving closer to the region. The need for Arctic and northern leadership in crafting solutions, and the necessity of stable and accessible funding for federal programming, were often given as conditions for progress on regional challenges. Building capacity in regional organizations was also identified as a key part of developing leadership.
Participants highlighted the importance of building upon previous strategies, policies and agreements, notably land claim agreements and Canada's commitment to fully implement the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. They want to see full implementation of economic, social and cultural rights, as laid out in the land claims and in the declaration. They also want to see implementation of provisions related to economic development and land use planning.
Strong people and communities
Views expressed through the engagement sessions varied widely, but for many participants the theme of ""strong Arctic and northern people and communities"" was seen as the most central to the development of the new Arctic and Northern Policy Framework for Canada. Institutions and services rooted in local cultures and language were a widespread prescription for addressing social challenges, and for building strong people and communities. There was concern about the erosion of Indigenous languages, and a demand for programs that would assist with the revitalization of language and culture.
- In 2014, about 22% of Northwest Territories households indicated that they often or sometimes worried that food would run out before they had money to buy more
- Just under 70% of Inuit households in Nunavut are food insecure
Life expectancy is considered one of the most fundamental indicators of the overall health and wellness of a population, given that it is influenced by a range of factors including access to health care, nutrition, living conditions and lifestyle. Gaps are stark and striking. For instance, life expectancy for Inuit in Canada is 72.4 years versus 82.9 years for Canada's non-Indigenous population.
- 52% of Inuit in Inuit Nunangat live in crowded homes, which are associated with high rates of communicable disease such as tuberculosis, as well as other challenges, compared to 9% of Canadians overall
- In 2016 18% of Northwest Territories households required major repairs compared to the Canadian rate of 6.5%
References to social challenges, and especially those affecting the Indigenous peoples of the region, were common during the framework engagement sessions. Statistics make it clear that not everybody is similarly disadvantaged. For instance, income inequality does not only exist between the Arctic and the North and the rest of Canada; there is also considerable income inequality within the region itself. The median before-tax individual income for Inuit in Inuit Nunangat is 75% lower than for non-Indigenous residents.
While some of the highest median and average incomes in Canada are found in the region, this should not mask the fact that the costs of living and the rates of poverty and food insecurity are also among the highest in the country. In 2017, for instance, the Nunatsiavut Government Household Food Security Survey identified that food insecure households in Nunatsiavut are over 4 times the level reported in Newfoundland and Labrador, and over 5 times the level of food insecurity in Canada overall.
The deep and ongoing impact on Indigenous peoples of the residential school experience and the broader colonial legacy were consistent themes at regional roundtables, especially when participants spoke of language and culture, education and Indigenous knowledge. Some participants called upon the framework to support the implementation of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission Calls to Action. Links have been made between the intergenerational trauma caused by the impacts of the residential school system and the high rates of substance abuse and suicide in Indigenous populations.
""For many Yukon First Nations, the legacy of colonization continues and the impacts are both real and present. The underlying mental illness experienced by many First Nations is a normal human response to very abnormal conditions brought on by intergenerational impacts of colonization.""
— Yukon First Nations Mental Wellness Workbook
Education and skills development, including early childhood education, improvements in elementary, secondary and post-secondary education, access to higher education as well as the need to enhance opportunities for local higher education in the region, were raised in regional roundtables and other forms of engagement. In written submissions and during stakeholder roundtables, industry representatives talked about the need for more qualified local workers, and about matching education and training with job opportunities. Youth similarly saw education as a path to participating in the local economy, and called for higher-quality education. Participants in engagement sessions described how students from the region graduating with high school diplomas found that their available selection of high school courses or levels of knowledge did not match the requirements of post-secondary education.
- 34% of Inuit in Inuit Nunangat aged 25 to 64 have a high school diploma compared to 86% of Canadians aged 25 to 64 with a high school diploma
- In 2016, nearly three-quarters, 74%, of 25 to 64 year old Northwest Territories non-Indigenous residents had a postsecondary certificate, diploma or degree compared to 43% of Indigenous peoples
""Employment and education are inextricably linked, with 83 per cent of residents 15 years of age and older with post-secondary education having a job, compared to an employment rate of 49 per cent for those without a post-secondary diploma, certificate or degree. Employment and education also have strong linkages to reduced issues related to health, crime and housing.""
— Mandate of the Government of the Northwest Territories 2016–2019 (revised)
The provision of health-care services can be challenging in the Arctic and the North due to the lack of infrastructure and trained professionals, the small populations spread out over vast distances and the need to deliver services in an inclusive, culturally appropriate and responsive manner. Access to health care in the region is currently not comparable to the average Canadian's access to high quality care.
- Hospitals and specialized health services are often not locally available
- Many people are forced to fly out from their home communities to access specialized care, or to give birth
In addition to facing barriers to care, people face disproportionate health challenges.
- In 2014, the rate of new or retreatment cases of tuberculosis was almost 50 times higher in the Inuit population than in the Canadian population overall
Mental health facilities and services are also generally lacking. The severity of mental health challenges in Arctic and northern communities, including the unacceptably high rate of suicide among Indigenous peoples (particularly youth), was a common theme at regional engagement sessions. For example, the rate of self-injury hospitalizations in Labrador is 231 per 100,000. That is more than 3 times the Canadian average. These health outcomes are further complicated by social determinants of health, such as overcrowded housing, high unemployment and low formal education levels.
The importance of local partnerships with municipalities, regional Indigenous associations and development corporations, chambers of commerce and others emerged at roundtable discussions and in written submissions. Local governments, including Indigenous governments and institutions, play a special role in a region which includes urban centres as well as many smaller communities dispersed over large areas.
Municipalities and other forms of local and regional government play key roles in developing and supporting Arctic and northern communities, and are integral to addressing challenges such as housing, health and education.Footnote 6 Many communities are already taking actions that contribute to the goals and objectives of this framework.
""Northern and remote communities play a critical role in delivering essential services. Working with citizens, the private sector, civil society and other orders of government, Arctic municipalities improve the social, economic and environmental well-being of their communities.""
— Jenny Gerbasi, President, Federation of Canadian Municipalities, written submission
Comprehensive infrastructure
Infrastructure concerns were a common theme in engagement, including the need for transformative investments in infrastructure, rather than a remedial approach that only perpetuates a state of crisis.
Almost everyone who spoke about infrastructure mentioned reliable broadband access as a priority, given its role in enabling business, research, education, justice and health.
""With only 1 access into Yukon, 1 misstep from a backhoe operator in British Columbia knocks out the internet across the territory. No telehealth, banking, purchasing of gasoline or supplies, on-line education, and general office use — gone in an instant.""
— Association of Yukon Communities, written submission
""'All weather roads, rail, air and broadband were among the most common topics to arise in conversation in the north.""
— Look North report and action plan
Other highlighted infrastructure needs included:
- improved charting and mapping
- energy infrastructure
- better port facilities
- better airport facilities
- reliable rail networks
- roads to access communities and mineral resources
On a more local level, insufficient housing is a chronic problem in many northern communities. The lack of housing is linked to several other poor health and social outcomes.
- In Nunavik, no communities have all-season roads or connection to a regional energy grid, 58% have suitable housing, and 35% have access to a terrestrial backbone for internet communications.
Rather than simply expressing a desire for greater federal investment, communities and organizations emphasized their desire for partnerships and opportunities to play an active and constructive role in infrastructure investments through, for example, financial partnership, as well as the development of business capacity and skills. They noted that new infrastructure must come with a local capacity to maintain it, and that its construction should bring local jobs and wealth. Territorial governments, through their participation in the co-development process and in strategic documents such as the Pan-Territorial Vision for Sustainable Development, have pointed to large-scale infrastructure investments as foundational to creating economic opportunity and prosperity for Indigenous communities.
The Government of Canada has provided funding to restore rail service on the Hudson Bay Railway Line, which is expected to grow into a key transportation and export hub serving both
international markets and northern Canada. The rail line acquisition by the Arctic Gateway Group represents a historic partnership which combines First Nations and community ownership with private sector leadership. Restoration of the rail line opens the door for economic investments and opportunities for the town of Churchill and northern Manitoba residents and reflects a shared priority to strengthen transportation infrastructure for Canada's Arctic and North.
Strong, sustainable and diversified economies
Economic development was often mentioned by participants as a key theme. Territorial and provincial governments emphasized that regional economies will need to be built upon both sustainable resource extraction and the development of other sectors. They also highlighted that entrepreneurial research and innovation will help in strengthening and diversifying their economies.
""Supporting small business development across the Arctic is key to diversifying the economy, creating sustainable industries that are alternatives to extractive industries, and facilitating young people to stay within their communities rather than having to move for employment.""
— Gwich'in Council International, written submission
- The National Aboriginal Economic Development Board estimated in 2016 that the Indigenous peoples employed in the 3 territories could make an additional $1.1 billion in annual income if they had the same education and training as non-Indigenous people working in the territories
At the roundtables, a thriving economy was linked to foundational elements such as a skilled workforce, social and physical infrastructure, diversity and meaningful opportunities. Stakeholders and experts approached economic development issues from differing perspectives. In public submissions, some saw the answer in more support for non-renewable resource development such as mining. In 2017, mining was the largest private sector contributor to the economies of the Northwest Territories and Nunavut: the 6 mines operating in the territories spent over a billion dollars within the jurisdictions. Documents such as the Pan-Territorial Vision for Economic Development, Quebec's Plan Nord, and Manitoba's Look North Report and Action Plan all highlight the place of resource development in supporting a robust economy.
""Responsible [mining] means meeting socio-economic commitments (including economic, employment and community development commitments); acting in an environmentally responsible manner; and protecting the health and safety of our employees and the Peoples of the North.""
— Mission statement, Northwest Territories (NWT) and Nunavut Chamber of Mines
""The benefits of developing a sustainable, community-driven tourism industry range from healthier lifestyles for youth, to cultural preservation, to new economic opportunities for elders and youth.""
— Parnasimautik Consultation Report, Nunavik
Participants from the business community suggested that by articulating a long-term, strategic vision for the Arctic and the North, the Government of Canada would provide greater certainty for industry and incentivize investments in larger-scale projects. Organizations representing Indigenous economic development corporations and small business interests noted needs for increased access to capital and business supports, as well as more supportive federal procurement policies. There was also a common view that economic development could be facilitated through greater access to international markets. Academics called for the identification and development of alternative economic approaches, including innovation, arts and crafts, and traditional or cultural activities. Some representatives of Indigenous and non-governmental organizations cautioned against a reliance on major projects. They stressed the importance of land-based or traditional economic activity, as well as the potential of ""conservation economies"" focused on connections between culture, communities and local ecosystems.
Science and Indigenous knowledge
""For Inuit, economic development must be guided by Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit (Inuit knowledge)….. Taking this approach applies an Inuit worldview to decisions and action that influence Inuit lives""
— P.J. Akeeagok, President, Qikiqtani Inuit Association, in A New Approach to Economic Development in Nunavut, 2018
At regional roundtables, conversations about knowledge creation often focused on the relationship between communities and researchers, as well as the place of Indigenous peoples in research, including the role of Indigenous knowledge. Participants described both science and Indigenous knowledge as valid and equal contributors to knowledge-building and decision-making in the region. Participants also expressed the desire for stronger local and Indigenous involvement in setting and determining research priorities as well as carrying out research. Prioritizing stronger involvement in the research process means that it is crucial to expand the research capacity of communities and strengthen local and regional research infrastructure and institutions. Indigenous knowledge also has an important role in informing international policies that in turn affect Arctic Indigenous peoples.
""Gwich'in need to be directly represented in the key decision-making forums about research to ensure that research is responding to community desires for information into the issues that are important to them. Moreover, there is a need for increased funding to support the collection and analysis of Indigenous knowledge.""
— Gwich'in Tribal Council, written submission
The importance of social science research was also brought forward, as it can provide an essential evidence base for decisions and policies that meet the needs of Arctic, northern and Indigenous communities. For research to give people a full base for decision-making it should include elements which are not only university-led and partnership-based, but also locally-led and accessible though regionally-based institutions. It was also noted that the vast majority of funds spent on Arctic and northern research are spent in the south. Communities want improved sharing of the results and benefits of research with the communities where the research is being conducted. Many of these points brought up in engagement sessions are also emphasised by territorial research documents and Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami's National Inuit Strategy on Research.
Protecting the environment and conserving biodiversity
""For Inuit the purpose of conservation is the creation of socio-economic and cultural equity between Inuit and all other Canadians, while considering reconciliation, climate change, and, ecological integrity.""
— Qikiqtani Inuit Association (Nunavut), written submission
The social and environmental impacts of climate change were recurring themes at all regional roundtables. Those impacts affect a broad range of issues, from infrastructure to housing to security. At stakeholder roundtables, many people felt that adaptation activities should take precedence over mitigation actions in the region, considering its small emissions footprint versus the magnified impacts. Another key message was the need for more robust mitigation activities from southern Canada and major international emitters.
Conservation issues drew a varied response. Some engagement participants emphasized the need to reduce development impacts on wildlife. The harvesting of country foods, particularly caribou herds, provides nutrition, food security and the continuation of traditional practices for many Indigenous peoples. Others expressed concerns over the weight of regulation and its impact on resource development. Co-management of renewable resources was highlighted as a venue for collaborative management that can help integrate different viewpoints. There was a recognition that protected areas are unable to guard Arctic and northern ecosystems against pollution and climate change with distant origins. There was also acknowledgement that a holistic approach to conservation activities can make an overall positive contribution to the region. Suggested options for such an approach included:
- the advancement of concepts such as Indigenous-led conservation and monitoring
- Indigenous protected and conserved areas
- conservation economies, through which conservation becomes an integral aspect of local economies
The global context
""As we see it, the barriers to feeling empowered and healthy are not neatly segmented into 'domestic' and 'international' boxes. As a nation which spans across territorial and international boundaries, the issues that concern Gwich'in are at the same time both local and international.""
— Gwich'in Council International, written submission
There were some consistent key messages on international issues raised by participants from all regions. They included a desire to maintain the circumpolar Arctic as a region of peace and cooperation through efforts to strengthen the international rules and institutions that govern the Arctic. Preserving the role of the Arctic Council as the leading forum for circumpolar cooperation was singled out as a priority by many participants.
Engagement participants would also like to see Canada target its international cooperation in areas that improve socio-economic living conditions. For example, strengthening north-to-north cooperation through forums such as the Arctic Council and at the sub-national level was encouraged, including exchanges of knowledge and best practices on issues such as:
- mental wellness
- education
- Indigenous languages
- renewable energy
Indigenous participants were particularly interested in improved mobility of Indigenous peoples and cultural goods throughout the circumpolar region. Participants called for:
- strengthening the voice of Indigenous peoples in international Arctic forums including increased support for the Indigenous Permanent Participants at the Arctic Council
- Canada to take a strong stand on protecting Indigenous rights to self-determination, pursuing sustainable harvesting of flora and fauna and combatting international efforts that negatively affect these rights
People who spoke or wrote in also expressed a desire to see Canada play a leadership role on the global stage when it comes to addressing climate change, contaminants and other environmental challenges that have a disproportionate impact on the region.
Safety, security and defence
Throughout the engagement process, participants highlighted the transformative role of climate change in increasing commercial interest and activity in the region. Questions around environmental protection and response, safe regional transportation, and search and rescue capabilities were raised as critical issues, especially in the context of a rapidly changing climate.
In response to rapid regional changes, roundtable participants recognized the need for a whole-of-government approach to safety, security and defence. As part of this, increased presence in the region by the Canadian Armed Forces and the Canadian Coast Guard was highlighted as an important response, in conjunction with clear communication and engagement with local people. The Canadian Rangers were identified as an important presence in the region, and support was expressed for enhancing and expanding the Rangers' training and effectiveness. In addition, participants expressed appreciation for the way in which the Canadian Armed Forces consult local communities and Indigenous groups, and called for such collaboration to be continued.
Participants noted that partnering with communities and investing in regional infrastructure will solidify Canada's regional presence while exercising its sovereignty, and that existing partnerships can be expanded through collaboration, information sharing and training.
Indigenous youth
""Youth across the Arctic understand that education is a portal to opportunity. They aspire to a quality education equivalent to other Canadians: an education that also reaffirms the central role of their culture and Indigenous languages in their identity as Canadians. A new Arctic Policy Framework, if it is to separate itself from many previous documents on the future of the Arctic, must speak to these young voices in this era of reconciliation.""
– A New Shared Arctic Leadership Model
Youth are transforming the region by their very numbers: in Canada, the median age is just over 40; in Nunavut, it is just over 26. These booming populations of young people are producing many great successes as artists, as leaders and in other walks of life. However, figures show that there are still many obstacles and challenges to being well, succeeding at school and finding meaningful work.
""To move forward in any aspect in life and in our society, we need to be educated. The youth want to be well with who they are and where they come from. Youth also understand the importance of quality, formal education so they can become active members of their communities and society and have access to all levels of employment in the communities, region or elsewhere if that is what they choose.""
— Qarjuit Youth Council, Nunavik
Today's young Indigenous leaders are eager to build upon the work of previous generations. As stated in the report We Are One Mind, Perspectives from Emerging Indigenous Leaders on the Arctic Policy Framework, the Arctic and Northern Policy Framework must be people-centric to be effective. The report, which was developed by the Indigenous youth collectives Dene Nahjo, Our Voices and Qanak, contains 25 recommendations organized under 3 themes:
- Northerners leading northern policy engagement
- Investing in land, language and culture for future generations and as the basis for a healthy society
- Healthy lands, healthy economies
The report urges the federal and territorial governments to act in a timely manner to resolve existing unsettled land claims and self-government agreements. It recommends the establishment of a ministerial working group to review federal legislative impediments that exclude northerners from accessing federal programs or impose inappropriate regulations on people and communities, and recommends that the federal and territorial governments update their consultation frameworks to address gaps and redundancies.
Our future
The Government of Canada and its partners will close the gaps and divides that exist between this region, particularly in relation to its Indigenous peoples, and the rest of the country. The clear and ambitious goals and objectives of this framework point the way to a vibrant, sustainable and prosperous future.
In our shared future, Canada's Arctic and North will no longer be pushed to the margins of the national community.
- Its people will be full participants in Canadian society, with access to the same services, opportunities and standards of living as those enjoyed by other Canadians
- The resources required for their physical and mental wellness will be accessible
We will endeavour to create an environment in the Arctic and North in which youth will get the education they need to thrive, and Indigenous peoples receive the support required for their languages and cultures to be not only maintained, but revitalized.
We will encourage development that is environmentally and socially sustainable, that employs local people and creates wealth in the region. Stewardship of Arctic and northern lands, waters and resources will be accomplished through new and existing measures, including support of Indigenous stewardship and Indigenous protected and conserved areas. The Pikialasorsuaq (North Water polynya) between Canada and Greenland and Thaidene Nëné National Park Reserve in Northwest Territories are 2 examples of proposed Indigenous protected areas.
We will work to fill knowledge gaps in the Arctic and the North in a way that is responsive to the needs of local governments and people, and enables and encourages their participation in all aspects of the research process. We will define knowledge inclusively, embracing the contributions of Indigenous knowledge as well as western science.
We will support a rules-based international order in the Arctic that prioritizes human and environmental security and meaningful engagement of Arctic and northern peoples, especially Indigenous peoples. We will reduce barriers to the freedom of Indigenous peoples to move freely across international boundaries that now separate families and cultures.
Realizing this shared future will mean doing things differently to address persistent social and economic challenges in the Arctic and the North. We know that closing the gaps between the region and the rest of Canada means closing gaps between where decisions and resources are based, and where the needs are. Closing the gaps requires greater effort, focus, trust and collaboration, and more self-determination for the peoples of the region.
Reconciliation with Indigenous peoples
""Recognizing …the disproportionate socio-economic and cultural inequity facing Inuit compared to most other Canadians, and committing to working in partnership to create socio-economic and cultural equity between Inuit and other Canadians. This commitment includes energetically and creatively pursuing the socio-economic, cultural, and environmental conditions of success through the full implementation of land claims agreements as well as reconciliation""
— Inuit Nunangat Declaration on Inuit-Crown Partnership
Ongoing reconciliation with Indigenous peoples is foundational to achieving the goals and objectives of the Arctic and Northern Policy Framework.
The negotiation and full implementation of land claims and self-government agreements are key components of reconciliation. They require recognition within the framework as part of the continuation and renewal of relationships. These continued and renewed relationships come with a strong foundation, including the Principles Respecting the Government of Canada's Relationship with Indigenous Peoples.
In 2015, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau accepted the Final Report of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission on behalf of the Government of Canada and committed to a renewed nation-to-nation relationship with Indigenous peoples based on recognition of rights, respect, co-operation and partnership.
In 2016, the Government of Canada committed to renewing the relationship with First Nations, Inuit and Métis peoples through the creation of permanent bilateral mechanisms.
- All 4 Inuit regions have settled land claims
- Agreements on land and governance rights have been signed with First Nations and Metis across much of their traditional territories in the Arctic and the North
The fundamental instruments that define the Indigenous-Crown relationship are treaties, historic and modern, underpinned by section 35 of the Constitution Act of 1982. Each treaty established a unique relationship between Indigenous peoples and various levels of government. These relationships provide the foundation for a just and lasting reconciliation, founded in the honour of the Crown with federal, provincial and territorial governments. Implementing modern treaties is a shared responsibility, which Canada will work with Indigenous peoples, provinces and territories to realize.
The work of reconciliation is not only happening at the federal level, it has also been undertaken by Indigenous peoples, by Arctic and northern governments and through other mechanisms. Reconciliation in the region is intertwined with political evolution and is ongoing. Progress has been made on this path, led in large part by Indigenous and non-Indigenous citizens who have worked together to secure and implement land and self-government agreements, evolve public governments, and find practical ways to work together for the shared goals of improving the quality of life for their children and sound stewardship of land and resources.
Assuming global leadership
Canada will strengthen its international leadership on Arctic and northern issues at this critical time, as the region undergoes rapid environmental change and international interest surges.
Canada's ambition is to robustly support the rules-based international order in the Arctic, and all its institutions, and to seek ways to strengthen and improve those institutions for the 21st century.
Canada will:
- work collaboratively with Indigenous peoples and territorial and provincial governments in the multilateral forums where decisions that impact the Arctic are made, including the Arctic Council and United Nations organizations
- enhance bilateral cooperation with Arctic and key non-Arctic states and actors
Canadian leadership will be advanced bilaterally and in multilateral forums in order to promote Canadian values and interests such as human and environmental security.
Our shared ambition includes:
- better leveraging our international Arctic engagement to address domestic priorities such as social and economic development
- enhanced knowledge of our Arctic and North
- environmental protection
In a globalized world, many of the issues facing Canada, including in the Arctic and the North, cannot be addressed effectively through domestic action alone. A whole-of-government effort that leverages both domestic and international policy levers is therefore required. For example, economic growth in Canada's Arctic and North can be facilitated through infrastructure investments that increase access to world markets, along with trade commissioner services to help businesses based in the region access international markets and attract and retain foreign direct investment that benefits Northerners and respects Canada's national interest.
Promoting sustainable development
A key international commitment that informs this framework is the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Canada has committed to implementing and measuring progress toward these goals.
The United Nations 2030 Sustainable Development Goals
- End poverty in all its forms everywhere
- End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture
- Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages
- Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all
- Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls
- Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all
- Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all
- Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all
- Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation
- Reduce inequality within and among countries
- Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable
- Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns
- Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts
- Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development
- Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss
- Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels
- Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development
Adopted in 2015, the 2030 Agenda is an ambitious 15-year global framework with 17 goals that cover the economic, social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development, and integrate peace, governance and justice elements. It is universal in nature, meaning that implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals is a commitment to take action domestically within Canada, as well as internationally, to eradicate poverty and leave no one behind.
These goals fit well with what we have heard regarding the need to narrow gaps between Arctic and northern Indigenous peoples and other Canadians. We intend to match our ambition in the framework, domestically and internationally, to the ambition expressed in the Sustainable Development Goals. This ambition is expressed in the framework's goals and objectives, and aligns closely with the Pan-Territorial Vision for Sustainable Development principle that ""the territories will stand together to create long term sustainable development of northern economies."" The Pan-Territorial Vision indicates that this will be achieved through environmentally responsible and sustainable resource development, job creation and economic diversification.
A safe and secure Arctic and North, now and into the future
The qualities that make the Canadian Arctic and North such a special place, its size, climate, and small but vibrant and resilient populations, also pose unique security challenges, making it difficult to maintain situational awareness and respond to emergencies or military threats when and where they occur. These difficulties are often compounded by the effects and accelerating pace of climate change, making the region both environmentally changed and increasingly accessible to a broad range of actors and interests.
To protect the safety and security of people in the region and safeguard the ability to defend the Canadian Arctic and North, and North America now and into the future, a multi-faceted and holistic approach is required. The complexity of the regional security environment places a premium on collaboration amongst all levels of government, Indigenous peoples and local communities, as well as with trusted international partners, and we will continue to improve the ways we work together to keep pace with the evolving challenges.
The Government of Canada is taking steps to augment its Arctic and northern footprint in support of regional safety and security, including through Canada's defence policy Strong, Secure, Engaged, and through key elements of the Oceans Protection Plan. Canada will enhance the Canadian Armed Forces' presence in the region over the long term by setting out the capability investments that will give the Canadian Armed Forces the tools they need to help local people in times of need and to operate effectively in the region.
Under the Oceans Protection Plan, the Canadian Coast Guard will continue to enhance its:
- maritime search and rescue capacity, including through an expanding Coast Guard Arctic Auxiliary
- capacity to respond to maritime environmental emergencies
- icebreaking capacity
- its capacity to contribute to Maritime Domain Awareness
Canada's ability to respond to regional challenges, provide security and ensure compliance with our laws and regulations largely depends on our ability to build and maintain a comprehensive picture of what is happening across the region, as gaps can have life-threatening consequences. For example, increased maritime and cross-border traffic creates new challenges for border enforcement and effective vessel tracking, such as illicit drugs and illegal imports. This is why it is so critical for partners to work together to develop strong domain awareness, including through information sharing, enhanced coordination, the acquisition of new air, land, sea and space-based capabilities, and exploration of innovative solutions to surveillance challenges in the Arctic and the North.
Goals and objectives
Goal 1: Canadian Arctic and northern Indigenous peoples are resilient and healthy
There are unacceptable gaps in health and social development outcomes between Arctic and northern Indigenous peoples and most other Canadians. The poor health outcomes in the region are directly linked to both inadequate access to treatment options and to serious social problems, including:
- a critical shortage of housing
- low educational attainment levels
- high rates of incarceration and unemployment, particularly in smaller communities
Climate-driven changes are worsening the risks to Indigenous peoples in the region, such as travel over traditional routes. As well, a high cost of living and changes in the availability and accessibility of traditional foods have resulted in rising rates of food insecurity. For example, 1 in 2 households in Nunavut are food insecure. Eliminating food insecurity includes both affordable food from the grocery store, as well as having access to traditional food to support a healthy diet, community well-being and connection to local cultures and traditions.
Life expectancy is a key index of a population's wellbeing. Projected life expectancy for Inuit in Canada is 10.5 years below that of Canada's non-Indigenous population. While the most recent Statistics Canada information on First Nations and Métis is not disaggregated by region, at a national level First Nations and Métis were found to have a projected life expectancy rate of approximately 4 to 5 years below that enjoyed by non-Indigenous Canadians.
- One study shows that northern populations suffer from the lowest life expectancy in Canada
- Another study finds that life expectancy is approximately 7 to 12 years lower in areas with a high concentration of Inuit, First Nations and Métis
- Rates of communicable disease and suicide are much higher among Arctic and northern Indigenous populations than elsewhere in Canada
- Violence is being perpetrated against Indigenous women and girls, with the likelihood of violent death being significantly higher for Indigenous than for non-Indigenous women, according to statistics cited in the 2019 final report of the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls
Together, we will close these stark gaps, taking a distinctions-based approach that respects the unique rights, interests and circumstances of Inuit, First Nations and Métis peoples.
Meeting this goal will depend on progress on other objectives, including economic development, public safety, justice and reconciliation. Adaptation and resilience-building measures will be required to respond to the climate-driven change happening now, and projected for the future. Cultural revival will play a role in resilience. Land-based activities and practices will support education, healing and well-being. Solutions advanced in other Arctic states that face similar challenges will also be examined. Strong communities in our North can be supported by the circumpolar exchange of knowledge and best practices. Freer movement of Indigenous peoples and cultural goods across Canada's international boundaries in the Arctic and the North will further strengthen long-standing familial and cultural ties.
Goal 1 objectives
- End poverty
- Eradicate hunger
- Eliminate homelessness and overcrowding
- Reduce suicides
- Strengthen mental and physical wellbeing
- Create an environment in which children will thrive, through a focus on education, culture, health and well-being
- Close the gaps in education outcomes
- Provide ongoing learning and skills development opportunities, including Indigenous-based knowledge and skills
- Strengthen Indigenous cultural and family connections across international boundaries
- Address the systemic causes of all forms of violence against Indigenous women and girls
- End the over-representation of Indigenous peoples in Canada's criminal justice system
- Implement culturally-appropriate approaches to justice issues, such as restorative justice measures and other alternative measures to incarceration
Goal 2: Strengthened infrastructure that closes gaps with other regions of Canada
As a gap experienced by every person in the Arctic and the North, infrastructure is a top priority of this framework. Canada is investing in transformative infrastructure corridors to achieve more efficient and effective communications, clean energy and transportation. We also need to address deficits in weather and climate monitoring, particularly in climate-sensitive sectors. The National Aboriginal Economic Development Board has estimated that every dollar invested in transportation and energy infrastructure can generate more than 10 times that amount.
We commit to creating economic opportunity and prosperity for northerners, and to better enabling Canada's northern and Arctic regions to catch up to other areas of Canada.
There are significant transportation infrastructure deficits in the region.
- Approximately 70 communities are only accessible year-round by air, or seasonally by water or ice roads
- Marine and aviation infrastructure is the gateway for many northern and Arctic communities and needs improvement
The limited transportation infrastructure makes it difficult, time-consuming and expensive to move passengers and goods in and out of communities, and to deliver government programs and services. Infrastructure deficits are also a significant restriction on trade and commerce.
Climate change threatens the resilience of existing infrastructure and presents challenges to constructing new infrastructure. The costs, sustainability and reliability of energy are a concern, with nearly two-thirds of Arctic and northern communities relying exclusively on diesel, which is expensive, difficult to transport and a source of greenhouse gases.
Many communities rely exclusively on satellite for access to internet services; they lack access to the fast, high quality and reliable telecommunications networks that people need to enable economic growth, education, health and research.
Goal 2 objectives
- Investment in significant infrastructure projects
- Fast, reliable, and affordable broadband connectivity for all
- Expand multi-modal transportation infrastructure and operations to connect communities to Canadian and international opportunities and improve access to essential services
- Develop multi-purpose corridors for broadband, energy and transportation, including connections to hydroelectricity grids
- Achieve energy security and sustainability in all communities and improve access to reliable, affordable and clean energy solutions
- Integrate climate change resilience into new and existing infrastructure
- Strengthen community-level infrastructure, including social infrastructure
- Enhance monitoring infrastructure for the collection and use of weather and climate data
Goal 3: Strong, sustainable, diversified and inclusive local and regional economies
A strong economy contributes to the resilience of Arctic and northern communities and sustainable growth that benefits all Canadians. However, northern economic development is challenged by higher operating costs for businesses due to the region's small and dispersed population, sparse infrastructure and higher energy and connectivity costs.
Limited access to formal or higher education, a barrier to local participation in the workforce, especially amongst Indigenous peoples, highlights the need for policies which aim to foster increased mobility as a means of supporting education and employment paths.
For many small businesses, access to professional support, such as banking and legal services, is limited. As stated in the Pan-Territorial Vision for Sustainable Development, ""responsible, sustainable resource development and job creation is the cornerstone of the territorial economies. Indigenous ownership, investment and participation in the resource industry are key to the success of this sector."" There is also a need to grow other areas to help insulate northern economies from the ""boom and bust"" cycle, and to provide more diversity of opportunity for Arctic and northern peoples. This will grow the middle class and build a diverse, prosperous and truly inclusive economy, where all can realize their full potential.
We will support local economies, such as sealing, fishing, hunting and crafts. Measures aimed at fostering innovation, diversification and promoting access to domestic and foreign markets will support both existing and future economic activities.
Achieving sustainable economies will also require the provision of long-term employment and other benefits to Arctic and northern people, along with a central role in decision-making. The resolution of land and governance rights and the negotiation of benefits underpin economic development. Canada is committed to meaningfully consult with Indigenous peoples on resource and infrastructure projects in the decision-making process, in accordance with Aboriginal and treaty rights. Fulfilling consultation obligations while respecting the decision-making roles of Indigenous groups recognized within modern treaties can help realize inclusive economies.
Many areas within the region are expecting growth over the next decade, capitalizing on their considerable economic potential. Much of the growth will come from the natural resource sector, as well as other sectors such as:
- tourism
- commercial fisheries
- cultural industries
Certain economic sectors, including resource development, tourism and shipping, are expected to grow as climate change alters the northern environment, though these activities bring new risks for people, infrastructure and ecosystems and place additional stress on search and rescue and disaster response capacity. To ensure that local and regional economies are able to grow sustainably, climate change considerations will need to be taken into account.
International trade and foreign investment are important contributors to growth, by helping Arctic and northern businesses:
- take advantage of global export opportunities made possible by existing and new free trade agreements
- attract and retain foreign direct investment in a way that enhances economic development and environmental protection while ensuring Canada's national security interests
Goal 3 objectives
- Increase Indigenous participation in the economy
- Grow the northern and Arctic economy, to the benefit of Northerners and all Canadians
- Increase retention of wealth in Canada's Arctic and North
- Reduce income inequality
- Drive innovation and support investments in cold climate resource extraction
- Optimize resource development, including the mining and energy sectors, while ensuring that this development is undertaken in a responsible, sustainable and inclusive manner
- Provide the necessary supports to help businesses grow
- Building on a strong economic base, foster economic diversification through innovation and partnerships
- Enhance opportunities for trade and investment
- Maximize economic opportunities flowing from infrastructure investments
Goal 4: Knowledge and understanding guides decision-making
Canada's Arctic and North is a region of significant interest to scientists and other researchers, domestically and internationally. Ongoing research and observation in the region seek to address knowledge gaps. Mapping and understanding climate change impacts, vulnerabilities and avenues to adaptation and resilience are keys tasks for research. Other tasks range from geological mapping to tracking species distribution to understanding the socio-economic and cultural impacts of development.
Arctic and Northern peoples want those knowledge gaps filled, but they also want changes to the way knowledge is gathered, created and shared. Our approach to Arctic and-northern research will feature:
- stronger regional and Indigenous involvement in the research process, including:setting prioritiesundertaking research itselfenhanced community-based observation
The research agenda will include more social science research to meet the pressing needs of communities. Indigenous knowledge and scientific knowledge will be equally considered in decision-making.
Collaboration at the international level plays a major role in addressing gaps in our knowledge of the region, particularly given the complexities, interconnectedness and costs related to Arctic and northern science.
Internationally, Canada will:
- bolster its efforts to champion Indigenous knowledge
- facilitate stronger international research collaboration
Indigenous knowledge holders as well as academic institutions and research facilities relating to natural sciences, social sciences and health have built an international reputation for high-quality knowledge and research, though more meaningful and equitable partnerships with Indigenous researchers and institutions must be achieved. The Canadian High Arctic Research Station campus in Nunavut is the newest addition to the pan-northern and Arctic network of research infrastructure welcoming scientists from all over the world.
Goal 4 objectives
- Ensure that Arctic and Northern people, including youth and all genders, play a leading role in developing research and other knowledge-creation agendas
- Ensure that Arctic and Northern people have the tools and research infrastructure to participate in all aspects of the knowledge creation process
- Increase support for health, social science and humanities research
- Create and store knowledge in a manner consistent with the self-determination of Indigenous peoples, balancing ethics, accessibility and culture
- Increase international polar science and research collaboration with full inclusion of Indigenous knowledge
- Work with partners to implement their research strategies
- Develop innovative technological solutions on widely-shared community and economic development needs
- Support development of data collection, production and measurement specifically focused on Arctic and Northern populations
- Reduce barriers to accessing research funding for Indigenous knowledge holders and organizations
Goal 5: Canadian Arctic and northern ecosystems are healthy and resilient
Climate change is a lived reality for Canada's Arctic and northern residents. The temperature in the Canadian Arctic has increased at a rate of 2 to 3 times the global average, which has placed immense pressure on Arctic and northern communities, ecosystems and infrastructure.
Rising temperatures are also:
- having widespread impacts on terrestrial and marine ecosystems
- exacerbating the effects of existing threats to biodiversity, such as:habitat shiftsinvasive alien species
Urgent action is needed to:
- mitigate climate change
- adapt to its current and future impacts
- promote and build resilience through efforts that:increase the availability of, and access to, locally relevant information for decision-makingbuild capacity to reduce risk
Environmental data gathered from information and warning services on weather, water, ice, climate and air quality are an important foundation for situational awareness and can be leveraged to better understand the impacts and risks of changing environmental conditions.
Addressing critical gaps in earth observation across Canada's Arctic and North, and adapting these services to the unique context and evolving needs of the region, will be essential to support effective decision-making.
This will enable communities to be:
- more prepared for emergencies
- better informed
- resilient when it comes to facing the challenges posed by climate change
Minimizing other environmental pressures, such as pollution, will help to reduce adverse effects. Sustainable management of natural resources, conservation of biodiversity and the safeguarding and restoration of ecosystems are necessary to protect the Arctic and northern environment and communities. Indigenous peoples continue to play a unique role in stewardship of northern ecosystems, including through guardians programs, which work to protect sensitive areas and species, monitor ecological health and maintain cultural sites.
Some of the most pressing environmental issues affecting Canada's Arctic and North, from climate change to contaminants to marine pollution, cannot be managed through domestic action alone as the sources of the problems largely originate in areas outside of the region. While these environmental issues are global in scope, there is a disproportionate impact on the health of northern Canadians, in particular on Indigenous peoples who live off the land. For this reason, Canada will play a leadership role in advocating for more timely and ambitious international action to address environmental challenges that have an impact on Arctic and northern environments and peoples.
Goal 5 objectives:
- Accelerate and intensify national and international reductions of greenhouse gas emissions and short-lived climate pollutants
- Ensure conservation, restoration and sustainable use of ecosystems and species
- Support sustainable use of species by Indigenous peoples
- Approach the planning, management and development of Arctic and northern environments in a holistic and integrated manner
- Partner with territories, provinces and Indigenous peoples to recognize, manage and conserve culturally and environmentally significant areas
- Facilitate greater understanding of climate change impacts and adaptation options through monitoring and research, including Indigenous-led and community-based approaches
- Enhance support for climate adaptation and resilience efforts
- Enhance understanding of the vulnerabilities of ecosystems and biodiversity and the effects of environmental change
- Ensure safe and environmentally-responsible shipping
- Decommission or remediate all contaminated sites
- Strengthen pollution prevention and mitigation regionally, nationally and internationally
Goal 6: The rules-based international order in the Arctic responds effectively to new challenges and opportunities
The circumpolar Arctic is well-known for its stability and high level of international cooperation, a product of the robust rules-based international order in the Arctic that Canada played an instrumental role in shaping. The rules-based international order is the sum of international rules, norms and institutions that govern international affairs. It benefits the national and global interest by fostering peace and stability for the Arctic; conditions which are necessary for Arctic and northern communities to thrive socially, economically and environmentally.
The international order is not static; it evolves over time to address new opportunities and challenges. The Arctic and the North is in a period of rapid change that is the product of both climate change and changing geopolitical trends. As such, international rules and institutions will need to evolve to address the new challenges and opportunities facing the region. As it has done in the past, Canada will bolster its international leadership at this critical time, in partnership with Northerners and Indigenous peoples, to ensure that the evolving international order is shaped in a manner that protects and promotes Canadian interests and values. These interests and values are widely shared by Arctic states and include:
- improving the lives of Indigenous peoples and Northerners
- protecting the region's fragile environment
- strengthening the voices of Northerners, especially Indigenous peoples
The international rules and institutions that form part of the rules-based international order will also play a critical role in helping Canada resolve our outstanding boundary disputes and continental shelf overlaps in the Arctic.
Goal 6 objectives
- Bolster Canadian leadership in multilateral forums where polar issues are discussed and decided upon
- Enhance the representation and participation of Arctic and northern Canadians in relevant international forums and negotiations
- Strengthen bilateral cooperation with Arctic and key non-Arctic states and actors
- Define more clearly Canada's marine areas and boundaries in the Arctic
Goal 7: The Canadian Arctic and North and its people are safe, secure and well-defended.
In the Arctic and the North, as in the rest of Canada, safety, security and defence are essential prerequisites for healthy communities, strong economies and a sustainable environment. Climate change is having far-reaching effects on the lives and well-being of northerners, threatening food security and the transportation of essential goods and endangering the stability and functioning of delicate ecosystems and critical infrastructure.
As the region becomes increasingly accessible due to the effects of climate change and improvements in cold-weather technologies, the region is emerging as an area of international strategic, military and economic importance, with both Arctic and non-Arctic states expressing a variety of interests in the region's potential.
- Steady increases in domestic and foreign-based tourism, scientific research and commercial activities are being experienced in the Canadian and circumpolar Arctic.
- There is also increased vessel traffic through the various waterways commonly referred to as the ""Northwest Passage,"" which is part of Canada's internal waters.
The relationship between the land and these waterways is unique in Canada's north. For thousands of years, the Inuit have lived on; traveled across; and hunted, fished and trapped in the Canadian Arctic, making no distinction between the frozen land and the frozen sea. These practices continue and remain vital to Inuit culture and the Inuit economy today.
In today's increasingly complex Arctic and northern environment, the continued safety and security of the North depends on strengthened emergency management and community safety, including the enhanced presence and ability to respond of security providers, such as the:
- Canadian Armed Forces
- Royal Canadian Mounted Police
- Canadian Border Services AgencyFootnote 7
Strengthened emergency management requires a coordinated strategy, including enhanced participation of Indigenous representatives; this will be essential in building community resilience and capacity against emergencies and natural disasters.
Northern communities experience multiple risk factors and other challenges that affect their ability to respond to crime issues, such as remote geographical location and limited capacity. Culturally-sensitive crime prevention and community safety planning initiatives build knowledge and capacity that are required in order to support healthy, safe and stronger communities.
Improved situational awareness, including through NORAD and the Maritime Security Operations Centres, will also be key to protecting our north now and into the future. In this context, Canada will:
- continue to demonstrate its sovereignty
- defend North America from conventional and advanced military threats
- protect the integrity and sustainability of our northern economy, environment and critical infrastructure
- ensure a safe and secure transportation system
- safeguard the technological advantage that the Canadian Armed Forces rely on to defend our north
- effectively manage border security
- enhance the ability of the Canadian Coast Guard to help provide partners with essential Maritime Domain Awareness
- support the safety and prosperity of northern peoples and communities
Collaboration among all levels of government, with Indigenous and northern peoples and communities, and with international allies and partners, will be important.
Goal 7 objectives
- Strengthen Canada's cooperation and collaboration with domestic and international partners on safety, security and defence issues
- Enhance Canada's military presence as well as prevent and respond to safety and security incidents in the Arctic and the North
- Strengthen Canada's domain awareness, surveillance and control capabilities in the Arctic and the North
- Enforce Canada's legislative and regulatory frameworks that govern transportation, border integrity and environmental protection in the Arctic and the North
- Increase the whole-of-society emergency management capabilities in Arctic and northern communities
- Support community safety through effective and culturally-appropriate crime prevention initiatives and policing services
Goal 8: Reconciliation supports self-determination and nurtures mutually respectful relationships between Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples
In its final report, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada describes reconciliation as ""establishing and maintaining a mutually respectful relationship between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal peoples in this country. In order for that to happen, there has to be awareness of the past, acknowledgement of the harm that has been inflicted, atonement for the causes and action to change behaviour.""
The Qikiqtani Truth Commission based in Nunavut also called for a new relationship between government and Qikiqtani Inuit grounded in ""awareness and acknowledgement of past wrongs, and commitment on both sides to collaborate in building a better future."" In recent years, the Government of Canada has publicly recognized the negative impacts of its past policies upon Indigenous peoples, for instance through the:
- Statement of Apology to Former Students of Indian Residential Schools in 2008)
- Apology for the Inuit High Arctic relocation in 2010
- Statement of Apology on Behalf of the Government of Canada to Former Students of the Newfoundland and Labrador Residential Schools in 2017
The Government of Canada will continue to redress past wrongs, acknowledge harm and raise awareness. The government is also working to take actions to improve and renew relationships with Indigenous peoples through distinctions-based approaches that respect the unique rights, interests and circumstances of Inuit, First Nations and Métis peoples. The Government of Canada is moving towards the recognition and implementation of rights as the basis for Canada's relationship with Inuit First Nations and Métis. Canada has also committed to exploring new ways of working together, including through the Inuit-Crown Partnership and the other permanent bilateral mechanisms formed to jointly advance shared priorities.
The improvement and devolution of governance to give all people in Canada's Arctic and north more control over their lives will underpin reconciliation, build long-term capacity and contribute to the building of healthier and more resilient communities. The vast majority of Indigenous self-governments are found in the north. Innovative approaches to self-determination have also been established through public governments.
One of the roles of the federal government is to advance self-determination for Canada's Arctic and northern residents, including the devolution of province-like powers to territorial governments. This helps enable a locally-based approach to reconciliation, to be undertaken together by the peoples of the Arctic and north.
In addition to the recognition of rights and innovative forms of governance and collaboration, reconciliation in Canada's Arctic and north means closing the socio-economic gaps that exist between Arctic and northern Indigenous peoples and other Canadians. Canada will work with Indigenous governments and organizations, territories, provinces and other partners to close these gaps. This will be achieved, in part, through the implementation of the:
- Calls to Action of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada
- United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples
- goals and objectives articulated in this framework
Goal 8 objectives
- Honour, uphold and implement the rights of Arctic and northern Indigenous peoples, including those outlined in historic and modern treaties and in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples
- Change federal operating practices and processes in support of increased self-determination and representation of Arctic and northern Indigenous peoples, and recognize the unique operating environment of various Indigenous and public governments in the Arctic and north
- Ensure that Arctic and northern Indigenous peoples have the opportunity, choice and capacity to enter into treaties, agreements and other constructive arrangements with the Crown that provide a foundation for ongoing relations
- Reclaim, revitalize, maintain and strengthen the cultures of Arctic and Northern Indigenous peoples, including their languages and knowledge systems
- Complete outstanding devolution commitments, including the devolution of land, inland waters and resource management in Nunavut
- Work with Indigenous governments and organizations, provinces, territories and other partners to close socioeconomic gaps between Arctic and northern Indigenous peoples and other Canadians
- Continue to redress past wrongs against Indigenous peoples
Conclusion: Next steps
The development of this framework has strengthened collaborative relationships between framework partners and among federal government departments. This development of new ways of working together is, in itself, a significant achievement.
In the second phase of the framework, governance mechanisms will be co-developed through discussions among framework partners, the governments and Indigenous peoples' organizations that worked together on the first part of the framework. These mechanisms will describe how partners will regularly collaborate to share information and assess progress on framework implementation, building on significant developments in governance over the last 50 years. Governance mechanisms will:
- support the jurisdictional and institutional landscape created by devolution, modern treaties and land claim and self-government agreements
- adhere to the principles of partnership articulated in A New Shared Arctic Leadership Model, the final report of Mary Simon, the Minister's Special Representative on Arctic Leadership
- meet partners' expectations for meaningful, ongoing involvement in policy decisions related to their interests
- provide a forum for all partners to be regularly convened for collaborative discussions on implementation of the framework
- commit to reconciliation in the context of renewed federal-provincial-territorial-Indigenous relationships
- ensure that existing fora, such as the Inuit Crown Partnership Committee, the Yukon Forum, and the Intergovernmental Council of the Northwest Territories, are leveraged to assist in implementation
- reflect the authorities and powers of territorial, provincial and Indigenous governments
Financial investment in the framework will be an integral element of its success. Partners will work together to develop an implementation and investment plan. The plan will outline how new investments together with other economic and regulatory levers will be used to contribute to implementation of the framework.
The implementation and investment plan will:
- define new investments
- provide information on how partners' funding initiatives are aligned with and supportive of the goals and objectives described in the ANPF policy statement, including in partner chapters
- provide strategic alignment and flexibility of investments to accommodate the unique nature of 'doing business' in the Arctic and north
- define indicators, data collection and reporting commitments related to specific funding and initiatives
Annex: Principles for the Arctic and Northern Policy Framework
The principles below were developed to provide continuing guidance on implementation of the framework.
- Decisions about the Arctic and the North will be made in partnership with and with the participation of northerners, to reflect the rights, needs and perspectives of northerners
- The rights and jurisdictions of Canada's federal, territorial, provincial Indigenous and municipal governments will be respected
- Development should be sustainable and holistic, integrating social, cultural, economic and environmental considerations
- Ongoing reconciliation with Indigenous peoples, using the work of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission as a starting point, is foundational to success
- As climate change is a lived reality in the region, initiatives will take into account its various impacts, including its impact on Indigenous northerners, who continue to rely on the land and wildlife for their culture, traditional economy, and food security
- Policy and programming will reflect a commitment to diversity and equality, and to the employment of analytical tools such as Gender-Based Analysis Plus to assess potential impacts on diverse groups of people
- The framework will respect a distinctions-based approach to ensure that the unique rights, interests and circumstances of Inuit, Arctic and northern First Nations and Métis are acknowledged, affirmed and implemented
- The Government of Canada recognizes Inuit, First Nations, and Métis as the Indigenous peoples of Canada, consisting of distinct, rights-bearing communities with their own histories, including with the CrownThe work of forming renewed relationships based on the recognition of rights, respect, co-operation and partnership must reflect the unique interests, priorities and circumstances of each people
- Every sector of society, from the private sector to universities and colleges, the not-for-profit sector, community-based organizations and individual Canadians, has an important part to play in building a strong Canadian Arctic and North.
Introduction to partners' chapters
The content in the Arctic and Northern Policy Framework was discussed over the course of more than a year by the partners in the co-development process. The ideas, the aspirations, and the goals and objectives are the result of the meeting of many minds and perspectives. This often meant compromise on the part of governments and Indigenous partners as we strove for consensus. As part of the development of the framework, we decided it was important for partners to be able to express themselves directly, to lay out their visions, aspirations and priorities. While the framework chapters are an integral part of this process, they do not necessarily reflect the views of either the federal government, or of the other partners.

Still, the Arctic is home to more than 21,000 species: mammals, birds, fish, invertebrates, plants and fungi (Arctic Biodiversity Assessment 2013: Species Diversity in the Arctic).
Arctic animals and plants have adapted to cold and dark in many ways. The species of animals that live all year round in the north are characterised by a thick coat of fur or feather that keeps them warm in frost and wind. The animals store fat before winter and use the snow cover as a protection against the cold.
Adaptation to changing conditions is facilitated by factors related to the activities and characteristics of the animals, such as changes in colour and metabolism. Some animals hibernate during the winter to survive the long winter. Migratory birds, for their part, prefer the Arctic in the summer, when there is plenty of food and sunlight.
During the short growing season, the plants make effective use of the rays of the sun, for example, with their low structure and cup-like flowers. Wax or hair on stems, leaves and buds protect the plants from wind and cold.

The Arctic is changing. As retreating ice cover makes this region more accessible, nations with Arctic real estate are thinking of developing these subzero landscapes and the resources below.
As the Arctic evolves, a vast amount of resources will become more accessible and longer shipping seasons will improve Arctic logistics. But with a changing climate and increased public pressure to limit resource development in environmentally sensitive regions, the future of northern economic activity is far from certain.
This week’s Chart of the Week shows the location of major oil and gas fields in the Arctic and the possible new trade routes through this frontier.
A Final Frontier for Undiscovered Resources?
Underneath the Arctic Circle lies massive oil and natural gas formations. The United States Geological Survey estimates that the Arctic contains approximately 13% of the world’s undiscovered oil resources and about 30% of its undiscovered natural gas resources.
So far, most exploration in the Arctic has occurred on land. This work produced the Prudhoe Bay Oil Field in Alaska, the Tazovskoye Field in Russia, and hundreds of smaller fields, many of which are on Alaska’s North Slope, an area now under environmental protection.
Land accounts for about 1/3 of the Arctic’s area and is thought to hold about 16% of the Arctic’s remaining undiscovered oil and gas resources. A further 1/3 of the Arctic area is comprised of offshore continental shelves, which are thought to contain enormous amounts of resources but remain largely unexplored by geologists.
The remaining 1/3 of the Arctic is deep ocean waters measuring thousands of feet in depth.
The Arctic circle is about the same geographic size as the African continent─about 6% of Earth’s surface area─yet it holds an estimated 22% of Earth’s oil and natural gas resources. This paints a target on the Arctic for exploration and development, especially with shorter seasons of ice coverage improving ocean access.
Thawing Ice Cover: Improved Ocean Access, New Trading Routes
As Arctic ice melts, sea routes will stay navigable for longer periods, which could drastically change international trade and shipping. September ice coverage has decreased by more than 25% since 1979, although the area within the Arctic Circle is still almost entirely covered with ice from November to July.
|Route||Length||Ice-free Time|
|Northern Sea Route||4,740 Nautical Miles||6 weeks of open waters|
|Transpolar Sea Route||4,179 Nautical Miles||2 weeks of open waters|
|Northwest Passage||5,225 Nautical Miles||Periodically ice-free|
|Arctic Bridge||3,600 Nautical Miles||Ice-free|
Typically shipping to Japan from Rotterdam would use the Suez Canal and take about 30 days, whereas a route from New York would use the Panama Canal and take about 25 days.
But if the Europe-Asia trip used the Northern Sea Route along the northern coast of Russia, the trip would last 18 days and the distance would shrink from ~11,500 nautical miles to ~6,900 nautical miles. For the U.S.-Asia trip through the Northwest Passage, it would take 21 days, rather than 25.
Control of these routes could bring significant advantages to countries and corporations looking for a competitive edge.
Competing Interests: Arctic Neighbors
Eight countries lay claim to land that lies within the Arctic Circle: Canada, Denmark (through its administration of Greenland), Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden, and the United States.
There is no consistent agreement among these nations regarding the claims to oil and gas beneath the Arctic Ocean seafloor. However, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea provides each country an exclusive economic zone extending 200 miles out from its shoreline and up to 350 miles, under certain geological conditions.
Uncertain geology and politics has led to overlapping territorial disputes over how each nation defines and maps its claims based on the edge of continental margins. For example, Russia claims that their continental margin follows the Lomonosov Ridge all the way to the North Pole. In another, both the U.S. and Canada claim a portion of the Beaufort Sea, which is thought to contain significant oil and natural gas resources.
To Develop or Not to Develop
Just because the resources are there does not mean humans have to exploit them, especially given oil’s environmental impacts. Canada’s federal government has already returned security deposits that oil majors had paid to drill in Canadian Arctic waters, which are currently off limits until at least 2021.
In total, the Government of Canada returned US$327 million worth of security deposits, or 25% of the money oil companies pledged to spend on exploration in the Beaufort Sea. In addition, Goldman Sachs announced that it would not finance any projects in the U.S.’s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
The retreat of Western economic interests in the Arctic may leave the region to Russia and China, countries with less strict environmental regulations.
Russia has launched an ambitious plan to remilitarize the Arctic. Specifically, Russia is searching for evidence to prove its territorial claims to additional portions of the Arctic, so that it can move its Arctic borderline — which currently measures over 14,000 miles in length — further north.
In a changing Arctic, this potentially resource-rich region could become another venue for geopolitical tensions, again testing whether humans can be proper stewards of the natural world.",,Nicholas LePan,Energy|Mining|Oil and Gas|Maps,,2019-12-20,Visual Capitalist

What's At Stake
One of the last unspoiled wild places on earth is at risk of being opened up to oil drilling.
Gray wolves, musk oxen, caribou, and imperiled polar bears roam the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge’s 19.6 million acres. Migratory birds visit from all 50 states and six continents. These lands—first recognized with federal protections 60 years ago—are vital to the culture and survival of the indigenous Gwich’in people, who have relied on the Arctic Refuge for thousands of years.
But in a move that will hasten climate change and have devastating consequences for people, wildlife, and pristine public lands, the Trump administration pushed a reckless plan to begin oil and gas lease sales within the refuge’s coastal plain—an area that the Gwich’in have called “the sacred place where life begins.” At the same time, the administration moved to allow dangerous seismic testing on the coastal plain. Seismic testing would be incredibly destructive to wildlife—taking place in critical habitat for polar bears, right in the middle of denning season—and the fragile landscape.
NRDC has been calling for nationwide opposition and helping to lead the charge against this assault on the refuge, as well as other attempts to drill and destroy public lands and waters in the Arctic region. we will work with Indigenous leaders and the Biden administration to fully protect these lands. The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is the last place for oil and gas drilling.

ABSTRACT
The Diavik mine, located in the Archean-age Slave geologic province in northern Canada, is one of the world’s preeminent sources of gem diamonds. Since mining operations began in 2003, it has produced over 100 million carats of diamonds. This article will review the discovery, development, and operation of the mine, which is situated in a remote subarctic setting in the Northwest Territories. Four kimberlite pipes occur in close proximity—three are being exploited, while the fourth will be brought into production in 2018. Diavik is now expected to operate through 2024; upon closure, the equipment, buildings, and infrastructure will be removed and the land returned as closely as possible to its original condition.
INTRODUCTION
Canada is the world’s fourth-largest diamond producer, with most of that output coming from one area near Lac de Gras in the Northwest Territories. The discovery of kimberlite pipes there in the early 1990s led to the development of several major mines. Diamond-bearing kimberlite deposits that can be mined economically are noteworthy, since only about 50 such occurrences have been found worldwide since the 1870s, mainly in Australia, Angola, Canada, Russia, and South Africa (Janse, 2007). As of mid-2016, Canada has three active mines: Ekati and Diavik (figure 1), located about 30 km from each other in the Northwest Territories (figure 2), and the Victor mine in northern Ontario. Snap Lake, recently placed in a care and maintenance status, lies within 80 km of Ekati and Diavik. Two other Canadian mines are under development: Gahcho Kué in the Northwest Territories and Renard in Quebec. Figures from the Kimberley Process (www.kimberleyprocess.com/en/canada) show that Canada produced 11.6 million carats of rough diamonds in 2015, valued at US$1.675 billion.
This article will discuss the discovery, development, and operation of Diavik, one of the richest diamond mines in the world. Over several days in late June 2015, the authors visited the site to capture photographs and gather information on the mining operations. The visit involved tours of the open pit and underground workings, the processing and recovery plant, and the facility in Yellowknife where diamonds are cleaned and sorted for distribution (figure 3). In this article, we focus on the unique engineering challenges in developing the Diavik mine and recovering diamonds from beneath a lake in a harsh sub-arctic environment, all while doing so in a way that protects the environment, ensures worker safety, and respects the cultural traditions of the local indigenous peoples.
DIAMOND EXPLORATION IN CANADA
Canada is the world’s second-largest country in terms of land area, but until the 1990s it was not considered an important source of gemstones. During the preceding century, alluvial diamonds were occasionally found in scattered locations across southern Canada and the northeastern United States (Hausel, 1995). Their association with glacial sediments in the Great Lakes region led Hobbs (1899) to propose that the diamonds had been transported by the southward movements of glaciers (which covered large portions of Canada during the Pleistocene epoch, from 2.5 million until about 12,000 years ago) from unknown source rocks in the area near Hudson Bay (see also Bell, 1906).
Kjarsgaard and Levinson (2002) presented a comprehensive review of the discovery and development of Canada’s diamond mines through the 1990s. Although the north-central areas of the country were known to be underlain by ancient rocks of Archean age—the rocks that also host diamondiferous kimberlites in southern Africa and elsewhere—there was little effort on the part of large mining companies to search for diamonds in the Slave craton (Pell, 1995; Carlson et al., 1999). Along with the vast expanse of territory, the very small target area presented by kimberlite pipes, and the cost of search efforts over a period of years, those authors suggested two additional reasons for the lack of diamond exploration programs in northern Canada. The first was logistical: the remoteness of the area, much of it covered by water, and the harsh climate that limited the field season for exploration. The second reason was the glacial dispersal of the contents of exposed kimberlite pipes by the movement of ice sheets away from the original pipe locations. New geological exploration techniques, similar to those being used in Siberia, were needed to search for diamondiferous kimberlites in this type of terrain, which is much different from that of southern Africa (McClenaghan and Kjarsgaard, 2001).
According to Kjarsgaard and Levinson (2002), the modern era of diamond exploration in Canada began in the early 1960s with the traditional search for the diamond “indicator minerals” (such as red Cr-rich pyrope garnet, green Cr-diopside, green olivine, black ilmenite and black Cr-spinel). These minerals, which weather out of kimberlites but are retained as colorful grains in alluvial sediments in far greater abundance than the similarly resistant but much rarer diamonds (Gurney, 1984; McClenaghan, 2005; Shirey and Shigley, 2013). The discovery of these minerals signaled the presence of kimberlites in a particular area, and chemical analysis of them could distinguish those pipes that might contain diamonds. In Canada, the search for these minerals would ultimately involve years of lonely work in a nearly uninhabited and inhospitable region (Krajick, 2001).
The topography of northern Canada has been significantly influenced by periods of glaciation in the geologic past. The land is relatively flat to slightly undulating, marked by low barren hills and shallow bodies of water. In this setting, diamond prospectors had come to believe that sampling glacial eskers (narrow, sinuous ridges composed of sand and gravel sediments deposited by streams from melting glaciers) for indicator minerals might prove successful in locating kimberlites. This had been the case with searching for similar minerals in stream sediments in nonglaciated terrains (McClenaghan et al., 2000; McClenaghan and Kjarsgaard, 2001). Initial target areas included northern Ontario and portions of Quebec, followed by a shift in exploration toward the north and west of the country.
Diamond prospectors who previously found indicator minerals along the Mackenzie River Valley in the Northwest Territories realized that the westward movement of glaciers had transported these minerals from source rocks near the center of the continent. In the early 1980s, improved airborne geophysical survey methods for locating small-target kimberlite pipes over a wide area, combined with a better understanding of how to check sediments from both glacial moraines and eskers, led to preliminary diamond discoveries in various parts of the country. After these initial finds, however, the idea of a more extensive search for diamonds in northern Canada was met with skepticism. Initial exploration efforts involved several major mining companies, but the search was primarily undertaken by smaller companies and even groups of individual prospectors.
In April 1990, after a decade of exploration across an east-west distance of 1,200 km in the Northwest Territories, came Chuck Fipke’s discovery of a bright green Cr-diopside crystal on a ridge at Point Lake, a small, circular crater-like lake just north of Lac de Gras. As this mineral does not survive travel far from its source rock, he concluded that it had come from a kimberlite pipe in the immediate vicinity. This led Fipke and his partner in Dia Met Minerals, fellow geologist Dr. Stewart Blusson, to stake a claim. Years later this area would become part of the Ekati mine (Fipke et al., 1995). Additional heavy mineral samples collected north of Point Lake confirmed the presence of a kimberlite pipe. Partnering with BHP Minerals, a large international mining company based in Australia, they obtained drill core samples from the pipe to better evaluate its mineral content and structure.
In November 1991, BHP announced that 59 kg of kimberlite core samples from the site contained 81 small gem-quality diamonds, and that the company would spend up to $500 million to develop a mine. Over the next 12 months, this stunning development triggered the biggest land rush in Canadian history, as mining companies and individual prospectors staked claims over some 22,000 square kilometers in the north-central part of the country (Krajick, 1994, 2001; Boyd, 2006).
Over the past 25 years, exploration efforts have identified more than 500 kimberlite pipes throughout Canada, with more than 50% containing traces of diamonds. Most of these occurrences are located in the Lac de Gras region near the center of the Slave craton (Carlson et al., 1999). Few of these pipes are directly exposed at the surface; most are buried beneath bodies of water, and they have been revealed by geophysical and field sampling techniques. Because kimberlites weather and decompose faster than much older surrounding rocks, the pipes often occur in topographic depressions beneath lakes. By the end of 1994, a total of 39 kimberlites had been identified in the Lac de Gras area, including what would become the country’s first diamond mine: Ekati, which opened in the fall of 1998. Because these kimberlite pipes were located in an ecologically sensitive portion of northern Canada, the mining ventures had to undergo an extensive environmental, economic, and social review involving several government agencies and local indigenous communities before proceeding with development.
DISCOVERY AND HISTORY OF DIAVIK
By early 1992, Aber Diamond Corporation had staked a claim to 3,250 square kilometers in the Diavik area. The company began a helicopter-borne magnetic survey (in partnership with Kennecott Canada, the exploration arm of Rio Tinto) to identify target locations as prospective kimberlite pipes (Carlson et al., 1999; Graham et al., 1999). A Yellowknife-based exploration company (Covello, Bryan & Associates) was hired for the prospecting activities. Ground, gravity, and other geophysical measurements were also made to confirm that the targets were kimberlites, and to better delineate the size of potential pipes. Samples collected from glacial till, streams, and beaches around these locations were analyzed for indicator minerals. When potential targets were detected, they were ranked in order of priority for additional study based on their geophysical characteristics and proximity to the indicator minerals. Core drilling of the most promising sites was then carried out to determine the lateral extent of the pipe and its micro-diamond content.
Indicator minerals were first discovered on the Diavik property in 1994, near what was then designated as the A21 anomaly, but the decision was made to first core-drill the nearby anomaly that later became the A154 (South) pipe. This drilling produced a section of kimberlite core that broke open to reveal a 2.5 ct diamond crystal (Graham et al., 1999; Tupper and Neamtz, 2002). Considering the rarity of diamonds in kimberlite pipes, to encounter such a large crystal in a random core section was remarkable. In 1995, the adjacent A418 pipe was evaluated for its diamond potential. Drilling revealed that the geomagnetic anomalies were small, steeply inclined, semicircular volcanic pipes that became narrower with depth.
By 1995, four diamond-bearing kimberlite pipes had been located—all beneath the waters of Lac de Gras. The pipes are adjacent to the lake shoreline and lie within 4 km of one another. Additional core drilling was carried out to carefully delineate the sizes and shapes of the pipes, and their potential diamond grade was estimated from analyzing the drill cores. Between 1996 and 1997, the initial pipes—A154 (which was later found to be two adjacent pipes) and A418—were accessed by several large-diameter (approximately 15 cm) holes, core drilling to depths of about 250 meters, and then by underground tunnels excavated 150 meters beneath Lac de Gras. From these activities, 5,937 tonnes of kimberlite ore were recovered from the A154 South and A418 pipes. Evaluation of this bulk sample was critical to determining whether the pipes contained enough high-quality diamonds for mining to be economical. Some of the recovered ore was analyzed at the company’s pilot processing plant in Yellowknife, and the rest was split into two portions for separate evaluation at both the Yellowknife plant and the nearby Ekati mine. In 1998, analysis of 21,013 carats of diamonds (one-third of which were gem quality) recovered from the bulk ore sample provided the first evidence of the mine’s economic potential.
Earlier in 1995, hydrological and geotechnical studies were begun to assist in the conceptual design and development of both the open-pit and planned underground mining operations. These studies have continued to the present day.
Despite the environmental and engineering challenges for large-scale mining in this remote region, Rio Tinto and Dominion Diamond Corp. (formerly Aber) established a formal joint venture in 1999 to develop the property. Rio Tinto managed and operated the mine through a wholly owned subsidiary, Yellowknife-based Diavik Diamond Mines Inc. Diamond production would be divided between the two organizations, with each independently marketing its own share.
In addition to examining the economic feasibility of operating a diamond mine under arctic conditions, the developers conducted environmental risk analysis between 1997 and 2000. A scientific assessment of all aspects of the regional environment provided a baseline to measure the impact of the subsequent construction and operation of the mine. Agreements also needed to be signed with the five First Nations—the Lutsel K’e Dene First Nation, the Yellowknives Dene First Nation, the Tlicho Government, the Kitikmeot Inuit Association, and the North Slave Metis Alliance—which had inhabited the area for centuries. These groups sought the protection of land and lakes and a share of the economic benefits from mining. In 2000, formal permission was granted to the joint venture to begin mine construction. This included an environmental agreement with the Canadian government, and a socioeconomic monitoring agreement with the government of the Northwest Territories.
Between 2000 and 2003, approximately CAD$1.3 billion was spent building the mine infrastructure, one of the largest capital investments undertaken in the history of Canadian mining. This included a plant to process the kimberlite ore and recover the diamonds, office and accommodation buildings for several hundred staff, utilities (electric power and heat generation, water supply, and wastewater treatment), bulk fuel and explosive storage, a maintenance shop, a containment area for storing the processed kimberlite, and an airstrip capable of handling cargo and passenger aircraft. Development of the site occurred in a relatively uninhabited arctic tundra setting—the closest indigenous community was 190 km to the southwest. Everything needed to construct and maintain the site had to be flown in from Yellowknife or trucked over an ice road during wintertime. Transition from a construction project to active diamond production commenced in January 2003, with an expected mine lifetime of about 16–22 years. Sales of the first rough diamonds began in the summer of that year.
In 2006 and 2007, another group of bulk kimberlite samples was collected underground at each of the three pipes (A154, A418, and A21) to determine underground mining conditions, to compare the impact of drill and blast mining versus machine mining on diamond value, and to provide about 15,000 carats from each pipe for additional estimations of rough diamond values. With the exception of the data on diamonds from A21, these 2006–2007 estimates have been superseded by more recent information obtained from actual production parcels from A154 (117,000 and 118,000 carats in May 2013) and A418 (186,000 carats in May 2012). Since 2003, the mine has yielded 100 million carats of rough diamonds, with the largest crystal found to date weighing 187.7 ct (figure 4). Named the “Diavik Foxfire,” it was produced between May 31 and June 6, 2015 (see the Lab Notes section of this issue, pp. 188–189). Previously, the largest gem-quality diamond recovered weighed 151 ct.
GEOLOGICAL SETTING
This kimberlite province, discovered in 1991 and measuring about 400 × 750 km, is a portion of the Slave craton, a region of the continental lithospheric plate (also known as the Canadian Precambrian Shield) that has remained geologically stable since Archean times 2.5 to 4 billion years ago (Pell, 1997; Bleeker, 2002; Davis et al., 2003; Canil, 2008; see boxes A and B and figure 5). In this region, the rocks that compose the ancient crust are exposed at the surface by glaciation. The craton consists of granites and gneisses, with younger volcanic and metasedimentary rocks deposited on them. It sits above a mantle “keel” (a downward-protruding thickened portion of the lithosphere) where relatively low heat-flow and reducing conditions have remained suitable for diamond formation and preservation for an extended period of geologic time (Shirey and Shigley, 2013). Explosive kimberlite magma eruptions rising through this keel zone brought diamonds to the crust. This is a typical setting for kimberlite pipes in Archean cratonic rocks worldwide.
Subsequent to kimberlite pipe emplacement, this portion of Canada was covered by a glacial ice sheet that culminated about 20,000 years ago. As stated above, this glaciation removed much of the topography of the area, including the upper portions of the kimberlite pipes. On East Island, where the Diavik mine is located, the kimberlite pipes are hosted in approximately 2.5-billion-year-old Archean granitic host rocks as well as some younger metasediments. Several Proterozoic diabase dikes cut through zones of structural weakness in these granitic rocks—these same zones may have been where exploding kimberlite magmas broke through to the surface.
Kimberlite pipes are the near-surface conduits of kimberlite volcanoes. As no such eruption has ever been observed, the geological understanding of these events is based almost entirely on observations of the pipes’ complex vertical structure obtained from drill core sections or exposed during underground mining, and from petrographic analysis of rocks found within the pipes (Moss et al., 2008). As in many other kimberlites worldwide, a complete understanding of the magma eruption process is often hindered by subsequent erosion, which removes important upper sections of a pipe.
More than 400 kimberlite pipes are now known in the Lac de Gras area (W. Boyd, pers. comm., 2016). They are distributed along a northwest-trending axis extending more than 120 km. Only a few are economic to mine for diamonds. The Diavik mine lies near the center of the Slave craton. The geology of the four kimberlite pipes on the mine property is now well understood based on field studies conducted over the past two decades (Graham et al., 1999; Bryan and Bonner, 2003). Kimberlites at the mine are interpreted as representing coherent pyroclastic and volcaniclastic types of igneous rocks, and the pipe emplacement has been dated at 55 ± 5 million years ago, during the Eocene epoch (Graham et al., 1999). The pipes are up to 20,000 square meters at the surface, and they extend down to depths of at least 600 meters. Each has a different mixture of kimberlite types and country rock. Field studies of the A154 pipe by Moss et al. (2008) revealed a poorly sorted massive volcaniclastic kimberlite overlain by a better-sorted stratified volcaniclastic kimberlite containing variable proportions of consolidated mud and, at the top of the sequence, a graded pyroclastic kimberlite. The pipes are capped by several meters of glacial till, a thin layer of lacustrine sediments, and 15–20 meters of lake water. Moss et al. (2008) proposed a six-stage explosive eruption model for the A154 pipe:
- Initial kimberlite eruption and excavation of the pipe to form a vertical pipe beneath a surface crater
- Collapse of the pyroclastic gas cloud from above, and partial infilling of the upper portion of the pipe with massive kimberlite from below
- Flows of debris from the surrounding crater walls and further infilling of the pipe, leading to the formation of the stratified kimberlite
- Alteration of rocks within the crater by hot circulating fluids originating from groundwater interacting with the underlying kimberlite magma
- Deposition of sediments in the upper portions of the crater, which now lie beneath a lake
- Deposition of pyroclastic kimberlite in the crater by material ejected from adjacent kimberlite eruptions
At Lac de Gras, glaciation removed the top portions of the pipes. When exposed at the surface, kimberlites weather and decompose, becoming softer than the surrounding country rocks. With the retreat of the glaciers, the pipe locations often became depressions in the land surface, which filled with water to become lakes. The lakes at pipe locations are generally deeper than those formed by just glacial action.
Careful documentation of the different types of kimberlite (and other rocks) within a pipe is important because these factors can exert some control over the size and abundance of the diamonds, and on the processing of the material as kimberlite ore. This typically involves analyzing hundreds of ore samples.

These vestiges of ancient rock are the rarest, smallest, and oldest remnants of continental crust and immediately underlying 150–200 km of mantle (together known as the continental lithosphere). The Diavik mine lies in the middle of the Slave craton, which derives its name from the Great Slave Lake at its southern border. An exciting feature of the Diavik kimberlites, besides their abundance of diamonds, is that the kimberlite punctures and carries deeply derived pieces of the mantle from Earth’s ancient past. The geological history preserved in the Slave craton offers a fascinating record, one that can be read from the complicated surface geology and especially from the deep mantle-derived rock samples brought up within the kimberlite.|
Like other cratons (e.g., the Superior in Canada, the Kaapvaal in South Africa, or the Pilbara in Australia), the Slave craton is a complicated collage of different continental terranes created at different times and forced together over more than two billion years. The surface geology reveals the different ages of these units, and how they fit together like puzzle pieces. The vertical sampling of diamonds and mantle and crustal rocks by kimberlite that is then erupted to the surface becomes an invaluable tool to peer through the younger crustal rocks, which have a different surface geology from those at 30 to 150 km depths. With enough kimberlites and enough diamonds made available for study from mining operations, a vertical cross section of the craton can even be constructed (figure B-1).
At the surface of the Slave craton, the oldest rocks, some ranging in age up to 4.2 billion years, are exposed in the Acasta Gneiss Complex (AGC) on the far west side of the craton and in a north-south belt of gneisses known as the Central Slave Basement Complex (CSBC) in the center. Within these ancient complexes themselves, almost 1.4 billion years of geological evolution can be measured by radiometric dating methods. To the east of the CSBC, the surface rocks are all much younger, more granitic, and clearly related to the modern process of plate tectonic subduction that operated from the craton’s eastern side about 2.5 billion years ago (Bleeker, 2002). Surprisingly, the diamondiferous kimberlites in the Slave craton have erupted through the craton east of the CSBC—coming clearly through parts of the craton that are dominated by younger rocks (most typically 2.5 billion years). Because the diamonds in the Diavik and other kimberlites are much older (up to 3.5 billion years) and similarly old mantle xenoliths occur in the kimberlites, the deep mantle keel must reside some 100 km below younger crust. The surface geology of the Slave craton, therefore, is an asymmetrical geological construct whose depths are known because of diamondiferous kimberlite eruptions.
LOCATION AND ACCESS
The Diavik mine is located at 64°29ʹ46” N and 110°16’24” W, on a small island in Lac de Gras about 300 km northeast of Yellowknife (the capital of the Northwest Territories), and 220 km south of the Arctic Circle. The mine is situated in a continuous permafrost zone 100 km north of the tree line (the latitude above which trees cannot survive the cold temperatures). The permafrost layer extends from two meters below the surface down to a depth of about 250 meters. The bedrock consists of glacially eroded granite that is covered in many places by glacial till. The till is composed of sand, gravel, cobbles, and boulders in varying proportions in a rock flour matrix. Near the lake shorelines, the finer material has been washed out, leaving mainly boulders. Beneath the lakes, the till is overlain by several meters of fine sediment.
Summers at the site are short and cool, while the winters are long and extremely cold. In winter it is not unusual to have weeks with temperatures between –35°C and –40°C, with frequent strong winds making these temperatures feel even colder. Snow may fall in any month of the year, but it normally occurs between October and April. The region receives only about 300 mm of precipitation per year, mainly in the form of snow, so it can be considered an arctic semidesert. Daylight ranges from about four hours per day in winter to as much as 20 hours per day in summer. Throughout most of the year, the mine can only be reached by air. For a brief time in the winter, an ice road provides vehicle access for thousands of tons of equipment, supplies, and fuel (box C). There is no regular road network in this part of Canada.
MINE DESIGN
The fact that the four kimberlite pipes were located beneath Lac de Gras (figure 6) posed an engineering challenge if the pipes were to be exploited. The option of accessing and mining the pipes underground from an onshore portal tunnel was ultimately rejected because it would require leaving too much valuable kimberlite ore in place for structural support directly beneath the lake bed. Therefore, a traditional open-pit approach was chosen to remove the kimberlite from the upper portions of the pipes. However, this would require the construction of specially designed dikes surrounding the pipes to allow the open-pit mining of ore bodies that would otherwise be underwater. This required dredging of the lake, placing several million tons of crushed rock into the lake to create the dikes themselves, anchoring the dikes to the bedrock, transferring fish from the enclosed areas back into the lake, and removing several million cubic meters of water from the enclosed areas. Particular challenges included building the dikes without direct access to the bedrock beneath the lake, working during winter months of intense cold and extended darkness when the lake surface would be frozen, preventing debris from contaminating the lake, the use of local material for dike construction (blasted and crushed granite taken in stages from the open-pit locations), and a heavy reliance on an indigenous community workforce with no experience in heavy civil construction (Olive et al., 2004).
The retention dikes around the kimberlite pipes prevent water from flowing from Lac de Gras back into the open pits and the underground workings. Figure 7 shows that the dike is constructed with a flexible concrete water barrier that is anchored to the pressure-grouted bedrock. This wall is supported on both sides by a large volume of crushed granite waste rock. Several hundred sensors continually monitor temperature, pressure, and ground movement to ensure the structural integrity of the dikes. The ground that acted as the dike foundation was permanently frozen beneath the land surface but not beneath the lake, so special equipment was needed to maintain the permafrost in those locations. Where the dike crosses an island, special refrigeration systems known as “thermosyphons” were installed to remove heat and allow the permafrost below the lake to remain frozen.
The two initial crushed-rock dikes (surrounding the A154 and A418 pipes) total more than five kilometers in length. They stand as high as 32 meters above the lake bed and are wide enough to allow two large vehicles to pass one another. The dikes were constructed using 4.5 million tonnes of granite waste rock.
Because it is so remote, the mine must operate as a self-contained community. The site covers 10.5 square kilometers and contains a dormitory complex, a dining area, recreational and education facilities, an office and maintenance building, a warehouse, and an enclosed maintenance facility where even the largest hauling trucks used at the mine can be worked on year-round. Emergency response and medical services are also available. A 1,600-meter airstrip on the site can accommodate large transport aircraft throughout the year. All principal mine buildings are heated by a boiler plant and connected by elevated, well-lit enclosed corridors so that workers can pass from building to building without being exposed to the harsh winter climate.
Minimal amounts of water are taken from Lac de Gras. A system has been constructed around the island to collect water for reuse or for cleaning in a treatment plant before it is returned to the lake. A separate plant treats all domestic sewage.
A diesel power plant generates electricity for the entire site. A year’s supply of diesel fuel is stored on-site for the power plant as well as the mining vehicles. Excess heat from the power plant is used to warm some of the buildings and to heat water used in processing the kimberlite ore. In September 2012, a wind farm (figure 8) was added to provide a renewable source of electrical energy via a wind-diesel hybrid power plant. The wind farm, the first of its kind in the Canadian subarctic, lowered carbon emissions from the mining operations and reduced the need for diesel fuel to be hauled in.
A separate plant produces crushed granitic rock for dike construction, maintenance of the airport runway and road surfaces, and for use underground to backfill the open tunnels and other workings once the kimberlite ore is removed. Explosives used in mining operations are stored in a secure facility on-site.
MINING AND PRODUCTION
Operations. Open-pit operations on the two ore bodies of the A154 pipe began in January 2003, and mining of the A418 pipe followed in 2007 (figure 9). This type of mining was economically viable because the tops of the kimberlite pipes were within 20 meters of the surface, minimizing the amount of waste rock that had to be stripped away to expose them (figures 10 and 11). Kimberlite ore and granite rock overburden from the pits are hauled away by vehicles, without a system of ore buckets or conveyor belts. As surface mining is more economical than underground operations, the intent was to remove as much kimberlite ore as possible from the open pits over time. But as the pipe became narrower with depth, a point would be reached where ore could no longer be removed by vehicle haulage, and surface mining would then cease. In 2012, after three years and a cost of CAD$800 million, Diavik completed the transition to underground operations for the three pipes being exploited.
In the fall of 2014, Rio Tinto announced plans to develop the fourth kimberlite pipe on the property. Construction of the dike surrounding the A21 pipe will take four years; it will extend 2.2 km and require 3 million tonnes of crushed granite (figure 12). Production from the A21 pit is scheduled to begin in late 2018. Output from this pipe will not appreciably extend the life of the mine. Rather, it will offset the approaching decline in production from the underground operations and allow a continuation of existing kimberlite ore levels through the processing plant for several years.
Diavik’s original plan called for the eventual development of underground mining operations, primarily by ore trucks driving down a tunnel from the surface (figure 13). Prior to tunneling, an extensive geotechnical survey of the hydrogeology of the ore bodies and surrounding host rocks was carried out. The design of the open pits and the choice of surface mining methods took into account that the pits would be directly above the underground workings. To date, some 20 km of interconnected underground tunnels have been constructed. These heated and ventilated tunnels include rescue bays where miners can retreat for safety in emergencies, vehicle repair shops, ore passes, ventilation systems, water pumping stations, and storage areas (figures 14 and 15). The underground tunnels were designed to prevent rock in the overlying open pits from subsiding. Although surface mining of A154 and A418 has finished, the pits are the secondary access to the current underground workings via two entrance portals. Continuous monitoring of the now-unused open pits ensures the structural integrity of the pit walls, preventing breaching of the dikes from the surrounding lake and flooding of the underground workings.
Two types of underground mining were selected based on safety, cost, and other considerations. A technique known as blast-hole stoping (BHS) was chosen for A154N because of the stronger, more competent kimberlite rock in this pipe. It is a bottom-up bulk-mining method in which several days of ore production can be created with a single explosion. Holes are drilled vertically from a higher stope (mining cavity) and filled with explosives. When blasted, the broken ore falls to a lower stope, where it can be removed by a scoop loader and ore hauler. Once all the broken ore is removed, the open lower stope is completely backfilled with cemented waste rock, and the process is repeated at the higher stope.
A top-down bulk-mining method known as sub-level retreat (SLR) is used in the A418 and A154S pipes, where the kimberlite ore is weaker but contained within a more competent granite host rock. In this method, a series of horizontal tunnels on a single level is excavated into the pipe, and sections of ore above the tunnels are broken up using explosives. The broken ore falls into the tunnel and is removed. Once all the ore on the level is removed, a new set of tunnels is created farther down in the pipe, and the excavation process is repeated. The process creates a large open space within the pipe.
All three pipes are being excavated concurrently, and a mixture of both “hard” and “soft” kimberlite ore is sent through the processing and recovery plants. Although the mine was originally designed to handle 1.5 million tonnes of ore, this capacity was expanded to 2 million tonnes through operational improvements without the need for additional capital investment (Diavik diamond mine: 2014 sustainable development report, 2015). Kimberlite ore and waste rock are brought from the underground workings to the surface by haulage trucks using three portal entrances, and the material is dumped in a designated location on-site. Larger trucks haul the ore to the processing plant, and any waste rock goes to a separate dump location (figures 16 and 17). The decision to use trucks to haul ore and waste rock from underground, as opposed to a conveyor belt or ore bucket system, was based in part on the fact that the loaders and trucks from the open-pit mining operations were already available.
The kimberlite ore is processed in a large building on-site (figure 18) that is estimated to be 11 stories high and approximately 150 meters long and 40 meters wide. The ore first passes through a series of powerful magnets, which remove the unwanted pieces of steel mesh that are used to stabilize the tunnel walls. The ore is then crushed to progressively smaller pieces, removing the finer material. Diamonds are separated from the crushed ore by non-chemical, density-based methods to create a diamond-rich heavy-mineral concentrate (figure 19). Next, X-ray sorting uses fluorescence to recover diamonds from the concentrate. The processed ore material is then stored in a designated area on-site.
Although the diamond grade in the Diavik kimberlite pipes is very high compared to other primary mines, diamonds are still in very low concentrations overall, so a large amount of kimberlite ore must be extracted and processed to recover them. As at other major mines, it is always surprising to hear that most workers have “never seen a diamond in the mine.” Processing of the mixed kimberlite ore brought up from the workings of the A154 and A418 pipes involves a complex series of steps to create progressively smaller sizes to liberate the diamonds from the host rock (figures 20 and 21).
Grease tables are used to retrieve diamonds that cannot be efficiently recovered by X-ray fluorescence technology. Recovery of all diamonds takes place in a restricted area of the plant. Under stringent security, all diamonds are weighed, sorted, and documented before being packaged and flown to Yellowknife. At the product splitting facility, the rough diamonds are cleaned, sorted, and valued for government royalty purposes. The diamonds are separated by size for distribution to the two joint-venture partners, according to the production agreement. Once separated, the diamonds follow different paths for manufacturing and marketing.
Personnel. At the end of 2015, Diavik had approximately 1,000 employees, of whom 55% were from the Northwest Territories and 25% from the indigenous communities. Most employees work on a rotation, with two weeks of 12-hour shifts at the mine, followed by two weeks at home. Managerial staff work four days at the mine followed by three days off-site. Employee transportation to and from Yellowknife is provided by company or chartered aircraft. The mine operates around the clock every day of the year.
Safety. An extensive safety management system governs all aspects of mine operations. The system begins with training of all employees, safety standards for every area of activity, and regular reviews to continually monitor and improve safety practices. Before beginning any work activity, employees conduct a quick safety check to identify and discuss potential hazards associated with the activity, as well as preventive measures that can be taken. The entire mine site is inspected regularly by outside agencies to ensure that all operations are conducted in a manner that protects and enhances worker safety and the environment.
Mine safety is particularly critical when operating in a harsh environment (figure 22). In winter, mining activities can be disrupted by whiteout conditions, where the lack of visibility causes spatial disorientation and can be life-threatening. These conditions occur about four times per year and typically last 8 to 12 hours. Weather monitoring is conducted to warn mine staff of whiteout conditions, as well as the onset of very low temperatures.
Production. With the exception of 2009, when demand was low due to the global financial crisis, annual production of rough diamonds at Diavik has consistently surpassed six million carats. As shown in table 1, Diavik’s total mineral reserves at the end of 2015 were 18.7 million tonnes of unmined kimberlite ore containing an average of 2.8 carats of diamonds per tonne, for a total of 52.8 million carats of diamonds as proven or probable reserves. Table 2 presents annual production data from 2003 to 2014.

While the Diavik mine is not known for large diamonds, its kimberlite pipes contain exceptionally high grades (3–5 carats/tonne) of moderate- to high-value diamonds (compared to 0.5 to 1 carats/tonne in other locations). Production from the two operating pipes is valued well above the Kimberley Process average of US$116 per carat—$135 per carat for A154S and $175 per carat for A154N. The average value for A418 is $95 per carat (Dominion Diamonds, 2015).
Diamond crystals from the mine exhibit common forms such as octahedra, dodecahedra, macles, cubes, and aggregate shapes. Colorless crystals predominate, though brown and rarely yellow diamonds also occur; some others have a gray surface coating (Carlson et al., 1999).
CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
Relationship with Indigenous Communities. The 1991 diamond rush transformed the economy and society of the Northwest Territories. The subsequent development of several major diamond mines in this remote region transpired against the backdrop of a new relationship between the mine owners, the national government, and local communities. Over the past four decades, legislation, land claims, and legal challenges have strengthened the rights of Canada’s indigenous communities over the land and water resources within their traditional territory. An important component of this power-sharing and cross-cultural governance over important land-use, environment, and wildlife decisions has been the increasing reliance on management boards with representation from the federal government, the mining companies, and local communities.
The company maintains a socioeconomic monitoring agreement with the territorial government, as well as environmental protection agreements with the indigenous communities and the federal and territorial governments. Councils involving the indigenous peoples have been consulted on a regular basis about mining operations since the discovery of the diamond occurrence in 1993. Discussions with these local groups have prompted revisions to the mine operation and closure plans, and this is expected to continue as long as the mine is in operation.
A representative body called the Traditional Knowledge Panel advises the company based on centuries of local habitation. For example, traditional understanding of wildlife habitats is being incorporated into the reclamation plan for revegetating the area. There was some discussion in this panel of how far to go in the revegetation process. While some people from the community believed that nature would “heal itself,” most panel members understood that environmental disruptions from mine operations were more extensive than naturally occurring events, and that a more aggressive reclamation process was necessary (Diavik diamond mine reclamation review, 2007; Diavik diamond mine: 2014 sustainable development report, 2015).
As the mine was being developed, agreements were put into place to ensure that benefits would be made available to local indigenous communities. These included job training, employment at the mine, and opportunities for local businesses to provide needed services.
Environmental Monitoring and Protection. At Diavik, all mine activities are designed to protect the environment, anticipate potential problems, and meet regulatory requirements. A surveillance network is in place to monitor the water quality in and around the mine. In addition, the effects of mining operations on local wildlife (including caribou, wolverine, bear, and fish) and habitats (e.g., changes in vegetation) are checked on a regular basis. Efforts are made to minimize the production of dust from roadways and the airstrip.
Mine Closure and Reclamation. From the beginning of mine construction, plans were initiated to return the site to its nearly original condition once mining operations cease in 2024. Progressive reclamation of the site has been ongoing and is expected to cost US$131 million by 2030, once all the works have been removed from the site. A group of indigenous community representatives was organized to provide recommendations for the closure plan. They offered suggestions for revegetation and the creation of corridors for local wildlife such as caribou to pass through the mine site after closure. An important subject has been reclamation of the open pits to restore the original shoreline of Lac de Gras. The processed waste kimberlite ore will be sealed in a special containment area. All buildings and other facilities will be dismantled and removed, with the exception of the wind farm, which may be donated to provide electrical power to the community.
The final steps of the closure plan will be very complex. The waste piles must be shaped to match the natural landscape, which is relatively flat with occasional low hills and granite outcrops. The slopes of the piles must be stabilized to prevent them from giving way and endangering people or wildlife. Finally, the results of the reclamation project must have a neutral effect on the balance of nature in the environment. For example, the restored terrain should make it neither easier nor more difficult for migrating caribou to escape while being hunted by the indigenous peoples. Revegetation must not unduly attract caribou to the area or deter them from migrating through it (Diavik diamond mine reclamation review & cost estimate, 2007).
Even though Diavik was the second diamond mine to open near Lac de Gras, the joint venture faced considerable pressure from the local and federal governments, as well as environmentalists, to ensure the mine closure plan would return the land as closely as possible to its original state. This requirement came in response to the estimated 10,000 mining operations in the Canadian north that had closed with little or no reclamation plan, often posing physical or environmental hazards. For example, the Giant mine, a gold recovery operation near Yellowknife, closed in 1999, leaving 237,000 tonnes of toxic arsenic trioxide stored in the abandoned underground workings. Negotiations are still ongoing to decide on an appropriate clean-up plan and who should pay the cleanup costs (“Giant headache,” 2014).
MARKETING OF DIAVIK DIAMONDS
The rough diamond sorting process is highly automated. After recovery, the diamonds are conveyed into a secured section of the plant where they enter sorting units—large metal canisters containing progressively smaller sieves down to 3 mm. At each sieve level, the diamonds are transferred into separate containers and packaged for shipment.
The Diavik mine is jointly owned by Diavik Diamond Mines Inc. (a wholly owned subsidiary of Rio Tinto plc) and Dominion Diamond Diavik Limited Partnership (a wholly owned subsidiary of Dominion Diamond Corporation). From the mine, the sorted diamonds are flown to a product splitting facility near the Yellowknife airport, where they are divided between the two owners—60% to Rio Tinto and 40% to Dominion Diamonds.
Rio Tinto. This Anglo-Australian mining conglomerate owns a 60% stake in the Diavik mine, which produced 6.7 million carats in fiscal year 2015. It also owns a 100% stake in Australia’s Argyle diamond mine and sells that production in lots separate from Diavik. Rio Tinto markets all of its rough diamonds (figure 23) from a sales office in Antwerp, where it sold 70% of its four million carats from Diavik in 2015 at set prices to 17 “Select Diamantaires” who specialize in manufacturing and distributing Canadian rough and polished diamonds. These clients receive Diavik product via two-year supply contracts (Krawitz, 2015). Like De Beers, Rio Tinto schedules 10 sales, called “core sales,” each year.
Five times per year, Rio Tinto also auctions key assortments from its production to engage with customers outside of its Select Diamantaire base. The company sells fancy-color diamonds and rough diamonds larger than 10.8 ct through two “Specials” tenders each year.
Rio Tinto, under its “Diamonds with a Story” platform, promotes Diavik’s pure and clean Canadian origin and unique provenance. Downstream of the mine, Rio Tinto works in partnership with its Select Diamantaires to provide a tracking system, from the mine to the consumer, for Diavik diamonds (R. Ellison, pers. comm., 2016).
Dominion Diamond Corporation. Dominion Diamonds was originally the Canadian diamond exploration company Aber Resources, which discovered the Diavik site. Dominion owns 40% of the mine; the remainder is held by Rio Tinto, which developed the facility. Aber changed its name to Harry Winston Diamond Company in 2006 after acquiring the venerable jewelry retailer. In 2013, Harry Winston sold its retail division to Swatch, the Swiss-based luxury group, and became Dominion Diamond Company. The same year, the company acquired a majority share in the Ekati mine for $553 million. Dominion markets all of its Ekati and Diavik production separately.
In fiscal year 2015, Dominion sold 3.014 million carats of Diavik’s production for US$351.6 million, averaging about $117 per carat. By the end of 2015, according to Dominion’s annual report, the average per-carat price slipped to $105.
Dominion markets most of its Diavik and Ekati production through its sales offices in Antwerp. About 10% of its production is sold to clients in India ($30.4 million, against total sales of $351.6 million for fiscal year 2015). Initially, the mining companies in northern Canada set aside 10% of their production for local polishing operations (Krawitz, 2014). In 2008 there were six diamond polishing plants in Yellowknife, employing 150 workers (“Diamond cutting and polishing,” 2008). By the following year, however, they all had closed, unable to compete with operations in India and China; this resulted in the loss of CAD$22 million in territorial government investments (Danylchuk, 2011). Attempts to revive a large cutting industry in Yellowknife have not succeeded, and currently there is only one cutting and polishing plant operating (Danylchuk, 2015).
Despite the demise of the local cutting industry, Dominion invested CAD$600,000 in 2015 in branding Diavik and Ekati diamonds by reviving the CanadaMark, a marketing program that was suspended after the local diamond operations closed. The CanadaMark brand is a mine-to-market custody chain designed to give diamond buyers the assurance that their purchases have been ethically sourced in Canada and processed by approved manufacturers. The diamond manufacturers selected to produce the CanadaMark come from the company’s existing customer base in India and Israel, and they are continually audited to ensure sourcing and quality standards. Participating manufacturers offer the CanadaMark diamonds to retail clients who have signed up for the program.
Dominion targets the younger generation through various social media platforms and traditional advertising in print magazines. This age group is very concerned about ethical sourcing, so the chain-of-custody audit is necessary to provide this as well as the assurance that the diamond is truly Canadian.
Dominion hopes CanadaMark diamonds will eventually carry a premium over unbranded diamonds. The company’s focus group research indicates that Canadian consumers will pay as much as 10% more, while buyers in the U.S. and Europe are willing to pay an additional 4% to 5%. Chinese buyers, however, noted they were unwilling to pay any premium based on country of origin (B. Bell and J. Pounds, pers. comms., 2015).
STUDIES OF THE DIAMONDS
Donnelly et al. (2007) presented results from a study of 100 inclusion-bearing Diavik diamonds that had been selected from more than 10,000 carats of “run of mine” production. They found that 83% of the diamonds were derived from peridotitic mantle source rocks, with Mg-chromite and olivine by far the most common mineral inclusions. Van Rythoven and Schulze (2009) examined inclusions and crystal morphology in a group of 110 Diavik diamonds. They also concluded that the majority were peridotitic, and that multiple growth and resorption events had affected diamonds from the A154 South pipe.
To further characterize the production from Diavik, in 2015 GIA acquired over 777 carats from Dominion Diamond. Of these, nearly 500 carats (326 samples) were gem-quality single-crystal diamonds, with the remainder consisting of bort, which was not part of this study. The 326 gem-quality rough diamonds ranged from 1.20 to 1.80 ct, and mainly included D-to-Z range (236), brown (70), yellow (3), gray (16), and pinkish (1) colors (figure 24). Several of the diamonds contained dark-colored inclusions that were assumed to be sulfides and other minerals (figure 25). Since both studies mentioned above were concerned with the inclusions in Diavik diamonds, we decided to focus our characterization on different aspects of the diamonds. Each of the 326 gem-quality diamonds was evaluated for crystal morphology, DiamondView fluorescence, and absorption spectra (FTIR and UV-Vis-NIR).
The Diavik rough diamonds examined were dominated by octahedral forms with varying amounts of resorption (figure 26). Of the 326 samples examined, 63% (206 diamonds) showed well-developed octahedral forms with little or no resorption toward the dodecahedral form. Twenty stones were very strongly resorbed to dodecahedral forms. Two showed cube forms, and 14 others appeared to be resorbed cubes that resulted in “hopper” forms. The shapes of 22 diamonds were dominated by twinning, with 17 of those being macles. Irregular forms were observed in 43 diamonds, and an additional 19 samples showed octahedral forms but had a complete or partial coating of light or dark fibrous diamond around a gem-quality interior (figure 27). Many of the rough octahedral diamonds without a coating showed strongly etched crystal surfaces, similar to those seen beneath the fibrous layer on the coated diamonds (where the coating was broken off), suggesting that a much larger proportion of Diavik rough diamonds was coated at one time.
DiamondView imaging revealed uniform blue fluorescence in about 98% of the samples, varying in intensity from very weak to strong (figure 28). Only seven diamonds showed predominantly green fluorescence, all of which had resorbed cube-form “hopper” shapes. Three samples showed isolated patches of green fluorescence from the H3 optical defect oriented along crisscrossing linear planes within the dominant blue. The coated samples showed blue fluorescence in both the gemmy interior and the fibrous coating.
Infrared absorption spectra, collected using a Thermo Nicolet 6700 spectrometer with a diffuse reflectance accessory, revealed that all of the diamonds in this study contained nitrogen impurities and were type Ia. Total nitrogen content ranged from approximately 6 ppm to more than 1000 ppm, with only eight samples containing less than 100 ppm. Nearly 98% of the samples were either pure type IaA (dominated by A-aggregate nitrogen pairs) or mixed IaAB types with various proportions of A- and B-aggregates. Only eight (less than 3%) were pure type IaB (dominated by B-aggregate nitrogen groups), suggesting that the Diavik diamonds had not spent a long enough residence time at elevated temperatures within the earth for advanced nitrogen aggregation to occur (Allen and Evans, 1981).
UV-visible absorption spectra were collected at liquid nitrogen temperature using an Ocean Optics CCD spectrometer, integrating sphere, and halogen light source to evaluate the cause of color in the Diavik diamonds. Four UV-Vis spectral features were recorded: “cape” bands at 415 and 478 nm (causing pale yellow color), “vacancy cluster” general absorption increasing to shorter wavelengths (causing brown color), “550 nm” broad band absorption associated with plastic deformation (causes brown or pink color), and broad hydrogen-related bands at approximately 720 and 840 nm (causes brownish or greenish color) (figure 29). Based on the spectra, ~58% of the rough diamonds have yellowish D-to-Z range or brighter yellow colors produced by “cape” bands with or without hydrogen features. With the exception of one pink diamond colored by a 550 nm band and 16 gray stones colored by coatings, the remaining samples were various shades of brown caused by a combination of vacancy cluster and 550 nm band absorptions. The presence of these latter absorption bands in ~37% of the samples suggests that a significant portion of the Diavik diamonds underwent plastic deformation, likely during kimberlite emplacement and eruption.
SUMMARY
Diavik is one of the world’s most modern diamond mining operations. It is the largest diamond mine in Canada, producing approximately seven million carats per year, divided between the two owners. In June 2016, Diavik surpassed 100 million carats of production (“Diavik diamond mine: 2015 sustainable development report,” 2016). Construction and operation of the mine presented considerable challenges because of Diavik’s setting in an extremely remote arctic area that can only be supplied for eight weeks a year via a temporary ice road. The kimberlite pipes are also located under lakes, requiring an elaborate system of dikes and drainage to maintain safe mining operations. While the mine is costly to run safely and sustainably, the high quality of the diamonds it produces (figure 30) will enable it to operate at a profit until its scheduled closing in 2024.

We highlight the importance of recognition and appreciation of diversity in terms of discourses, gender, indigenous and non-indigenous peoples, governance, education, economies, social realities, sustainability and balanced participation in leadership and decision making both in the public and private sectors.
Project Background
The geopolitical and global economic significance of the Arctic region has been growing fast, inter alia because of climate change as well as resource and economic development. The changes we witness in the Arctic – ecological, social and economic – affect both men and women although sometimes in different ways.
The gap between women and men with regard to economic participation and political empowerment remains wide and must continue to be addressed. Our common goal is to secure equal opportunities for men and women, to enable boys and girls to lead the lives they desire in a world without discrimination. This subject must become an integral part of Arctic policies in order to strengthen social well-being and support sustainable development in the region.
In the autumn of 2013 a proposal was submitted to the Arctic Council for a project aimed to promote a dialogue on gender equality in the Arctic region and to raise awareness of the situation of women and men in the Arctic. This would include addressing key issues such as control over resources, representation in decision-making, political participation, and material and cultural well-being.
The purpose of this project would be to promote an extensive, policy-relevant dialogue on issues of gender equality in the Arctic region in the context of current realities in terms of economic and social development as well as current and future challenges, inter alia relating to climatic and environmental changes.
The conference in 2014 also received invaluable support and expertise from members of its scoping committee, including: Dr. Gail Fondahl, University of Northern British Columbia; Assistant Professor Erika Hayfield, University of the Faroe Islands; Assistant Professor Auður H. Ingólfsdóttir, Bifröst University; Assistant Professor Anna Karlsdóttir, University of Iceland; Ph.D. student Liza Mack, Aleut International Organization; Dr. Päivi Naskali, University of Lapland; Senior Adviser Lise Östby, Norwegian Directorate for Children, Youth and Families; Director Kristinn Schram, Centre for Arctic Policy Studies of the University of Iceland. Thank you all for your valuable insights and dynamic discussions.
Phase I \\ 2013-2015
Conference and Report
Project partners in the circumpolar region joined hands to organize the international conference Gender Equality in the Arctic – Current realities, future challenges.
The conference took place in Akureyri, Iceland in October 2014 and attracted 150 scholars, NGOs, politicians, government and business representatives from all the Arctic States. Information about the conference itself, partners and sponsors, as well as recordings of all conference sessions can be found on the conference website.
The report Gender Equality in the Arctic: Current realities, future challenges (pub. 2015) builds on the comprehensive presentations and discussions that took place during the conference in Akureyri. The report contributes to advancing debate and research on gender issues and calls attention to the continued disparity between women and men with regard to economic participation and political empowerment.
Key outcome of the report are policy relevant highlights derived from the conference material:
Gender issues and equality should be a priority in the Arctic region
Women’s access to and participation in political and economic spheres in the public or private sectors must be improved.
Arctic states bear an obligation to ensure gender equality and eliminate all forms of discrimination.
Diversity within gender categories must be respected and complex gender identities taken into account.
Economic diversity and knowledge based companies will be a key to sustainable northern development in the future. Innovation and entrepreneurship are vital to community and regional development in the north.
Policy concerning climate change must include women’s and indigenous peoples’ perspectives.
Gender roles are in the process of gradual transition. Men need to be more actively engaged in the gender debate.
A greater understanding of social contexts and determinants is needed for effective suicide prevention.
Migration patterns must be taken into account in policy-making.
Achieving gender equality requires a combination of different tools, f.ex. Gender Based Analysis (GBA) and Gender mainstreaming.
State centered discourses continue to set the agenda in the Arctic. The traditional “state security” framework needs competition and critical analysis.
Diversity in educational opportunities and in the labor market must be created or maintained. Education has a gendered dimension and attitudes towards education must change.
Responses to change are diverse and context based, and require adaptive capacity from individuals as well as communities. Males and females respond and adapt differently to change.

Phase III \\ 2019-2021
Together Towards a Sustainable Arctic
We are proud to announce that Gender Equality in the Arctic has moved into its third phase (GEA III), following the handover of the Arctic Council Chairmanship from Finland to Iceland. The GEA is a Sustainable Development Working Group (SDWG) project as well as a project under the Icelandic Chairmanship Programme 2019-2021.
The Icelandic Chairmanship Program - Together Towards a Sustainable Arctic – includes four main priority areas: the Arctic Marine Environment; Climate and Green Energy Solutions; People and Communities of the Arctic; and a Stronger Arctic Council. The GEA III falls under the priority People and Communities of the Arctic which includes initiatives that aim to promote the wellbeing of the roughly four million people living in the region.
Gender equality is an important element for achieving sustainable development. Iceland will continue to lead a project that aims to promote dialogue on gender equality in the Arctic and strengthen a network of experts and stakeholders in the field.
For more information, visit People and Communities of the Arctic on the Icelandic Government’s website.
GEA III is an Arctic Council Sustainable Development Working Group (SDWG) project and a chairmanship project of the Icelandic Arctic Council Chairmanship 2019-2021, as part of the priority People and Communities of the Arctic. Project leader is Iceland with co-leadership from Sweden, Finland, Canada, the Saami Council, the Aleut International Association, and the USA.
The purpose and objective of the GEA III project is to raise visibility and understanding of the importance of gender-issues in the Arctic, to identify priorities and concrete strategies for increased diversity and gender balance in policy- and decision-making processes and to provide information to facilitate sustainable policy making for the future.
A primary component of GEAIII is a Pan-Arctic Report on Gender and Diversity in the Arctic. Read more on the Report.
Moreover, a GEA Times digital Newsletter is being published quarterly, focusing on disseminating information about the status of GEA III and highlighting gender related topics in the Arctic. Contributions from as many, and as diverse, individuals and groups as possible are encouraged to represent the various realities that people in the Arctic inhabit.
Calling for Material
An important output of the GEA project is to provide an online platform for an inventory of existing networks, projects, reports, books and articles as well as videos and events related to issues of equality in the Arctic. Visit the Published Materials page to learn more.

""A climate in crisis,"" President Biden said in his inauguration speech, is among a cascade of challenges in a ""winter of peril and possibility.""
Few places face more urgent threats from climate change than the Arctic, which is warming more than twice as fast as anywhere else on Earth. Sea ice has radically declined since the 1970s. Within a few decades, summer sea ice may disappear completely—with implications for regional weather patterns, erosion, shipping traffic and oil exploration, as well as extreme weather events and sea-level rise in the U.S. and around the world.
Rapid environmental changes add to challenges facing the Arctic's more than 4 million residents, roughly 1 in 10 of whom are part of Indigenous groups who have long relied on sea ice and marine ecosystems.
According to Stanford University scholars, the Biden administration can help to slow damage and lay groundwork for a more sustainable future for Arctic ecosystems and inhabitants. Actions they see as key include slashing carbon emissions; hitting the brakes on oil development in sensitive coastal areas; repairing relationships with other Arctic countries; improving fisheries management; and providing resources for Arctic communities to relocate from places becoming unlivable due to global warming.
""Given the speed of change in the Arctic, the sooner that environmental policies are implemented, the more effective they are likely to be,"" said Kevin Arrigo, professor of Earth system science.
Executive orders
On his first day in office, President Biden committed the country to rejoin the Paris Agreement, the 2015 international accord designed to avert catastrophic climate change. He ordered a moratorium on oil and gas leasing in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) and a review of the potential environmental impacts of the long-debated oil and gas program in the coastal refuge. He also reinstated Obama-era protections for a ""climate resilience area"" off the coast of Alaska, withdrawing certain offshore waters and the Bering Sea from oil and gas drilling.
Stanford oceanographer Rob Dunbar said he favors halting oil activity in ANWR, where the Trump administration approved leases for drilling on its last full day in office—nearly four years after Congress opened a 1.5 million-acre section of the refuge to oil development.
""We do not need the oil and gas that is in ANWR to keep our country going as we transition to green energy,"" Dunbar said. ""It is expensive and environmentally dangerous to explore for and produce hydrocarbons in the far north, and it seems nuts to do so while we are trying to develop, fund and implement the non-fossil energy systems that we need to quickly bring online.""
For animal populations in the Arctic, recent research led by Arrigo suggests climate-related stresses have a greater impact than do acute stressors such as increased shipping and subsistence harvesting. ""The biggest concern in the short term is the loss of sea ice,"" Arrigo said. Longer term, the Arctic Ocean's relatively shallow waters and the importance of shelled marine animals in its food web heighten its vulnerability to acidification, which occurs when seawater absorbs more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. ""The only policy intervention I can think of to address these issues is to reduce CO2 emissions,"" Arrigo said.
The new administration's return to the Paris Agreement and framing of climate change as an ""existential threat"" central to U.S. domestic, national security and foreign policy may aid cooperation among Arctic nations on emissions and other climate issues.
""The United States was in effect blocking much of that work for four years,"" said David Balton, a senior fellow at Stanford's Center for Ocean Solutions and a former U.S. ambassador who was in charge of Arctic policy until 2017. ""President Biden's decision to bring us back into the Paris Agreement had immediate effects on the perception of the United States among the other Arctic governments and on their willingness to deal with us.""
Resilience and adaptation
Reinstatement of the resilience area in the Bering Sea carries ""huge"" significance, Dunbar said. ""It sends a message to the Indigenous inhabitants of the region that we as a nation do care about their plight.""
By prohibiting bottom fish trawling and limiting shipping and oil and gas development, the arrangement protects a highly productive ecosystem, including iconic species such as whales and polar bears. While these protections cannot fully mitigate the effects of climate change, he said, dealing with local stressors can buy time. For example, better fisheries management can help prevent stock collapses even as warming oceans and streams cause some fish populations to decline, he said.
At the regional level, securing commitments to rein in soot pollution could have ""strong and fairly quick consequences"" for slowing Arctic warming, Balton said. When the dark particles settle onto ice and snow, reflectivity is lowered, so more of the sun's heat ends up being absorbed.
According to Balton, the central Arctic Ocean notably lacks an international marine science organization of the sort that has helped to spur science efforts in the North Atlantic and North Pacific regions. ""That might be a good first step to build confidence and strengthen international institutions for the region,"" he said.
Kristen Green, a Stanford Ph.D. student whose research focuses on sustainable marine resource planning for Alaskan Arctic communities, hopes to see the Biden administration bring new urgency to climate adaptation. ""This issue will affect every aspect of Arctic decision-making, from an international to village scale,"" she said.
The Coastal Climate Resilience program, proposed by President Obama but never enacted, offers a promising model, Green said. The program would have provided funding to relocate entire Alaska Native villages threatened by the effects of climate change, and offered resources for at-risk coastal states, local governments and their communities to prepare for and adapt to climate change.
""There are huge economic costs to a warming Arctic Alaska,"" she said. These are not distant threats: ""The wild foods that Alaska Natives have relied on since time immemorial are becoming harder to access,"" she said. And already, thawing of the permafrost that underlies homes, pipelines, railroads, military bases and other infrastructure throughout much of the Arctic has caused cracks, buckles and spills. According to Green, ""The rest of the world will be looking to Arctic communities for lessons in adaptation and resilience in the face of climate change, and the United States can be a leader here.""",User comments,Josie Garthwaite,,Science|Physics News|Science news|Technology News|Physics|Materials|Nanotech|Technology|Science,2021-03-24,Phys.org

Resilience means the capacity of communities and systems to recover and restore themselves from various kinds of crises and disturbances. The Arctic region is changing rapidly, and the speed of ongoing change makes adaptation extremely challenging. Governments, indigenous peoples, local communities, researchers, and businesses must work together to build resilience to the social-ecological changes that are underway.
In May, 2017, the Foreign Ministers of the Arctic Council adopted the Arctic Resilience Action Framework(ARAF) to organize regional resilience actions.The ARAF provides the Council with a common frame for building and supporting resilience in the Arctic region.
Arctic leaders encouraged the Arctic Council to host a Forum every two years to take stock of Arctic Resilience and foster implementation and investments that enhance resilience and climate adaptation actions in the region.
The first Arctic Resilience Forum, hosted by the Finnish Chairmanship and supported by the Arctic Council Secretariat, was held in Rovaniemi, Finland in September of 2018. Convening over 100 Arctic leaders, the first Forum helped build a broader understanding of the importance of resilience, particularly for northern communities, and how to implement and gain financial support for resilience actions in the region. Participants expressed eagerness to convene once again, in two years, to engage more directly in resilience progress, accelerate resilience actions, and build out the Arctic resilience community of practice.
The Corona-Virus pandemic reinforces the importance of understanding and supporting resilience in the Arctic. The longer-term impacts of the pandemic for the Arctic and the globe remain uncertain; however, the experiences of Arctic communities over the last several months highlight the Arctic’s unique circumstances. Furthermore, the pandemic highlights the unique strengths and vulnerabilities and reinforces the case for a holistic approach to understanding and building resilience.
In this context, the Icelandic Chairmanship will host the Arctic Council’s second biannual Arctic Resilience Forum.The ARF seeks to actively engage participants in conversations about how to build the resilience of Arctic communities and ecosystems. It offers the opportunity to discuss concrete best practices and experiences from the Council and the broader community of circumpolar experts and knowledge holders. The Arctic Resilience Forum aims to continue to strengthen cooperation on resilience work.

In this window of time, some of these open-water areas come to life with phytoplankton blooms so large and vivid they can be seen from space.
The summer of 2020 has been one of those summers. Phytoplankton—the floating plant-like organisms that, like plants on land, need sunlight and nutrients to thrive—have exploded in numbers, or “bloomed,” across ice-free northern latitudes. The image above, acquired on July 26 with the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on NASA’s Terra and Aqua satellites, shows a bloom of phytoplankton in the Barents Sea, north of Scandinavia and Russia.
In the Barents Sea, blooms that show up in spring and early summer are typically composed of diatoms—a microscopic form of algae with silica shells and ample chlorophyll, which makes them appear green in satellite images. By late July and into autumn, waters become warmer and more stratified. This change promotes blooms of coccolithopohres, a type of phytoplankton that turns the water milky white-green in satellite imagery due to their calcium carbonate shells. Sometimes, as is likely the case here, both types of phytoplankton show up to at once.
While blooms around the Arctic are somewhat common, new research has shown that phytoplankton biomass is continuing to increase in the Arctic Ocean. In a recent paper published in Science, researchers from Stanford University found that the rate of growth of phytoplankton biomass across the Arctic Ocean increased by 57 percent between 1998 and 2018.
The success of phytoplankton in this increasingly ice-free environment is apparent in the map above. It shows changes in the amount of chlorophyll a—the pigment used by phytoplankton to harness sunlight for making food—during the past two decades across the Arctic Ocean. The map was produced using a regional algorithm that incorporates satellite data from NASA’s SeaWiFS and MODIS instruments. Notice that most of the increase is in the Chukchi and Barents seas.
“We were certainly surprised to see that phytoplankton biomass has begun to increase in the Arctic,” said Stanford biological oceanographer Kevin Arrigo, whose doctoral student Kate Lewis led the study. “Many people have been saying that with increased melt, nutrient inventories would decline, but that is not what we saw.”
Between 1998 and 2008, the increase in phytoplankton biomass was likely the result of increasingly vast expanses of ice-free waters and a longer growing season. Since 2009, the increases have been due to phytoplankton growing in ever-higher concentrations. The implication is that nutrients might be increasing in some parts of the Arctic Ocean.
Not all areas saw increases; the waters east of Greenland stand out. Arrigo speculated that the decline there could be related to higher nutrient consumption “upstream” in waters that have become more productive. “But we would have to go there and look to know for sure,” he said.
It remains unclear how phytoplankton biomass will change in the future as Arctic sea ice cover continues to shrink. “The Arctic Ocean is changing in an alarming rate and soon may lose a lot of its uniquely polar characteristics,” Arrigo said. “There will always be winter ice, but for the rest of the year, it’s starting to look a lot like our temperate oceans.”

CAFF's mandate is to address the conservation of Arctic biodiversity, and to communicate its findings to the governments and residents of the Arctic, helping to promote practices which ensure the sustainability of the Arctic's living resources. It does so through various monitoring, assessment and expert group activities.","Globally, invasive non-native species are considered the second most important threat to biodiversity after habitat loss. These are species introduced by human activity that flourish and spread in their new environment and threaten native species and ecosystem functions.
The Arctic Invasive Alien Species (ARIAS) Strategy and Action Plan, produced by CAFF and the Protection of the Arctic Marine Environment (PAME) sets forth the priority actions that the Arctic Council and its partners are encouraged to take to protect the Arctic region from a significant threat: the adverse impacts of invasive alien species. These priority actions span terrestrial, aquatic, and marine ecosystems. The actions take environmental, cultural, and economic perspectives into consideration, including drivers, impacts, and response measures.
The priority actions are divided into three categories:
Inspire urgent and effective action
Goal: Raise awareness of the unique opportunity that the Arctic Council and its partners have to inspire the urgent and effective action necessary to protect the Arctic from invasive alien species.
Improve the knowledge base for well-informed decision making
Goal: Improve the capacity of the Arctic Council and its partners to make well-informed decisions on the needs, priorities, and options for preventing, eradicating, and controlling invasive alien species in the Arctic by improving the knowledge base.
Undertake prevention and early detection/rapid response initiatives
Goal: Protect Arctic ecosystems and human well-being by instituting prevention and early detection/rapid response programs for invasive alien species as a matter of priority.
All those who value the Arctic are invited to consider the relevance of these priorities to their goals and to take action, as appropriate. Achieving these goals is dependent upon cooperation and urgent action. Some of the actions identified apply to the Arctic Council as a whole, while others are best addressed at the working group level or through national implementation. It is recommended that Arctic States, Permanent Participants, and their partners integrate the ARIAS Strategy and Action Plan into national commitments, as appropriate, and employ these priority actions as a means to advance decisions under other multi-lateral fora and instruments. These priority actions provide guidance on where to start, where to place priorities, and where to invest in the future of the Arctic.
This effort is particularly urgent for the Arctic region. Rapid climate change is making the region more vulnerable to invasive species introductions, and at the same time a rapid increase in human activity and transit and energy development in the region is increasing the chance of introduction of new and invasive species. There is an immediate opportunity, already largely lost in many other regions of the world, to proactively build resilience to the risks posed by invasive species to the Arctic's unique social, economic, and environmental systems.
The Arctic Biodiveristy Assessment Key Finding #6 states that
There are currently few invasive alien species in the Arctic, but more are expected with climate change and increased human activity
The Arctic Biodiveristy Assessment Recommendation #9 states that there is a need to:
Reduce the threat of invasive alien/non-native species to the Arctic by developing and implementing common measures for early detection and reporting, identifying and blocking pathways of introduction, and sharing best practices and techniques for monitoring, eradication and control. This includes supporting international efforts currently underway, for example those of the International Maritime Organization to effectively treat ballast water to clean and treat ship hulls and drilling rigs.
CAFF's Actions for Arctic Biodiversity: Implementing the Actions of the Arctic Biodiversity Assessment 2013-2021 outlines two projects to address Arctic invasive Species:
- 9.1 (2015-2017): Develop a strategy for the prevention and management of invasive species across the Arctic, including the identification and mitigation of pathways of introduction of invasions. Include involvement of indigenous observing networks, which include invasive and new species reporting, to assist with early detection.
- 9.2 (2017-2019): Incorporate common protocols for early detection and reporting of non-native invasive species in the Arctic into Circumpolar Biodiversity Monitoring Program (CBMP) monitoring plans.
Questions to be addressed in the Arctic Invasive Species Strategy
- How and where are living organisms likely to be introduced to Arctic ecosystems?Using existing information and expert knowledge identify trends in risks associated with human activities and rank the pathways by which alien species are likely to be introduced into the Arctic, and produce maps of the geographic locations where each pathway is likely to deliver organisms. Proxies of the likelihood of invasion, such as human density, human economic activity or shipping traffic might be used. Ranks might be based on the number of species transported and the frequency with which introductions might occur. All pathways would be considered, including transportation-related pathways (e.g., ships, ice-breakers, fishing vessels, drilling platforms, trucks, planes) and commerce in living organisms (e.g., agricultural, aquaculture, ornamental plants and animals, pet trade).
- Which species are both likely to be introduced and likely to be harmful?Use a literature review and other existing knowledge to create lists, identify trends and map alien species currently established in the Arctic, and any knowledge about invasive species impacts.Trends in the extinction risks of native species impacted by invasive speciesUse existing global knowledge (e.g., about biogeographic regions, climate, environmental conditions) to create a map of the world indicating regions that might harbour species that could thrive if introduced into the Arctic.Use consensus building (e.g., horizon scanning) and/or statistical methods to develop risk assessment tools to distinguish species that are likely to be harmful (in terms of ecological, economic and health impact) from those unlikely to cause harm. Such tools could then be used by multiple Arctic Council members, helping to harmonize risk assessment outcomes across jurisdictions and therefore allow jurisdictions to avoid harm from a species that might otherwise be allowed into one jurisdiction and then spread easily to other jurisdictions in this region of shared ecosystems.
- Which high value locations (areas protected for biodiversity value, indigenous hunting and fishing areas, important caribou/reindeer habitat, etc.) are especially vulnerable to invasion?Use existing data (e.g. from ABA) and expert knowledge to map areas that are of high value (including for biodiversity) to enable more informed prioritization of prevention and management measures.Use a literature review, expert knowledge and where possible existing data, to make recommendations on best practices and techniques for early detection and monitoring (including synergies with CBMP), as well as eradication and control efforts for highly vulnerable areas for reporting for the member states.
- How can the different layers of information gathered to answer the questions above be integrated to identify locations and practices that are most likely to prevent future harm from invasions?Create a spatially explicit risk atlas of the Arctic by using expert knowledge and output from the efforts described above to elicit scores for ecological, economic and health risk (considering the probability of invasion and the probability of impact given invasion). The value of the resource should also be assessed in conjunction with each risk.Recommend codes of pathway practices to block invasions from prioritized pathways into prioritized areas of terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecosystems.Integrate risk atlas results and information on high-risk species and pathways to inform monitoring and other management activities (e.g., Hazard Analysis & Critical Control Points (HACCP)) that can contribute to early detection and rapid response activities.Liaise with other multi-lateral efforts developing similar broad initiatives to prevent the spread and establishment of invasive species into a region of the globe to share experiences, ideas and lessons-learned, and develop a system for collating and sharing information to meet future monitoring and management needs.
- What management activities and polices have been adopted to improve management of invasions?Identify and share trends in international and national efforts to address the impacts and risks of invasive species.",,Courtney Price,,conservation|arctic|biodiversity|biological diversity|flora|fauna|wildlife|animals|CAFF|Conservation of Arctic Flora and Fauna|Arctic Council|northern|science|monitoring|assessment|reporting|data|policy|CBMP|Circumpolar Biodiversity Monitoring Programme|Circumpolar Biodiversity Monitoring Program|sustainable use|arctic resources|strategy|press|media|ABA|Arctic Biodiversity Assessment|government|intergovernmental organization|IGO|living resources|polar|north,,Arctic Invasive Alien Species

Representatives of the eight Arctic States and six Arctic Indigenous groups will attend in person. Everyone else will be able to attend virtually.
“Iceland is preparing for minimum in-person attendance and an extensive virtual platform that will allow a broad audience to participate remotely,” the forum said in a news release on Thursday after the final Senior Arctic Official’s plenary meeting in Reykjavik.
Foreign minister praises forum’s ability to adapt
The Arctic Council is an international forum that focuses on environmental protection and sustainable development in the North. The chairmanship rotates through the eight Arctic states every two years.
The biennial ministerial meeting is where the leadership is officially handed over, and when updates are given on projects from the forum’s six working groups. The working groups are made up of experts from around the world and examine issues ranging Arctic contaminants to emergency response in the Arctic.
In May, current chair Iceland will hand the Arctic gavel over to Russia.
Iceland’s four chairmanship priorities were the Arctic marine environment, climate and green energy solutions, people and communities of the Arctic, and a stronger Arctic Council. And although COVID-19 challenged the forum’s work, Iceland said it’s proud of what it accomplished.

“Covid-19 has affected our Chairmanship, but despite some delays in projects and postponed events and meetings, we were able to adapt quickly,” Iceland’s Foreign Minister Gudlaugur Thor Thordarson said.
“We have carried out most of our plans, including a virtual version of the Plastics Symposium and we launched an online format of the Council’s new marine cooperation initiative. The collaborative efforts demonstrate that the Arctic Council is adaptable, solutions-oriented and open minded when faced with a crisis.”
The upcoming ministerial will take place on May 20 in Reykjavik.

Through outreach activities and with competent and committed partners on arctic issues, Arctic Frontiers sets the agenda, linking policy, business and science for responsible and sustainable development of the Arctic. The main premise behind Arctic Frontiers is to couple academia with decision makers from government and business. The Arctic Frontiers partnership network consists of some of the world’s leading actors in the Arctic. The competence and interdisciplinarity of the partner network is unique in both national and international contexts.
The Arctic’s role is changing. From being a cold periphery, the region is increasingly playing a role at the centre on the geopolitical stage. With vast energy and marine resources, the region is on the agenda of industrial, political and societal organisations across the globe. Increased human activity in the Arctic will have significant economic, political, and social implications for Arctic nations and will influence the Arctic environment. Arctic Frontiers discusses the political frameworks needed to utilise these opportunities in a responsible way.
Arctic Frontiers 2021
Arctic Frontiers started out in 2006 assembling the first global scientific conference on economic, societal and environmental sustainable growth in the north. In February 2021, we will arrange the 15th conference with the theme “Building Bridges”. The conference has a pan arctic perspective and builds new partnerships across nations, generations and ethnic groups. Arctic Frontiers provides a forum for dialogue and communication between science, government and industry in the Arctic.
Year round activities
In between the annual conferences, the Arctic Frontiers secretariat works together with the partners with all the five pillars that Arctic Frontiers is founded upon; Policy, Business, Science, Arena and Young. Through seminars, open debates, workshops, projects and network meetings both in Norway and abroad, Arctic Frontiers sets the agenda and advocates a responsible knowledge-based growth and development in the Arctic.

Though the boats, rigs and other trappings of human activity have already quickly moved into this fragile environment, scientists are only just beginning to understand how the light, sound and chemical pollution they bring with them is impacting the Arctic’s marine ecosystem.
Some researchers have started filling in the gaps, including two teams working in Norway that presented new findings about the behaviors of zooplankton and killer and humpback whales at the Arctic Frontiers 2020 conference in the nation’s city of Tromsø in January. Though zooplankton may seem to have little in common with whales, research shows that creatures at both extremes of the Arctic food web are critical to the health of the marine ecosystem. Understanding how industry affects these animals could help inform policies governing commercial activities in the Arctic.
Light Sensitivity
Tiny zooplankton move in response to light cues during the day. When the sun rises in the morning, they drift down closer to the seabed to avoid predators. When the sun sets, they ascend toward the surface to feed. During the 24 hours of darkness occurring in the Arctic winter—a nearly month-long period called the polar night—scientists had thought zooplankton simply stopped moving under the sea ice, says Jørgen Berge, a taxonomist and marine biologist at UiT–the Arctic University of Norway.
But that thinking changed after the winter of 2007–2008, when Berge noticed that zooplankton in the fjords of the Svalbard archipelago were still moving up and down in patterns similar to the ones they followed when the sun shone. He found they could still sense and respond to low levels of light from the moon, the aurora borealis and background illumination from the sun—even under thick layers of ice and snow. “It was a complete surprise to us,” Berge says.
In subsequent work, he showed that other Arctic denizens, such as shrimp, krill, herring and cod, would also respond to light levels that were orders of magnitude lower than the ones similar species experience in waters elsewhere around the world. This left him concerned that Arctic animals would be extra sensitive to artificial light and that exposure to it could change important aspects of their behavior. Such light pollution, which shines with an intensity and composition not found in nature, has been shown to disrupt the hormone production and metabolism of many vertebrate species, including fish—and humans.
To investigate, Berge monitored how Arctic animals moved in response to the artificial lights from just one ship: his own research vessel. In three locations during the polar night of 2019, Berge measured the total mass of the marine animals around the ship with the lights on and off. In each case, there was a significant difference. At one location, there were about half as many animals around the ship when the lights were switched on. In another, with a different animal population, the biomass increased with the lights on—a response Berge says is not surprising, because, like moths on land, some marine animals have adapted to be attracted to light instead of repelled by it.
This research, published Thursday in Communications Biology, has strong implications for the fishing industry, Berge says. Norwegian authorities currently gather information about the abundance of fish in the area throughout the year, including during the polar night, and use that information to determine fishing limits. But because these assessments are carried out with artificial lights on, “that could have a strong bias,” Berge notes. “Our ability to measure and understand and make good predictions as to how much you can fish could be based on wrong input data.”
Likewise Berge believes that no scientific study that has ever been conducted during the polar night—with lights turned on—could be considered an unbiased representation of how the animals would naturally behave during that time. “In darkness and light, you will get two very different results, and the knowledge about the system will be very different,” Berge says. Franz Hölker, an ecologist at the Leibniz Institute of Freshwater Ecology and Inland Fisheries in Germany, who studies light pollution but was not involved with the new work, agrees. He says Berge’s findings mirror some of his own.
Safety concerns for humans make it impractical to ban artificial light in the Arctic altogether, Berge says. “Rather we need to understand what effects light pollution is causing.” That way, the level of bias in scientific studies and fishery estimates could be quantified and, to some degree, corrected.
Where the Whales Are
The need for more knowledge of human industry’s effects exists on the other end of the Arctic animal size scale as well. Though fishing, shipping, and oil and gas activities have expanded rapidly in the Arctic, “we have no idea what the whales are doing,” says Evert Mul, a Ph.D. student at UiT. “We plan those activities without taking into account the presence and the distribution and the behavior of the whales.”
To help change that situation, Mul and his colleagues at UiT and the Institute of Marine Research in Norway have tagged 45 killer whales and 30 humpback whales over the past seven years—many more than in previous tagging studies. Doing so allowed them to map how these whales interact with the human activities taking place in polar regions for what they say is the first time ever in this part of the Arctic.
Mul says the team’s results, which he expects to publish this summer, show the whales spent significant amounts of time in the locations where there was heavy shipping traffic, as well as oil and gas installations. “And of course, they spend a lot of time near fishing vessels,” because they are drawn to the massive amounts of fish the commercial boats collect, he says. It is not uncommon to see anywhere from 50 to 100 whales around a single vessel, Mul adds. Attracted to such a concentration of these spectacular animals, boats filled with tourists join the action, too.
Greg Breed, a biologist and associate professor at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, who was not involved with Mul’s work, has observed similar confluences in human and whale activity during his own studies in the Canadian Arctic. “They happen to overlap because they’re using the same space,” he says. For example, whales take advantage of the ice-free passages cleared by large vessels.
Though the whales may seem to benefit from easy snacks swiped while swimming near fishing boats, human activity may harm the animals, too. Many of the cetaceans tagged in Mul’s study have visible scars from entanglement with fishing nets or collisions with boat hulls or propellers. Noise pollution can interfere with the complex songs the creatures use to communicate, he says. Chemical pollution is another issue. Killer whales already have some of the highest contamination from polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) on earth, and modeling has demonstrated this problem could endanger the long-term survival of the Arctic killer whale population.
As Breed points out, though, it is also possible that stressors other than physical injuries or pollutants—such as interruptions to the marine food chain linked to warming ocean waters—could be having more of an impact on Arctic whale populations. Potential impacts, including those identified by Mul and Berge, should be considered when making decisions about industry in the Arctic, the researchers say. Like Berge, Mul believes the best course of action at this point is not to call for drastic bans but for policies that make obvious sense—such as better regulation of pollutants where whales are more abundant. Mul also stresses the need to continue improving the information scientists have about the magnitude of the problem.
Even with limited knowledge, those who are planning industrial activities in the Arctic still need to be aware of the possibility that their presence could have repercussions, Mul says. He would like industries to at least “have the seasonal whale distribution in the back of their mind, even while we are still continuing to understand, and to map, the situation.” To help with this effort, Mul plans to hold a meeting with Norwegian industry leaders to inform them of his results and seek feedback about how he can present the information in a way that is useful to them. “It's very important,” he says, “to have at least a basic understanding of what the animals are doing that we are going to share this region with.”",,Chiara Eisner,,,2020-03-05,Scientific American

The extreme Arctic climate makes the region a forbidding place to travel and a challenging place to live. Even so, people have found ways to explore and live in the Arctic. Indigenous peoples have lived in the Arctic for thousands of years. Explorers, adventurers, and researchers have also ventured into the Arctic to explore its unique environment and geography.
In the winter, cold Arctic temperatures and extreme wind chills make it dangerous to venture outdoors without proper clothing and gear. Strong storms can make travel difficult. And heating a home can be challenging and expensive without trees to cut for firewood. However, people have found ways to adapt, survive, and thrive in the Arctic.
Indigenous People

Residents of the Arctic include a number of indigenous groups as well as more recent arrivals from more southern latitudes. In total, only about 4 million people live in the Arctic worldwide, and in most countries indigenous people make up a minority of the Arctic population.
Archaeologists and anthropologists now believe that people have lived in the Arctic for as much as twenty thousand years. The Inuit in Canada and Greenland, and the Yu'pik, Iñupiat, and Athabascan in Alaska, are just a few of the groups that are native to the Arctic. Traditionally, Arctic native peoples lived primarily from hunting, fishing, herding, and gathering wild plants for food, although some people also practice farming, particularly in Greenland. Northern people found many different ways to adapt to the harsh Arctic climate, developing warm dwellings and clothing to protect them from frigid weather. They also learned how to predict the weather and navigate in boats and on sea ice. Many Arctic people now live much like their neighbors to the south, with modern homes and appliances. Nonetheless, there is an active movement among indigenous people in the Arctic to pass on traditional knowledge and skills, such as hunting, fishing, herding, and native languages, to the younger generation.
Arctic Exploration

Compared to indigenous people who have lived in the Arctic for thousands of years, European explorers are relative newcomers. Europeans started venturing north into Arctic regions of Scandinavia and Russia only around a thousand years ago, with much exploration taking place in the 18th and 19th centuries.
Vikings from Scandinavia traveled to Greenland around A.D. 930, during an unusually mild period throughout most of the Northern Hemisphere. They settled for a time along the south and southwest coasts, the only habitable part of Greenland. For nearly five centuries the Norse settlements persevered, depending on their cattle, sheep and goats, as well as on seal and caribou hunts.
Contacts between the Norse settlements and the outside world ceased in the late 1400s. We now know that as the weather got steadily colder and the pasture and farming lands shrank under the advancing ice and snow, the inhabitants suffered a painful annihilation. The rapid cooling that signaled the beginning of the Little Ice Age in the early 1300s caused sea ice to expand over the North Atlantic, which made it impossible to navigate between Greenland and Iceland, trapping people in their settlements and halting trade.
Russians began exploring the northern regions of their country in the 11th and 12th centuries, and by the 17th century they had explored many Arctic islands. During the 1800's, many explorers searched for a Northwest Passage. Irish explorer, Sir Robert McClure, is credited with finding it in 1851. The first reported person to reach the North Pole is American explorer, Robert Edwin Peary. He accomplished this in 1909, however there are some doubts as to whether he actually made it or not.
People in the Modern Arctic
Many people in the Arctic today live in modern towns and cities, much like their neighbors to the south. People also work in the Arctic, extracting oil and gas from rich deposits beneath the permafrost, working in tourism, or conducting research. Other people in the arctic still live in small villages much the way their ancestors did.
Arctic people today face many changes to their homes and environment. Climate change is causing sea ice to melt and permafrost to thaw, threatening coastal villages with bigger storms and erosion. And the declining sea ice means that the Arctic Ocean could open up for commercial shipping or tourist cruises.

In winter, frozen seawater covers almost the entire Arctic Ocean and neighboring seas. This sea ice undergoes seasonal patterns of change – thinning and shrinking during late spring and summer, and thickening and expanding during fall and winter. The extent of summer sea ice in the Arctic can impact local ecosystems, regional and global weather patterns, and ocean circulation. In the last two decades, the minimum extent of Arctic sea ice in the summer has dropped markedly. The lowest extent on record was set in 2012, and last year’s extent was tied for second – until this year’s.
A Siberian heat wave in spring 2020 began this year’s Arctic sea ice melt season early, and with Arctic temperatures being 14 to 18 degrees Fahrenheit (8 to 10 degrees Celsius) warmer than average, the ice extent kept declining. The 2020 minimum extent was 958,000 square miles (2.48 million square kilometers) below the 1981-2010 average of yearly minimum extents, and 2020 is only the second time on record that the minimum extent has fallen below 1.5 million square miles (4 million square kilometers).

“It was just really warm in the Arctic this year, and the melt seasons have been starting earlier and earlier,” said Nathan Kurtz, a sea ice scientist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. “The earlier the melt season starts, the more ice you generally lose.”
Thin ice also melts quicker than thicker floes. Dramatic drops in sea ice extent in 2007 and 2012, along with generally declining summer extent, has led to fewer regions of thick, multi-year ice that has built up over multiple winters. In addition, a recent study showed that warmer water from the Atlantic Ocean, which is typically deep below the colder Arctic waters, is creeping up closer to the bottom of the sea ice and warming it from below.
There are cascading effects in the Arctic, said Mark Serreze, director of NSIDC. Warmer ocean temperatures eat away at the thicker multiyear ice, and also result in thinner ice to start the spring melt season. Melt early in the season results in more open water, which absorbs heat from the Sun and increases water temperatures.
“As the sea ice cover extent declines, what we’re seeing is we’re continuing to lose that multiyear ice,” Serreze said. “The ice is shrinking in the summer, but it’s also getting thinner. You’re losing extent, and you’re losing the thick ice as well. It’s a double whammy.”
The second lowest extent of sea ice on record is just one of many signs of a warming climate in the north, he said, pointing to the Siberian heat waves, forest fires, hotter-than-average temperatures over the Central Arctic, and the thawing permafrost that led to a Russian fuel spill.

Understanding the science of climate change, helping to develop strategies to mitigate and adapt to climate change, and safeguarding the Arctic environment are part of the EU’s wider efforts in relation to the Arctic.
The EU is committed to contributing to sustainable development in a balanced and integrated manner.
The EU engages in multilateral, regional and sub-regional cooperation on Arctic matters. Many Arctic matters relate to the Arctic as well as to lower latitudes.

EDU-ARCTIC focusses on using Arctic research as a vehicle to strengthen science education curricula all across Europe. It aims to encourage students aged 13 to 20 to pursue further education in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), setting them on a path to perhaps one day work in one of these sectors.
The project will focus on developing, comparing and evaluating the effectiveness and environmental effects of different oil spill response methods in a cold climate. In addition to this we will be developing a system for the real-time observation of underwater oil spills and a strategic tool for choosing oil spill response methods.
EU-PolarNet is the world’s largest consortium of expertise and infrastructure for polar research. From 2015-2020, EU-PolarNet will develop and deliver a strategic framework and mechanisms to prioritise science, optimise the use of polar infrastructure, and broker new partnerships that will lead to the co-design of polar research projects that deliver tangible benefits for society.
The International Network for Terrestrial Research and Monitoring in the Arctic (INTERACT) aims to build capacity for identifying, understanding, predicting and responding to diverse environmental changes throughout the wide environmental and land-use envelopes of the Arctic. This is necessary because the Arctic is so vast and so sparsely populated that environmental observing capacity is limited compared to most other latitudes.
ICE-ARC will look into the current and future changes in Arctic sea ice – both from changing atmospheric and oceanic conditions. The project will also investigate the consequences of these changes both on the economics of the area and globally, and social aspects such as on indigenous peoples.
Building Bridges is the title of this year’s Arctic Frontiers Conference, a recognition of the strength that is gained by safeguarding the Arctic as a region of peace and a global example of cooperation in an age of growing tensions and worldwide uncertainty. Arctic Frontiers 2021 brings together decision makers, indigenous leaders, business and youth representatives to discuss the most pressing issues facing the Arctic. EU High Representative Josep Borrell participated in the second day of the conference that focused on 'Building the Future'. Virginijus Sinkevičius, Commissioner for Environment, Oceans and Fisheries, participated on day four in a panel on the circular economy.
The European Union is committed to working with our international partners to make sure that the Arctic remains a stable, safe, peaceful and prosperous place.
“We believe that a safe, stable, sustainable, peaceful and prosperous Arctic is important not just for the Arctic itself, but also for the European Union and actually the whole world,” says Borrell. “The EU is in the Arctic and we have both strategic and day-to-day interests in Arctic matters.”
EU Envoy for the Arctic, Michael Mann, echoes the High Representative's words, adding that ""We have three Member States, the Kingdom of Denmark, Sweden and Finland that are Arctic states. We are consumers of a great number of products that come from the Arctic. Fish, oil, gas... And in the future, particularly for the green transition, a number of minerals found in the Arctic will also be important.""
The Arctic is a key example of why we need multilateral cooperation, as many issues affecting the Arctic regions can be more effectively addressed through regional or multilateral cooperation.
“Many of these issues are of fundamental relevance for geopolitical dynamics, for wider security concerns and for climate change – which regardless of the current pandemic remains probably the biggest global challenge that humanity is facing,” said Borrell.
There is a lot of attention on hard security issues and on great power competition for resources. Most tensions in the Arctic are, however, believed to be primarily linked to global geopolitical positioning. Arctic safety and security issues are relevant, but must be seen in a broader context.
Climate change is clearly the biggest threat the Arctic is facing. With the European Green Deal, the EU is pushing hard to reform its internal policies and to reach effective multilateral agreements to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. ""But the EU accounts for only 7% of global emissions and we want to work with all our partners around the world, and not least the Arctic States, to reach the aims of the Paris Agreement,"" explains the EU High Representative.
""What better illustration is there of the need for the Green Deal than what is happening in the Arctic?"", said Michael Mann.
Those living in the Arctic regions, in particular the indigenous peoples and the younger generation, know best why this is relevant and how important and difficult it is to balance these aims with the retention of jobs and benefits from economic activity in their regions.
The EU High Representative Josep Borrell concludes his intervention by recalling that the European Union is updating its Arctic policy this year, focusing on three key aims:
In this video message Michael Mann explains further why the Artic matters to the EU and to the world, and also speaks about his role as the EU's Arctic Ambassador. Learn more about the Arctic in his recent interview with Geopolitique.eu
Arcticness is a natural part of everyday life in Lapland. The people living in Lapland have adapted themselves and their activities to their environment and surrounding nature with a goal of becoming high level experts in Finland and in the EU on sustainable development of the northernmost regions. Smart and arctic knowledge, sustainable utilisation of natural resources and strong communities are the evolving competitive advantages of Lapland. Lapland is a melting pot of industries and it is one of Finland’s fastest growing regions with its backbones in forestry, mining, metallurgy and tourism.
“Lapland’s Arctic Smartness concept gives a shining example of how regions may successfully enhance their development activities and utilisation of EU resources. Dedication, cooperation across different sectors and strong common vision are the key ingredients,” said Kari Aalto, Director, East and North Finland EU Office. Read more
Using their traditional knowledge a reindeer herding community in Sweden mapped a 350km long reindeer movement route from the coast of Bay of Bothnia to Scandinavian mountains on the Norwegian-Swedish border. They provided the necessary basis for the planning of the North Bothnia train line and negotiated the construction of ecoducts (reindeer over-passes) on the E4 highway, which crosses this natural reindeer route. The Swedish Traffic Association also trained its staff in reindeer herding issues. Read more
On 19 August 2020, the world’s largest and longest polar research expedition – known as MOSAiC (Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate) – reached the North Pole. In September 2019, the German research icebreaker set sail from Tromsø, Norway, to spend a year drifting through the Arctic Ocean – trapped in ice. After leaving the ice floe it had been sitting in for the previous ten months, the icebreaker travelled through the Fram Strait and along the northeast coast of Greenland – a region that is usually home to thick, multi-year ice. Using radar satellite imagery and sea-ice data, researchers on board the vessel determined that the ice conditions this year were ‘lighter than usual’ and were able to complete their journey to the North Pole in just six days.
“Even though the conditions on the ice have been quite challenging due to the unusual weather conditions faced this year, first results have already revealed that warming events and associated changes of the snow surface can lead to an underestimation of the ice concentration – a major variable when studying the Arctic conditions,” explained Tânia Casal, Scientific Campaign Coordinator for the MOSAiC.

Artic-based W-Power started in 2018 to overcome the challenges of remoteness and rurality faced by women entrepreneurs in sparsely populated areas, including Arctic and peri-Arctic areas such as Lapland, North Karelia, Northern Sweden, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Ireland, encouraging these women to set-up, develop and grow their businesses. But COVID-19 demanded a rethink of the project’s approach to face new challenges.
Rachel MacNeill of Islay Whisky Academy, has had to halt her bespoke face-to-face whisky experiences on Islay. She has branched out instead into a new online whisky course (WHISKY AFFINITY ©) “The W-Power network has been a lifeline, before and since the COVID lockdown. It has helped me develop my approach to social media and online marketing. I do it all from home and it works around me,” Rachel said. Read more
The EU’s current Arctic policy, set out in a Joint Communication from 2016, is based on three pillars: fighting climate change and protecting the environment, promoting sustainable development and strengthening international cooperation.
In July 2020, the European Commission and the European External Action Service (EEAS) launched a public consultation with a view to updating its policy. Closed on 10 November 2020, the consultation helped to reflect more broadly on the new challenges and opportunities in the Arctic region, in light of the EU’s objectives under the European Green Deal and the EU’s International Ocean Governance agenda.
The consultation process involved a wide range of Arctic stakeholders, public and private alike, governmental and non-governmental, regional and local.
The overwhelming majority of responses to the consultation confirmed the continued relevance of the current Arctic priorities. What is clear from the consultation is that the EU has an important role to play in making the Arctic safe, stable, sustainable and prosperous, including through enhanced international cooperation. According to contributors the EU should
Against this background, the European Commission and the EEAS will re-examine the role of the EU in Arctic affairs and update the 2016 Joint Communication on an integrated European Union policy for the Arctic by the end of 2021.

Summary of the results of the public consultation on the EU Arctic policy
Climate change and environmental degradation are an existential threat to Europe and the world. Global climate action still falls short of what is required to achieve the long-term goals of the Paris Agreement and 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
Worldwide, greenhouse gas emission reductions have been recorded due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, but this has not been enough to be considered sustainable.
The European Green Deal sets ambitious goals aiming to transform the EU into a climate-neutral, fair and prosperous society, with a modern, resource-efficient and competitive economy. However, since the EU accounts for an 8%, and decreasing, share of global emissions, ambitious internal policy will not be enough. The Council calls for urgent, collective and decisive global action to hold the increase in the global average temperature to the Paris Agreement mitigation goal.
The Paris Agreement provides the indispensable multilateral framework governing global climate action. The EU welcomes the pledges made at the recent Climate Ambition Summit 2020 organised by the United Nations, France and the UK, in partnership with Italy and Chile, and calls on all countries to develop ambitious and detailed short and medium-term pathways, targets and policies that align with their long-term goals as a way of providing clear signals to citizens, political actors and businesses.
The EU urges all countries to also align their trade promotion, finance, aid and foreign investment strategies with their domestic climate pledges and Paris Agreement commitments, and to institute sustainable and climate sensitive economic recovery policies from the COVID-19 crisis.
The EU will work, as a matter of priority, with non-EU G20 and other major economies on climate change mitigation efforts. It stresses the need for ratification of the Paris Agreement by all who have not yet done so, and welcomes the declared intention of the new US Administration to re-join the Paris Agreement and looks forward to revitalising the EU-US Energy Council with an increased focus on energy transition and climate action.
The Council recognises that climate change and environmental degradation, including biodiversity and forest loss, are a threat to international stability and security, reinforcing disaster risks and pressures on ecosystems, posing challenges to food and water security, provoking local and regional conflicts while exacerbating the risk of the displacement of people, thereby constituting a major driver of humanitarian needs and threatening the effective enjoyment of human rights.
The EU will continue to support those most in need, seeking to limit and manage the risk of further loss and degradation through policy support, financing and an exchange of best practices, promoting, among others, nature based solutions. The EU welcomes, in this regard, the 2021 Climate Adaptation Summit that is currently taking place, hosted by the Netherlands. EU and Member States will work with partners, including the UN, to develop conflict prevention measures, such as early warning systems and support relevant international instruments, such as the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction.
The Council emphasises the importance environmental issues and climate change have for security and defence, and welcomes the Climate Change and Defence Roadmap: EU Actions addressing the links between climate change and defence, including in the context of the Common Security and Defence Policy, contributing to the wider climate and security nexus.
The transition of the energy sector, responsible for over two-thirds of global greenhouse gas emissions, is central to the path towards climate neutrality. EU energy diplomacy will aim – as its primary goal – to accelerate the global energy transition, while ensuring affordability, safeguarding the environment and achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. To this end, in view of the need for a rapid shift toward climate neutrality, EU energy diplomacy will promote energy efficiency, the deployment of safe and sustainable low-carbon technologies, the increasing uptake and system integration – including through increased interconnections – of renewable energy, and the highest environmental, nuclear safety and transparency standards.
The EU will ensure that its trade policy and its trade agreements are consistent with its climate ambition. The Council acknowledges that the Commission has proposed, with the European Green Deal Communication of December 2019, to make the respect of the Paris Agreement an essential element for all future comprehensive trade agreements. The Council welcomes the initiative of the Commission in the WTO context to ensure multilateral trade rules support the global transition towards a climate neutral and resilient economy.
Investment into fossil fuel based energy infrastructure projects in third countries will be discouraged, unless fully consistent with an ambitious, clearly defined pathway towards climate neutrality in line with the long-term objectives of the Paris Agreement and best available science. The EU also calls for a global phase-out of environmentally harmful fossil-fuel subsidies including a phasing out of unabated coal in energy production and – as a first step – an immediate end to all financing of new coal infrastructure. The EU will support international efforts to reduce the environmental and greenhouse gas impact of existing fossil fuel infrastructure, including non-CO2 emissions, such as black carbon. In this context, the Council underlines the need to mitigate the impact of climate change in the Arctic region, which is particularly affected. In addition, the EU will pursue, as a priority, international initiatives on reductions of methane emissions.
EU diplomacy will scale up efforts to counter disinformation campaigns against the energy transition, within the EU and globally. The EU and its Member States will continue to support the uptake of the EU’s energy acquis, rules and standards, as well as further energy market integration and interconnectivity in line with the European Green Deal, particularly within the EU’s neighbourhood, including the Eastern Mediterranean. The EU will support the ambitions and efforts of countries in the Southern Neighbourhood, Western Balkans and the Eastern Partnership in tackling environmental, climate and energy challenges.
The EU will continue to address energy poverty, building, where possible, on the Team Europe approach. As a priority action, the EU will work with African partners in accordance with the Joint Communication “Towards a comprehensive Strategy with Africa” and develop a strategic and coordinated approach on the energy partnership with Africa, launching an African Union-EU Green Energy Initiative, which should support universal sustainable energy access ambition for Africa; as well as launching the “NaturAfrica” initiative to promote nature conservation, boost job opportunities and help tackle the illegal exploitation of natural resources and biodiversity loss in Africa.
The EU also underlines the importance of enhancing the voice and participation of young generations on policy and practice related to climate, energy and the environment, welcoming the “Youth4Climate: driving ambition” event to be hosted by Italy in September 2021.
The Council invites the High Representative and the Commission to reinforce further the external dimension of the European Green Deal, to make appropriate capacity available, and to strengthen – together with the Member States – coordination and information exchange through, among others, the EU Green Diplomacy Network and the Energy Diplomacy Expert Group. In the run-up to COP 26, EU Delegations and Member States’ Embassies shall increase their outreach and cooperation in a TEAM Europe approach, further projecting the EU’s commitment and leadership in this field.
From the annual global #EUBeachCleanUp, the #BeTheWave campaign that was launched last year, and joining initiatives to #MoveTheDate of Earth Overshoot Day, amongst many more, to funding projects for the mitigation of climate change, the EU is there to support climate action around the world. The stories below are testimony to this, but only reflect a very small window of the bigger picture of what the EU is doing. Although every action matters, the EU Green Deal aims to trigger more and more ambitious and concrete stories of global climate action to achieve the long-term goals of the Paris Agreement.
Belle Mare is a small village situated on the eastern coastal side of the island of Mauritius. Residents are mainly small planters highly vulnerable to a high incidence of pests and disease due to climatic conditions such as high temperature and humidity, and climate extremes, such as drought and high-intensity rainfall.
Fifteen small planters were selected and are beneficiaries of a project for the transformation of Belle Mare into a Climate-Smart Agriculture village, supported by the EU-funded Global Climate Change Alliance Plus (GCCA+). Each of them received water tanks, sprayers for biopesticides and tillers. The final goal is to set a trend to promote sustainable livelihood, enhancing national food security in a productive, climate-resilient, environment-friendly way that produces lower levels of greenhouse gas emissions.

This project is a part of the EU-funded 'IUCN Save Our Species' African Wildlife initiative. Read the full story.
Imbabura, Pichincha, Cotopaxi and Bolívar are four provinces of the Ecuadorian Andes where agriculture generates around 26% of employment and represents more than 20% of the income of its inhabitants.
This is the scenario where the project ""Andean Landscapes: Promoting the integrated management of landscapes for sustainable livelihoods in the Ecuadorian Andes"" is implemented, seeking to improve the quality of life of the páramo communities, and responsibly manage the areas to avoid degradation of land and water sources. The project is part of a broader EU thematic program at global level for the environment and climate change. EU action for sustainable landscape management is linked to the Global Climate Change Alliance + GCCA + initiative that seeks to help developing countries face this challenge. Read the full story.

However, with the installed drip irrigation system, I was able to harvest and sell my melons even after all the other melon plots in the community ran out of produce,” stated Lali Sikhashvili, one of 700 farmers from all over Georgia who participated in training programmes organized by FAO in 2020 with the support of the European Union.

Ever imagined that the plastic bottle you've just disposed of could be someone's home...?
At 28, Tateh Lahbib Braïka is the designer and builder of a new concept of ecological construction, that is both resistant and inexpensive, thanks to plastic bottles. Tateh was raised in the Aousserd camp where he was nicknamed ""bottle-crazy"" by the other refugees. “My neighbors were amazed to see me rummaging through the trash cans to retrieve the bottles,” he says wryly. Like the vast majority of Sahrawi children, Tateh's school career began in the camps and continued in Algeria. He obtained a license in Renewable Energies from the University in Msila, and eventually he joined an Erasmus program, where he studied energy efficiency at the University of Las Palmas in the Canary Islands.

The Arctic, our planet´s icy last frontier for millennia, has recently become a hot spot in every possible way. Representing 6% of the planet’s surface, eight Arctic states -Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden and the United States- share an immense territory that is now at the centre of the geopolitical chessboard due to its economic potential and strategic importance. However, the Arctic is at the same time a fragile environment: home to over four million people –including 700.000 EU citizens and over 40 different indigenous ethnic groups-, it is warming at almost twice the global average rate, while its summer sea ice has decreased by more than 40% since 1979.
Concerned about this delicate scenario, the European Union is leading efforts to keep a safe, stable, sustainable and prosperous Arctic. The integrated EU policy for the Arctic focuses on three main priorities: advancing international cooperation in responding to the impacts of climate change and on promoting and contributing to sustainable development in the region.
“The Arctic is often not well understood. The image that comes to people´s minds is a polar bear on melting ice. What does not quickly come to mind is that you have vibrant cities and communities, industrial parks, universities…Therefore, saying that no economic development can take place in the Arctic is not an option. But we promote a sustainable development”, said the EU Ambassador at Large for the Arctic, Marie-Anne Coninsx, in a recent interview.
Yet beyond the abstract concepts, how does the EU Arctic policy look like on the ground? The EU Arctic Forum, taking place in Umeå (Sweden) on 3-4 October, offers a good opportunity to assess the recent developments and the challenges ahead. From trailblazing scientific research and Green Energy initiatives to Connectivity, support to Arctic SMEs and applied EU Space policies, dozens of EU-funded projects focusing on a wide range of issues are currently operating in the region. Here are five of the most representative examples of what the EU is doing in the remotest place on Earth.
The Arctic’s permafrost coasts make up 34% of the world's coasts. However, this permanently frozen submarine ground is warming up much faster than expected, with worrying consequences for our planet. As permafrost thaws, it is reshaping the Arctic landscape, affecting to local communities whose livelihood depends on marine resources, and releasing carbon gases that fuel global warming.
EU Horizon 2020-funded Nunataryuk project –a word meaning “land to sea” in Inuvialuktun, a native language from northwestern Canada- has brought together high-ranking European and international specialists of the Arctic coast to find a solution to this pressing challenge. Their main goal: to determine the impacts of thawing permafrost on the global climate and local population and develop targeted and co-designed adaptation and mitigation strategies.
Nunataryuk is part of the EU Arctic Cluster, a network of Horizon 2020-funded projects that currently involves 11 research initiatives addressing a broad spectrum of climate change mitigation and adaptation issues.
The European Commission's Earth Observation Program satellites have many applications, including some that are helping to maintain Arctic’s sustainable ways of life. Arctic indigenous peoples have practiced reindeer herding for thousands of years. Every spring and autumn, reindeer herders migrate with their animals hundreds of kilometres between their summer and winter pastures. However, climate change is turning the spring melt even less predictable, making it more difficult for them to find potential migration routes and areas where snow cover has already disappeared. Copernicus satellites currently provide reindeer herders with daily satellite-based snow cover maps that help them deepening their understanding of the changing Arctic.
At the same time, the EU is funding regional projects focused on Internet of Things (IoT)-based solutions to track reindeer herds, which have traditionally roamed freely the tundra and forests. Thanks to wireless collars wore by the animals, their owners can monitor their location and well-being in real-time.

Elderly people aging in remote and sparsely populated areas in European Arctic regions face two challenges: long distances and limited resources. To tackle these obstacles, the EU-funded RemoAge project is supporting them with service packages that include family carers, healthcare staff and digital solutions offering direct, personalized assistance in their daily life.
The programme, set up in collaboration between partners from Sweden, Norway, mainland Scotland, the Western Isles, the Shetland Islands, Faroe Islands and Northern Ireland, is specifically targeted to frail older people, including those with dementia. RemoAge is one among the over 100 projects included in the Northern Periphery and Arctic 2014-2020 programme, supported by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).
Being an entrepreneur in an extreme environment like the Arctic can be challenging. This is why the European Union funds several projects helping Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) to develop and expand their business activities.
One of them is Northern Cereals – New Markets for a Changing Environment (CEREAL), a transnational cooperation project aiming to help farmers in remote regions to better adjust to climate change and increase sustainability to boost local cereal production. Warmer growing conditions, improved varieties and technologies, and growing concerns about sustainability are creating new opportunities for a greater cereal production in northern areas. Knowledge transfer among the partners -coming from Iceland, Northern Norway, Faroe Islands, Scotland and Canada- is crucial for a project that has already contributed to increase the numbers of farmers producing high-value cereal products in these regions, thus boosting local employment, incomes and consumer choice in rural areas.
Another example of a project supporting Arctic local economies is ARCTISEN -‘Culturally Sensitive Tourism in the Arctic’-, an EU-funded initiative that supports start-ups and SMEs offering innovative tourism products and services. Its main goal is to expand tourist interest in the Arctic, which will bring “unforeseen opportunities to maintain local livelihoods and lifestyles”.
Gender-aware-business support is another priority of the EU Arctic policy. The W-Power project, also part of the Northern Periphery and Arctic programme, counts with €1.3 million to support new women-led starts-ups across the Nordic and Arctic region.

Declining Arctic traditional fishing communities are facing a threat to their way of life and beautiful wildlife: plastic fishing litter reaching their coastlines in ever-increasing quantities. What could be done? The EU-funded Circular Ocean project has come up with a solution: using these old plastic fishing nets and ropes, which represent 10% of marine waste, to develop smart ‘green’ industries. This waste is a potential resource for many industries, as it can be incorporated into different products, from clothing to skateboards.
The project, funded by the European Regional Development Fund, is contributing this way to clean up the environment and recycling marine waste while breathing new life into these remote Arctic economies.",,,,European Commission|European Union|EU,,EEAS - European External Action Service - European Commission

_______________________
Last summer, I had the incredible opportunity to visit Arctic Alaska. It is a region that’s as vast as it is beautiful. It is also an area that’s critical for the health of our planet. Often referred to as “the world’s refrigerator,” the Arctic plays an essential role in regulating global temperatures and counteracting climate change.
But, the Arctic is in trouble.
Experiencing accelerated effects of climate crisis, it is warming at twice the rate as the rest of the globe.
And a melting Arctic should alarm everyone. These dramatic shifts are further destabilizing temperatures around the world, and threatening one of the most vital and pristine ecosystems on the planet.
Incredibly, for some, the diminishing sea ice opens new opportunity. For the first time ever, there exists the possibility of cargo traffic through Arctic sea routes that were previously unnavigable. The draw is decreased transit times compared to traditional routes. While not yet a regular service offered by ocean container carriers, transit through the Northeast Passage is a very real possibility. Test voyages completed by some ocean carriers and studies estimate the Northern Sea Route could be used for approximately 8% of total container trade between Asia and Europe by 2030, increasing to ~10% of such trade by 2050. We do not have to accept that outcome.
The science is clear. Even with regulation, substantial and irreversible risk to the environment exists in the form of oil spills, emissions, vessel strikes and invasive species, which not only impact marine life, but also the human populations that rely on a healthy Arctic ecosystem for their livelihood. Beyond that, it’s estimated that carbon emissions from shipping via the Northeastern Passage would be significantly higher due to the need for smaller, less efficient vessels and increased fuel requirements.
It shouldn’t be an option for anyone.
At Nike, we exist to serve athletes. That means protecting the future of sport by helping to protect the planet and taking climate action through Move to Zero, Nike’s journey towards a zero carbon, zero waste future. We know climate change impacts how and where our athletes train and play, and whether they get to enjoy sport at all.
If there is no planet, there is no sport.
For Nike, this means thinking about how we design and make our product all the way through to how our products are delivered all over the world – and we’ve made a clear choice – it won’t be through the Arctic.
We’ve made a commitment to not intentionally allow our products to be shipped on vessels via any Arctic sea route. And, we’re partnering with Ocean Conservancy, a leading advocate for the oceans and waterways, to encourage all companies and industries to make the same commitment through the Arctic Shipping Corporate Pledge (“Pledge”).
We’re joined in making this Pledge by Bestseller, Columbia, Gap Inc., H&M Group, Kering, Li & Fung, PVH Corp., and ocean carriers CMA CGM, Evergreen, Hapag-Lloyd and Mediterranean Shipping Company, all companies who are helping to preserve the Arctic through their commitment.
Together, we can all protect the Arctic. It’s critical to everyone’s future.

Lex Oren
Background
The Arctic is defined as the region of land and sea area north of the Arctic Circle, latitude at or about 66.34o north.[i] Recent decades have demonstrated the reduction of polar ice, disappearing glaciers, rising seas, and surface temperatures. These events have led to the formation of new sea lanes, opening up access that has until now been blocked by an unforgiving, frozen environment. These sea lanes present new risks associated with national security, economic development, and transportation opportunities that have the potential to impact multiple countries across all hemispheres.
The Department of Defense, as one component of a whole-of-government approach, in conjunction with allied nations can deter Russian dominance in the Arctic Ocean by integrating efforts across Geographic Combatant Command boundaries and leveraging multi-national support to demonstrate a united front. Limited resources dedicated to addressing Arctic challenges in addition to the overwhelming geographic responsibilities provides gaps in American national security. A lack of clear international policies and an understanding of the importance of the Arctic has prohibited the U.S. to respond appropriately to Russia’s activities in the Arctic. The invasion of the Ukraine, interfering with global cybersecurity by suspected tampering with the Democratic election process in the United States and conducting military operations in the Syrian civil war through proxies, indicate Russia is undeniably testing its military capabilities in operations other than war. “Fighting in the gray zone allows weaker states to achieve its foreign policy objectives without resorting to full scale military campaigns”.[ii] The gray zone encompasses those areas of state competition where antagonist actions take place; however, those actions fall short of the red lines that would typically result in armed conflict between nations.[iii]
The Arctic Sea is a significant expanse for American security and has repeatedly been under-resourced by the Department of Defense (DoD). Without access to the sea and airspace that the freedom of the seas provides, the United States’ ability to maintain a forward presence and accomplish a range of military and humanitarian assistance missions will be compromised.[iv] On May 8, 2019, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Joseph Dunford Jr. reported to Congress during the 2020 Defense Budget Request and stated: “Combatant Commanders only have intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) assets covering approximately 30% of the Arctic.”[v] This conditional statement from the United States’ most senior military officer should be a prompt for the Geographic Combatant Commanders to articulate resource constraints.
International Interest in the Arctic
There are eight Arctic States across the seven seas. These include the Russian Federation, which has the longest Arctic coast of any state, whose coastline reaches its border with Norway east to the Bering Strait. Additionally, Denmark, by way of its territorial sovereignty over Greenland, followed by Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Canada and the United States by Alaska (figure I) make up the Arctic States. These eight member states represent the Arctic Council which is the leading intergovernmental forum. This council promotes cooperation, coordination, and interaction among the Arctic States, indigenous communities and other Arctic inhabitants on common Arctic issues, in particular in matters of sustainable development and environmental protection in the Arctic.[vi]
Russia’s interest in the Arctic can be grouped into four categories: economics, security, transportation, and development.[viii] Additionally, the creation of new sea lanes will create more efficient connections between Asia and the Atlantic Ocean. These newly created sea lines of communication (SLOC) have the potential for global gains in transportation, commercial shipping, and military posturing. As an Arctic nation, Vladimir Putin has renewed Russian attention to the Northern Sea Routes (NSR), as part of a “national economic strategy that marked the end of the decline and a new vision of the NSR as a core component of Russia’s economic development strategy in a statement on board the nuclear icebreaker Arktika, August 2000.[ix] Seven years later in August 2007, “the world reacted with consternation as Russia planted a flag beneath the ice of the North Pole, symbolizing the Kremlin’s claim to the Arctic with its vast mineral resources, and firing the starting gun on the world’s last colonial scramble.”[x] The Kremlins’ actions demonstrated that Russia is going to assert its sovereignty and influence within the Arctic region, and that there are voids associated in the knowledge and application of Arctic security. These vacancies in security are relevant because the U.S. does have an identity as an Arctic Nation, albeit not a common viewpoint in everyday discussions within the civilian or military population. [xi]
For the United States to contend in the gray zone with Russia, a high degree of statesmanship will be required. Governing bodies in Congress, the Department of State, and the Department of Defense must adhere to a firm stance thus indicating the red line of tolerance the U.S. will accept. However, before America launches its countermeasures to deter or compete in the gray zone, a grand strategic policy should be adopted with clearly identified ends that are nested with American values and have the support of the civilian population. Russia’s ambiguous actions are threats to the Western Hemisphere. Thus, it is vital to understand the gray zone and how to combat the aggression, while preventing an escalation of military power projection that can be viewed as acts of war.[xii]
The U.S. Geological Survey has projected that over 60 percent of the total natural resources, equivalent to about 412 billion barrels of oil are located in Russian territory, with only a small percentage onshore or inside the exclusive economic zone EEZ).[xiii] Due to the melting polar ice, opportunities are becoming more abundant for acquiring these natural resources, reminiscent of the land grab in the western territories of the United States in the 19th century. It is evident, by the sheer size of Russia’s Arctic naval capabilities that they are becoming an immense rimland coastal power.[xiv]
New sea lines of communication, access to natural resources and power projection into the Western Hemisphere provide strategic value to northern expansion. The benefit of Russia’s limited access to the high seas practically forced Moscow to look to the north for sea routes. To ensure Russian dominance in the Arctic, the Russian Navy and Coastal Border Guard are robust in comparison to other Arctic nations. The Coastal Border Guard, comparable to those of similar services in the Western Hemisphere, is responsible for observing maritime activities along the coast and in the Exclusive Economic Zone and for imposing national laws and regulations.[xv] The EEZ recognizes the right of coastal states to exploit, develop, manage, and conserve all resources found in the water, seabed, and seabed subsoil in an area extending two hundred nautical miles from its shore.[xvi]
To compliment the Coastal Border Guard, the Northern Sea Route (NSR) depends on powerful icebreakers to open routes through the ice and to escort shipping all year long. Russia has six nuclear icebreakers, four of the heavy Arktika class and two of the shallow-draft Taymyr class that maintain the NSR, and significant Russian commercial enterprises have begun acquiring their icebreaking cargo ships.[xvii] In contrast, the United States currently has only two heavy ice breakers that are resources of the U.S. Coast Guard, an element of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). They are the Polar Star and the Polar Sea, both of which have exceeded their 30-year life expectancy. Significantly, one of the two vessels has not been in a working status since 2010, thus limiting the U.S. to only one critical asset, the Polar Star.[xviii] Fortuitously the Coast Guard, in collaboration with the U.S. Navy anticipates a $9.827 Billion acquisition over the next 30 years.[xix]
Governance and Disputes
The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) was agreed upon and concluded in 1982, establishing the lawful governance of the Arctic. The Ilulissat Declaration of 2008 pledges the five Arctic coastal states (the Russian Federation, Canada, Norway, Denmark, and the United States) to resolve matters and disputes through diplomatic channels.[xx] Interestingly, there is a lack of an enforcement mechanism to prevent the Russian Arctic expansion;[xxi] albeit communication and collaboration have taken place amongst the Arctic states on environmental issues and search and rescue operations.
Another matter related explicitly to the Western Hemisphere is the relationship between the U.S. and Canada. Canada and the United States have a consolidated command structure at the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) that demonstrates our ability to work together for a common goal. However, Canada asserts its national rights regarding the Northwest Passage, parts of which fall under Canadian jurisdiction according to Canada but not according to the United States.[xxii] This display of argumentative political rhetoric is an example of one aspect that Russia can exploit. It is in the interest of the North American countries and Greenland to have a united front in the Arctic to dispel any notations of weakness in their resolve.
Climate Change
“Climate change” refers to a set of physical phenomena and constitutes a public policy issue, sometimes also referred to as “global warming” even though climate change involves much more than warming.[xxiii] The U.S. Global Change Research Program and the National Research Council have made scientific based statements concerning climate change, two of which are particularly relevant to this article. The first is that Arctic sea ice, warmer and more frequent hot days and nights, rising sea levels and widespread ocean acidification have been occurring over the past several decades and second, “human-induced climate change and its impacts will continue for many decades, and in some cases for many centuries.”[xxiv] These points are relevant for the reason that academic institutions confirm the Arctic seas are affected by warming temperatures and that the end of this phenomenon is nowhere in sight.
The inaction of the U.S. and its allies to increase their presence in the Arctic will open the door for Russia to enhance military operations in the Arctic seas. Threats to national security from international migration, overfishing of the waters, loss of habitat, environmental pollution, new commercial sea routes and foreign military basing can be linked to climate change and is a concern for military planners operating in the strategic domain.
Moreover, the variance between confirmation and denial of climate change likely stifles the demand for military presence by the U.S. governing bodies and their constituents. In this instance, the common phrase “ignorance is bliss” may lead to the need for more significant national defense in the future. Social indicators have led groups to study how the media impacts awareness of climate change. The average layperson bases his knowledge of climate change on social media and news outlets. The source of information is not from climate scientists directly, but rather to intermediary sources, predominately in the mass media, that present data and opinions in language and graphics that are easy to comprehend.[xxv] Accurate or not, media reports influence people’s thoughts and feelings.[xxvi] The U.S. government has a need to leverage scientific evidence with the will of the people to generate the need for increased resources and funding to combat climate change and enhance national security.
Department of Defense and Global Integration
The National Security Strategy (NSS) published from the White House sets the groundwork for the overarching grand strategy or policy of the United States Government. Subsequent is the Unified Command Plan (UCP), guidance from the President assigning areas of responsibility (AOR).[xxvii] The President has appointed command of the Arctic maritime AOR to the dual-hatted United States Northern Command (USNORTHCOM) and NORAD commanding General. NORAD has the mission to provide maritime warnings in the North American hemisphere.[xxviii] The USNORTHCOM combatant commander issues the Combatant Commander Campaign Plans (CCP) in a coordinated effort with Canada’s command authority.
The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS) is designated by Title 10 authority as the Global Integrator.[xxix] In this capacity, he is authorized to identify the primary and supporting Geographic Combatant Commands (GCC) across geographic limits to enable unified actions and the joint force. The Arctic currently shares borders with the geographic boundaries of USNORTHCOM and United States European Command (USEURCOM). These GCC also border the United States Indo-Pacific Command (USINDOPACOM) which due to its joining boundaries and sheer size is a potential supporting GCC to the Arctic operations (The defense.gov map in Figure II).
Geographic Combatant Command Areas of Responsibility [xxx]
Conclusion
A lack of clear international policies and an understanding of the importance of the Arctic has prohibited the U.S. to respond appropriately to Russia’s Arctic activities. As Russia increases its influence, it is in the interest of the United States and its Allies to ensure Western competition counters or denies unabated access to Arctic waters within its strategic area of interest. The amount of land and water that is consistently unobserved constitutes a threat to the security of the Western Hemisphere and will require a globally integrated approach with supporting combatant commands. It is also in the interest of the U.S. to solidify disputed territorial boundaries with Canada to have internationally recognized territorial waters undisputed with neighboring countries. Failure to present a unified effort to deter Russia will be viewed as a weakness of the global communities and may lead to more significant acts of aggression. “If the United States takes no action, its political system, credibility, and influence, among other things, will remain under constant subversive attack”.[xxxi]

The Arctic's unique nature is still relatively undisturbed. It is very rich in resources such as hydrocarbons and fish stocks. However, it is under intensifying pressure from pollution, climate change and unsustainable development. It is vitally important that increasing economic development such as hydrocarbon exploitation and new shipping routes takes fully into account the preservation of this unique and highly vulnerable environment. Some four million people live in the Arctic region including nearly half a million EU citizens.
Three EU Member States - Denmark (Greenland), Finland and Sweden — have territories in the Arctic. Two other Arctic states - Iceland and Norway - are members of the European Economic Area. Canada, Russia and the United States are strategic partners of the EU. European Arctic areas are a priority in the Northern Dimension policy. Beyond areas of national jurisdiction, the Arctic Ocean contains parts pertaining to the high seas and the seabed managed by the International Seabed Authority.
The EU is a party to the Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-west Atlantic (OSPAR) which covers about one-third of the Arctic Ocean up to the North Pole. Many other multilateral environmental agreements apply to the Arctic to some extent (where Arctic States are parties). The European Union's application to become a Permanent Observer on the Arctic Council was received affirmatively by the Kiruna ministerial (May 2013) but the final decision on implementation is still pending. The EU is a member of the Barents Euro-Arctic Council (BEAC).
The Arctic is a key driver of the world ocean and climate system and plays a vitally important part in many other environmental issues. The impact of climate change on the Arctic is already evident. Continuation of these trends would have profound consequences both for the Arctic and the global environment.
Key issues include:
Long range transport of pollution - the Arctic is a global sink for contaminants discharged from industry, energy production, agriculture and other human activities. Persistent organic pollutants and mercury are of special concern. Contaminants are concentrated in the thick fat tissues that Arctic animals need for insulation and energy reserve, and which are consumed by humans.
Biodiversity - some ecosystems and species are clearly put at risk; maybe most clearly the hundreds of endemic species specially adapted for life on the sea ice. Many migrating species from Europe depend on the high productivity of the Arctic ecosystems in summer for foraging and reproduction: birds, whales, fish – some of them commercially harvested with high economic value.
Environmental impacts of economic development – increasing oil, gas and mineral exploration, shipping and tourism puts pressure on the vulnerable Arctic environment. It is essential to have clear and effective policies in place to manage these risks.
Knowledge and understanding of the Arctic environment – the EU is making a major contribution to research, monitoring and assessment of Arctic environmental issues and trends through funding of projects under the EU Research Framework Programmes and through the assessments that were carried out by the European Environment Agency.
The EU role
The EU is committed to working with the Arctic States, local communities and other stakeholders to address these environmental challenges. In 2016, the Commission and the High Representative published a Joint Communication on an integrated EU policy for the Arctic structured around three priorities, namely:
An update to the 2016 EU Arctic Communication is foreseen for 2021.
In addition, the Arctic was also identified as a priority in other strategic documents such as the EU Global Strategy and the 7th Environmental Action Programme.
In 2010, DG Environment funded a study to assess the EU's environmental footprint on the Arctic and to assess policy options to reduce the footprint. Details of the study can be found here. An update of this work is underway as part of an ongoing study into the EU’s impact on the Arctic (due for completion in 2021).

The Arctic's unique nature is still relatively undisturbed. It is very rich in resources such as hydrocarbons and fish stocks. However, it is under intensifying pressure from pollution, climate change and unsustainable development. It is vitally important that increasing economic development such as hydrocarbon exploitation and new shipping routes takes fully into account the preservation of this unique and highly vulnerable environment. Some four million people live in the Arctic region including nearly half a million EU citizens.
Three EU Member States - Denmark (Greenland), Finland and Sweden — have territories in the Arctic. Two other Arctic states - Iceland and Norway - are members of the European Economic Area. Canada, Russia and the United States are strategic partners of the EU. European Arctic areas are a priority in the Northern Dimension policy. Beyond areas of national jurisdiction, the Arctic Ocean contains parts pertaining to the high seas and the seabed managed by the International Seabed Authority.
The EU is a party to the Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-west Atlantic (OSPAR) which covers about one-third of the Arctic Ocean up to the North Pole. Many other multilateral environmental agreements apply to the Arctic to some extent (where Arctic States are parties). The European Union's application to become a Permanent Observer on the Arctic Council was received affirmatively by the Kiruna ministerial (May 2013) but the final decision on implementation is still pending. The EU is a member of the Barents Euro-Arctic Council (BEAC).
The Arctic is a key driver of the world ocean and climate system and plays a vitally important part in many other environmental issues. The impact of climate change on the Arctic is already evident. Continuation of these trends would have profound consequences both for the Arctic and the global environment.
Key issues include:
Long range transport of pollution - the Arctic is a global sink for contaminants discharged from industry, energy production, agriculture and other human activities. Persistent organic pollutants and mercury are of special concern. Contaminants are concentrated in the thick fat tissues that Arctic animals need for insulation and energy reserve, and which are consumed by humans.
Biodiversity - some ecosystems and species are clearly put at risk; maybe most clearly the hundreds of endemic species specially adapted for life on the sea ice. Many migrating species from Europe depend on the high productivity of the Arctic ecosystems in summer for foraging and reproduction: birds, whales, fish – some of them commercially harvested with high economic value.
Environmental impacts of economic development – increasing oil, gas and mineral exploration, shipping and tourism puts pressure on the vulnerable Arctic environment. It is essential to have clear and effective policies in place to manage these risks.
Knowledge and understanding of the Arctic environment – the EU is making a major contribution to research, monitoring and assessment of Arctic environmental issues and trends through funding of projects under the EU Research Framework Programmes and through the assessments that were carried out by the European Environment Agency.
The EU role
The EU is committed to working with the Arctic States, local communities and other stakeholders to address these environmental challenges. In 2016, the Commission and the High Representative published a Joint Communication on an integrated EU policy for the Arctic structured around three priorities, namely:
An update to the 2016 EU Arctic Communication is foreseen for 2021.
In addition, the Arctic was also identified as a priority in other strategic documents such as the EU Global Strategy and the 7th Environmental Action Programme.
In 2010, DG Environment funded a study to assess the EU's environmental footprint on the Arctic and to assess policy options to reduce the footprint. Details of the study can be found here. An update of this work is underway as part of an ongoing study into the EU’s impact on the Arctic (due for completion in 2021).

This sea ice grows dramatically each winter, usually reaching its maximum in March. It melts just as dramatically each summer, reaching its minimum in September. It is a natural fluctuation that has been going on for thousands of years, but winter and summer trends have become negative in recent decades.
These image pairs show the average concentration of Arctic sea ice for the month of September (left) and the following March (right) from September 1990 to March 2020. Opaque white areas indicate the greatest concentration, and dark blue areas are open water. All icy areas pictured here have an ice concentration of at least 15 percent (the minimum at which space-based measurements give a reliable measure), and cover a total area that scientists refer to as the “ice extent.”
The yellow outline on each image shows the median sea ice extent for September and March as observed by satellites from 1981 to 2010. The median is the middle value; that is, half of the extents were larger than the line, and half were smaller.
Since 1978, satellites have monitored sea ice growth and retreat, and they have detected an overall decline in Arctic sea ice. The rate of decline has steepened in the 21st century. In September 2002, the summer minimum ice extent was the lowest it had been since 1979. Although the September 2002 low was only slightly below previous lows, it was the beginning of a series of record or near-record lows in the Arctic.
The new summer lows, combined with poor wintertime recoveries, have fueled a persistent decline in Arctic sea ice. Since 2002, ice extent at the summer minimum has not returned to anything approaching the long-term average. Though winter ice extent has fluctuated, satellite and in situ observations have shown that there is much less multiyear ice and more annual ice.
Cycles of natural variability such as the Arctic Oscillation are known to play a role in Arctic sea ice extent, but the sharp decline cannot be explained by natural variability alone. Natural variability and rising global temperatures have worked together to melt greater amounts of Arctic sea ice. Some modelers have forecast an ice-free Arctic for at least part of the year before the end of the 21st century.
The time series above is made from a combination of observations from microwave sensors flown on a series of Defense Meteorological Satellite Program missions. The sensors measure microwave energy radiated from the Earth’s surface (sea ice and open water emit microwaves differently), which can be used to map sea ice concentrations.

Arctic and Antarctic Sea Ice: How Are They Different?
We often get questions from readers about Earth’s sea ice in the Arctic and the Antarctic, and the differences between those areas. Arctic sea ice has declined over the past five decades, while Antarctic sea ice has increased, and then declined. Why do they behave differently?
How They’re Different
The primary difference between the Arctic and Antarctica is geographical. The Arctic is an ocean, covered by a thin layer of perennial sea ice and surrounded by land. (""Perennial"" refers to the oldest and thickest sea ice.) Antarctica, on the other hand, is a continent, covered by a very thick ice cap and surrounded by a rim of sea ice and the Southern Ocean.
The Arctic Ocean is very deep and closely linked with the climate systems around it, making it more sensitive to climate changes than Antarctica.
During the centuries of human exploration in the Arctic, sea ice covered the Arctic Ocean well year-round, up until recent decades. But satellite observations show that Arctic sea ice has been declining in extent*, thickness and volume since 1979.1 Average Arctic sea ice extent is at its lowest since 1850.
During the summer melt season, the sea ice’s edge retreats toward the North Pole, only to re-grow during the Arctic winter. As a result of ongoing warming driven by human activities, the trend toward summer sea ice loss (from July to September, followed by a winter re-growth) continues.
Recent research suggests that there is a relationship between Arctic sea ice losses and the human burning of fossil fuels in all months.2 Aerosols (tiny particles suspended in the atmosphere) tied to human activities have offset some of the Arctic sea ice extent loss trend; a reduction in aerosol pollution will likely see a sea ice loss acceleration.3 Ice loss at the sea ice’s margins** results in winds driving warmer water beneath the Arctic sea ice, increasing the amount of heat the Arctic Ocean stores 4 and priming conditions for further sea ice loss.
A figure showing current Arctic sea ice extent can be found here.
Antarctic Sea Ice
Antarctic sea ice expands during the winter, only to melt back largely to the continent’s edge in summer.
Antarctic sea ice extent is currently below the long-term average of all decades prior since 1979. Previously, Antarctic sea ice extent had been above that long-term average due to long-term, large-scale wind circulation patterns that drove sea ice away from Antarctica5, making room for more sea ice to form nearer to the continent.6 Climate models, or computer simulations that incorporate all the factors that affect Earth’s climate, predicted this behavior.7 These long-term wind patterns reversed several years ago, resulting in a significant sea ice decline surrounding Antarctica. Values since then have been hovering around the average of all years prior in the satellite record. A figure showing current Antarctic sea ice extent can be found here.
Why Sea Ice Matters
Some of the questions we receive ask why we should care about the polar regions. These regions are very important in regulating global temperature. Because sea ice has a bright surface, 50-70 percent of incoming energy is reflected back into space. As sea ice melts in the summer, it exposes the dark ocean surface. Instead of reflecting 50-70 percent of the sunlight, it absorbs 90 percent of the sunlight. As the ocean warms, global temperatures rise further.
Also, what happens in the polar regions doesn’t stay in those regions. Their changes affect global temperatures and can even change ocean circulation. Earth’s sea ice is very attuned and responsive to even small changes in global surface and ocean temperatures.

In winter, frozen seawater covers almost the entire Arctic Ocean and neighboring seas. This sea ice undergoes seasonal patterns of change – thinning and shrinking during late spring and summer, and thickening and expanding during fall and winter. The extent of summer sea ice in the Arctic can impact local ecosystems, regional and global weather patterns, and ocean circulation. In the last two decades, the minimum extent of Arctic sea ice in the summer has dropped markedly. The lowest extent on record was set in 2012, and last year’s extent was tied for second – until this year’s.
A Siberian heat wave in spring 2020 began this year’s Arctic sea ice melt season early, and with Arctic temperatures being 14 to 18 degrees Fahrenheit (8 to 10 degrees Celsius) warmer than average, the ice extent kept declining. The 2020 minimum extent was 958,000 square miles (2.48 million square kilometers) below the 1981-2010 average of yearly minimum extents, and 2020 is only the second time on record that the minimum extent has fallen below 1.5 million square miles (4 million square kilometers).

“It was just really warm in the Arctic this year, and the melt seasons have been starting earlier and earlier,” said Nathan Kurtz, a sea ice scientist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. “The earlier the melt season starts, the more ice you generally lose.”
Thin ice also melts quicker than thicker floes. Dramatic drops in sea ice extent in 2007 and 2012, along with generally declining summer extent, has led to fewer regions of thick, multi-year ice that has built up over multiple winters. In addition, a recent study showed that warmer water from the Atlantic Ocean, which is typically deep below the colder Arctic waters, is creeping up closer to the bottom of the sea ice and warming it from below.
There are cascading effects in the Arctic, said Mark Serreze, director of NSIDC. Warmer ocean temperatures eat away at the thicker multiyear ice, and also result in thinner ice to start the spring melt season. Melt early in the season results in more open water, which absorbs heat from the Sun and increases water temperatures.
“As the sea ice cover extent declines, what we’re seeing is we’re continuing to lose that multiyear ice,” Serreze said. “The ice is shrinking in the summer, but it’s also getting thinner. You’re losing extent, and you’re losing the thick ice as well. It’s a double whammy.”
The second lowest extent of sea ice on record is just one of many signs of a warming climate in the north, he said, pointing to the Siberian heat waves, forest fires, hotter-than-average temperatures over the Central Arctic, and the thawing permafrost that led to a Russian fuel spill.

Here's our top 10 interesting facts about the ""clowns of the tundra"", the Arctic fox.","By: Liz Carino
While polar bears are the most popular animals that travellers want to see and photograph when visiting the Arctic, the Arctic fox is another favourite among guests!
With their playful nature, once encountered, the Arctic fox instantly gains popularity with guests. Arctic foxes have such a cheeky personality that they are also known as the “clowns of the tundra” – as our past guests and Expedition Leaders on Polar Bear Migration Fly-In Photo Safari can attest!
What makes this small, Northern animal so remarkable? Here are 10 fun facts about Arctic fox:
1. Arctic foxes (Vulpes Lagopus) are extremely well-adapted to the harsh, frigid temperatures of the Arctic.
Their thick fur enables them to maintain a consistent body temperature and provides insulation. Plus, their short legs, short muzzle and rounded ears all reduce the amount of surface area for heat loss, and their feet are covered in fur.
2. The Arctic fox has the warmest pelt of any animal found in the Arctic, enduring temperatures as low as -70 °C.
Once conditions get too cold, its metabolism increases to provide warmth.
3. The Arctic fox is a member of the canidae family of animals.
They are related to other foxes, wolves and dogs.
4. They are primarily solitary animals living on the Arctic tundra and pack ice.
5. Arctic Fox does not hibernate and their fur changes colours with the seasons.
In the summer the Arctic fox has a brown or great coat with a lighter belly. It then turns into a thick white one in the winter. It is the only canid that changes the colour of its coat, allowing it to camouflage with the snow and ice in the winter and rocks and plants in the summer.
6. About the size of a large domestic cat, the Arctic fox is the smallest wild canid found in Canada.
Females tend to be smaller than males, and their bushy tails make up 30-35% of their total length.
7. Arctic foxes are well-known for their hunting style.
They are carnivores and scavengers, and they hunt rodents, birds and even fish. In winter, prey can be scarce, prompting Arctic foxes to bring out their cheeky sides. They are known to follow in the footsteps of the Arctic’s premier predator, the polar bear, and feed on leftover scraps.
8. Arctic foxes are monogamous animals.
They mate for life!
9. Females give birth in the spring.
They have large litters of 5-8 pups! Parents raise the pups together during the summer.
10. They live in burrows, with extensive tunnel systems.
But in a blizzard they are known to tunnel into the snow to create shelter.
Want to see them this year?
View them in October and November on Polar Bear Migration Fly-In Photo Safari.
You can also see them in March on Polar Bear Mother and Newborn Cubs Photo Safari.

This page provides articles about the Arctic Ocean from different subject areas,"Due to construction work in the sea, shipping, and gas and oil extraction, the oceans are becoming increasingly louder.

After more than a year in the Central Arctic, this Monday, 12 October, the research icebreaker Polarstern returned to her homeport in Bremerhaven. Accompanied by a ‘welcome committee’ of ships that came to greet, the ship entered the North Lock with the morning high tide, at ca. 9:00 am.
The Arctic sea-ice extent is the lowest it’s ever been in July since the beginning of satellite observation. The sea-ice retreat is especially pronounced off the Siberian coast, as a result of which the Northeast Passage (also referred to as the Northern Sea Route) was ice-free by mid-July.
