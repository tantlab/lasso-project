icelandreview,https://www.icelandreview.com/news/environmental-issues-among-icelands-top-five-challenges/ https://www.icelandreview.com/magazine/ ,"Icelanders have become increasingly aware of and concerned about environmental issues since the turn of the century, RÚV reports. For instance, the majority of Icelanders think that the government is not doing enough to limit greenhouse gas emissions in Iceland. Just under 60% of Icelanders are concerned about the effects of climate change, and 87% can envision purchasing an electric or eco-friendly car.
These are some of the findings of an extensive Gallup poll about Icelander’s attitudes towards environmental issues, which have come to the forefront of public discussion in recent years. To wit: only 18% of Icelanders said that they were interested in the environment around the year 2000, whereas 37% say they are interested in it today. And while Icelanders don’t generally perceive the environment to be the foremost problem faced by the nation, it does rank among what Icelanders see as their country’s top five challenges. 77% of Icelanders stated that health care ranked #1. This was followed by issues related to wealth inequality and poverty, then transportation, then education issues. The environment ranked fifth, with 23% of Icelanders believing that environmental issues are among the country’s greatest challenges.
Electric car ownership was one of many related topics covered in the survey, which found that 8% of respondents say they already own an electric or hybrid vehicle. 83% of respondents can imagine purchasing a car powered by environmentally friendly energy sources, however, with 57% preferring an electric hybrid and 49% opting for a fully electric car.
Árni Finnsson, chairman of the Iceland Nature Conservation Association, says there’s been a great need for a survey like this, as it’s been two years since Gallup last conducted one on the same subject matter in Iceland. The previous survey yielded similar results, showing, among other things, that the public believes that the government needs to do a lot more regarding environmental issues. Árni says that the public is waiting for government policies that don’t yet exist, but that Iceland has work on these issues at home, in order to have the credibility to advocate for better climate change policies in the world at large.
“We’re just one part of the world that has to deal with this problem,” he said. “Our case is never stronger than when we can make arguments based on what we’re doing at home. We have to do our homework so that we have credibility when we’re calling on other nations to come through.” . The 2014 Eruption in Holuhraun
As the eruption by Fagradalsfjall in the Reykjanes peninsula began, many feared that air traffic would halt as it did during the 2010 Eyjafjallajökull eruption. Lucky for us (and the rest of Europe) the Fagradalsfjall eruption is a fissure eruption that isn’t coming up under the ocean, a lake, or a glacier. Instead, it produces slow-flowing lava that sputters up from a long fissure before lazily sliding down the valley until it cools from a bright red or yellow to a dull, craggy black. Only the steam rising from the fresh rock indicates the enormous heat that lies below.
In fact, the eruption has a lot more in common with the 2014 eruption in Holuhraun, albeit on a much smaller scale.
In Focus: One Year of COVID-19 in Iceland
February 28 marks one year since Iceland’s first diagnosed case of COVID-19.
Buried
Once upon a time, there was a brave Viking chief called Ingólfur Arnarson. He took to the open ocean along with his family and farmhands to seek out a land far across the sea that only a handful of explorers had visited. When Ingólfur saw this new, uninhabited land rise from the sea, knowing nothing of its opportunities or the challenges it presented, he asked the gods for direction on where to settle. Ingólfur threw his high-seat pillars overboard, swearing an oath to build his farm wherever they came ashore. The gods directed the pillars to Reykjavík, where Ingólfur made his home in the year 874.
Clearing the Air
Not long after it signed the Paris Agreement, the Icelandic government set an even more ambitious goal: to achieve carbon neutrality by 2040, ten years earlier than the agreement outlined. Since then, the City of Reykjavík, the National Power Company, and the National Church have all hopped on board, with their own timelines for reaching carbon neutrality by 2040 or sooner. While it seems that Icelanders are ready to roll up their sleeves and get to work, they have a daunting task ahead of them.
So how do you make a country carbon neutral? Experts, activists, and decision makers are realising that it’s not one step at a time. Rather, it’s many steps at once, in time with the steps of others – a co-ordinated dance towards a brighter future.
Music and Lyrics
If you google “Icelandic musicians,” his picture appears third from the right – right next to Björk and Of Monsters and Men.
Born on July 1, 1992 in Akureyri, Ásgeir Trausti Einarsson aspired to a career in javelin-throwing or music. When a prolonged back injury put an end to his athletic ambitions, he narrowed his attention to songwriting.
Raising Riders
To reach Hólar University in winter, you must drive through the ice-covered Hjaltadalur valley. On your way there, you’ll pass groups of horses in almost every colour of the rainbow. You’ll notice their thick and shaggy winter coat, and how they huddle together to keep warm. The snow on their furry backs might send a shiver down yours – but the horses have been here for a millennium, bred to survive the harsh conditions.
Hungry for More
When opening acclaimed restaurant Agern in New York, Gunnar Karl Gíslason tasted twenty different types of butter before he found one he liked. His pastry chefs sourced several kinds of organic milk because the ice creams made from regular milk tasted off to him. He never did end up finding lamb that met his standards in the US, though he found a single farm in the mountains of Pennsylvania whose grass-fed sheep he deemed adequate to serve his guests. But in Reykjavík, he’ll scarf down the local classic – a hot dog with ‘everything:’ crispy fried onion, fresh onion, mustard, remoulade, and ketchup – like the Akureyri-raised country boy he is. There’s a catch though: he’ll only get one from certain shops where they heat the sausages the way he likes them and serve the right kind of ketchup.
Western promises
While most people today are very much aware of Europe’s exploration and colony building in what was optimistically called the New World, you would be forgiven for not knowing that Icelanders founded a self-governing colony in the Americas as well. New Iceland was established on the shores of Lake Winnipeg, Manitoba in the late 19th century, beginning with the settlement of Gimli, named after “the most beautiful place on Earth” in Norse mythology. It is estimated that nearly 25% of the entire population of Iceland emigrated to North America over the four decades that followed.
Staging stories
At the time of our interview, Brynhildur Guðjónsdóttir has been the director of the Reykjavík City Theatre for exactly five days. She’s known that the job was hers for only ten days: the former director left before her four-year term was over and asked to be released immediately. As I congratulate her and ask how it’s going, her first reaction is the following: “Well, my calendar is full, that’s for sure.” Despite the busy times ahead, the development is a positive one. “There’s a lot of action and movement in Iceland’s theatre life. It will be interesting to see what happens in the next few years.”
When the Band Began to Play
First, the strings enter: bowing a soft, high A. It’s the first ray of morning sunlight breaking over the horizon. The woodwinds answer with a two-note proclamation, like shadows retreating before the dawn. Like brilliant droplets of dew, glittering textures arise from the clarinets.
Take Me to Church
It’s a cold Sunday morning as I make my way up Skólavörðustígur towards the mighty Hallgrímskirkja church, a white, tapered structure that towers gracefully over downtown Reykjavík like a huge upside-down icicle. Very few people are out and about, and from the looks of it, most of them are tourists. None of them, however, look like they’re on their way to mass.
In Focus: Avalanche Barriers
On January 14, 2020, three large avalanches fell in quick succession in the Westfjords of Iceland. One avalanche fell in Súgandafjörður, directly across from Suðureyri, causing a tidal wave to strike the town that, ultimately, did little damage. The other two fell in Flateyri, causing more significant destruction. The timing of the avalanches was noteworthy. […]
Eggs in a Basket
On a mild spring night in Iceland, when the wind barely ruffles the hair on your head, it’s neither too hot nor too cold, and a soft light shines through the high clouds, driving around the Reykjanes peninsula is a magical experience. The spell is broken as soon as I turn on to the road to Krísuvíkurbjarg, however; the rocky trail to Southwest Iceland’s largest bird cliff is less travelled for a reason. But there’s no turning back now. At the end of the road, I have a meeting with members of the Hafnarfjörður Search and Rescue squad, who have been visiting the cliff every spring for decades. Their goal has always been the same, though their purpose has shifted.
When I finally get to the cliff, two large jeeps have already arrived, with a blur of activity around them. Long lines extend from one of the jeeps standing about 60m (200ft) from the cliff’s edge. At the other end of the line is a rescue squad volunteer in red overalls and a white helmet, with an orange pack around his waist. His name is Símon Halldórsson, and it’s hardly the first time he’s preparing to lower himself over the edge of this cliff. “I was 15 when I went over for the first time, and that was about 30 years ago,” he says as he signals the driver of the jeep that he’s ready to descend.
Daðis’s Eurovision is 20/20
The Eurovision Song Contest traces its origins to the end of the Second World War when the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) established a committee to unite the war-torn countries of Europe around a “light entertainment programme.” At a meeting in 1955, the journalist Sergio Pugliese suggested that the EBU host an international song contest in the vein of the Sanremo Music Festival in Italy, likewise established to revitalise the city’s economy and reputation in the wake of the war.
A year later, in 1956, the first Eurovision was held with seven participating countries. Today, it is the longest-running annual international television contest; one of the world’s most enduring television programmes period; and ranks among the most-watched non-sporting events in the world, with an estimated 100 to 600 million viewers annually.
Few people would oppose the noble ideal of peaceably uniting with one’s neighbours to forestall war, unless, of course, the very act of amicable assemblage could prove lethal. In Iceland, it would seem there could be no worse time to bring people together than on February 29, 2020 – the day after the first COVID-19 case was confirmed in the country.
It is a testament to the inevitable and irrational joy of Eurovision that it, despite all caveats, must always go on.

scientificamerican,https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/iceland-geothermal-power/ ,"REYKJAVIK, ICELAND—Snorri Sturlusson is the first name in geothermal development here. That's because this original Icelander tapped Earth's heat for a pool in his backyard, according to the medieval Icelandic Sagas. That pool, recently restored, still sits atop a grassy hill in the town of Reykholt. It's about 15 feet (4.5 meters) across, perfectly round, paved with gray and brown basalt tiles, and as warm to the touch as it was when Snorri built it almost a thousand years ago.
Sturlusson's modern-day descendants are striving to follow his example, especially the president, Ólafur Grímsson, who travels the world extolling the virtues of geothermal power. From the warm water that heats this capital city to the ""Blue Lagoon,"" Iceland is dotted with efforts to harness the volcanic power beneath its rugged and often stark surface.

Video: Iceland Geothermal Power
The island itself is basically a blister of porous basalt at the crack in Earth's crust where the North American and Eurasian plates are pulling apart. It possesses two of the traits dearest to geologists in search of exploitable geothermal power, according to power company Reykjavik Energy: enormous underground reservoirs of water that are continually renewed by levels of annual precipitation that range as high as 177 inches (450 centimeters) over Iceland's glaciers, and shallow plumes of magma that heat the deepest reaches of these reservoirs to temperatures in excess of 750 degrees Fahrenheit (400 degrees Celsius).
Plus, nowhere else other than the Great Rift Valley in Africa is seafloor spreading visible on land, says Richard Hey of the University of Hawaii. This constant generation of new crust makes the country one of the most geologically active on Earth. And it is that activity the Icelanders are trying to tap.
Home heat
Historically, Icelanders used Earth's heat directly for washing and baking the ""hot spring bread"" known as hverabrauth. In 1930 water from boreholes drilled into geothermal springs in Laugardalur, just east of the capital city of Reykjavik, was piped to Austurbaer primary school about two miles (three kilometers) away.
Whereas district heating in Iceland is straightforward—naturally pressurized ""low temperature"" geothermal fields containing potable water at temperatures less than 300 degrees F (150 degrees C) are common throughout the country, according to Reykjavik Energy, the regional power authority that includes Iceland's capital city—it wasn't until the first oil shock of the early 1970s that Icelanders got serious about exploiting their native energy resources. Ásgeir Margeirsson, CEO of Geysir Green Energy, says that at the time homes in Iceland were almost entirely dependent on oil heat.
By financing thermal and electric power plants throughout the country, as well as the infrastructure required to deliver hot water to homes, the Icelandic government not only eliminated the country's dependence on fossil fuels for heating and electricity, but also jump-started an entire industry, according to Alexander Richter, Director of Sustainable Energy, Global Research and Communication at Glitnir Bank.
Iceland is now the leading exporter of geothermal expertise to the rest of the world, according to the Trade Council of Iceland. The nation's engineers, geologists and financiers work on projects anywhere there are incentives (as in Germany, which has a feed-in tariff on geothermal of 20 cents per kilowatt-hour) or easily-tapped reservoirs of underground heat (as in the Philippines). Iceland's third-largest bank, Glitnir, helped finance the world's biggest geothermal district heating project in the city of Xianyang, China, and it retains a staff of geologists to evaluate the potential of early stage drilling projects, such as one it financed in Nevada, Richter says.
Today, Reykjavik is home to the largest district heating system in the world, and it has been estimated that were Icelanders still dependent on oil, their heating costs would be five times as high, according to Margeirsson. Across all of Iceland, 90 percent of households are connected to a district heating system, with just a few remote households getting their heat from fossil fuels such as propane.
Clean energy boom
Today, 99 percent of Iceland's electricity is produced from renewable sources, 30 percent of which is geothermal (the rest is from dams—and there are a lot of them), according to Iceland's National Energy Authority. When transportation, heating and production of electricity are considered as a whole, geothermal provides half of all the primary energy used in Iceland. (Although there are efforts underway to use the island's supplies of renewable energy to power its fishing fleet and motor vehicles through conversion to hydrogen fuel, these efforts are still at the earliest stages of development.)
For example, guests at the famous ""Blue Lagoon"" spa cannot help but notice the Nesjavellir geothermal power plant in the distance, whose plumes of steam tower over the turquoise outdoor pools from which the lagoon derives its name. Indeed, the lagoon would not exist without the plant, whose stream of used groundwater gradually clogged the porous rocks into which it had been flowing, forming the hot baths that are now Iceland's leading tourist attraction.
Yet only a small fraction of Iceland's geothermal capacity has been tapped. ""It's been estimated that by conventional use of geothermal, the available power in Iceland could be on the order of 20 to 30 terawatt-hours per year,"" says Ólafur Flóvez, general director of ÍSOR, or Iceland Geosurvey, the governmental institution that employs roughly 100 geologists to conduct research on geothermal resources. ""Currently we're producing maybe four terawatt-hours per year."" (A terawatt equals one trillion watts.)
Industry is already driving further development of Iceland's remaining geothermal resources. Aluminum smelting alone currently uses more electricity than all other activities in Iceland combined, and by 2015, 400 additional megawatts (million watts) of geothermal electricity are scheduled to go online just to serve a single new aluminum smelter in Bakki, in the north of the country, according to U.S.-based aluminum giant, Alcoa, which is investing heavily in the plant. Other industries are also looking to take advantage of this resource.
""It's no secret that both Microsoft and Google have looked at Iceland,"" Richter says. The enormous power needs of the clusters of powerful computers used to run the World Wide Web, known as data centers, have inspired companies to look for sites anywhere in the world there is cheap energy and sufficient connection to global networks.
The future is now
Not content to max out the country's geothermal potential using existing technologies, a consortium known as the Iceland Deep Drilling Project (IDDP), which includes the Icelandic government, the U.S. National Science Foundation, the European Union and Alcoa have banded together to tap an exotic and hard to exploit form of geothermal energy: supercritical steam.
When steam exceeds a certain temperature and pressure—in excess of 750 degrees F (400 degrees C) and 250 times greater than normal atmospheric pressure—the density of steam becomes identical to that of liquid water. This steam ""would yield five to 10 times as much energy per unit of volume extracted from the Earth,"" says Sverrir Thórhallsson, head of ÍSOR's engineering department.
Supercritical steam has already been used in coal-fired and nuclear power plants. The mechanism by which it yields higher efficiency is complicated, but ultimately it boils down to this: steam turbines need very hot steam in order to produce power, and supercritical steam is much closer to this temperature than cooler steam, says Ashok Malhotra, who literally wrote the book on the subject (Thermodynamic Properties of Supercritical Steam). As a result, very little energy is wasted in transferring heat from the steam that comes out of the ground to the steam that will spin the turbine. In addition, the entire system can be constructed under the assumption that steam and water don't have to be separated in the early phases of the power generating cycle—because at these temperatures and pressures, these usually distinct phases of water are literally one and the same.
Tapping supercritical steam will require drilling deeper than any geothermal project has ever drilled before; as deep as three miles (five kilometers) below the surface. No one knows exactly what the water will be like at that depth, according to Benedikt Steingrímsson, chief project manager of ÍSOR.
""We have already reach[ed] temperatures of 360 degrees C [680 degrees F] or more only at a depth of 2.2 kilometers [1.4 miles],"" Steingrímsson says. ""So we're already very close to the supercritical point. The heat is certain—how much fluid there is, what its chemical properties are, and its gas content are unknown.""
Dissolved solids, toxic metals and corrosive gases are only some of the obstacles the IDDP will have to overcome in the next 10 years—also at issue is the pressure of the supercritical fluid, which is 10 times greater than existing instruments and power plants have been designed to handle.
""Everyone knows it won't turn on lightbulbs anytime soon,"" Thórhallsson says. But surely Sturlusson, whose offspring still live in Iceland to this day, would have been proud. . ",False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False

newsweek,https://www.newsweek.com/environmental-effects-icelands-volcano-70371 https://www.newsweek.com/environmental-effects-icelands-volcano-70371 ,"The Environmental Effects of Iceland's Volcano
You don't need to have spent four nights in a European airport to know just how disruptive last week's eruption of the Icelandic volcano Eyjafjallajökull has been. Despite the global headache, there's a hint of good news. Climatologists who shudder whenever anything is expelled into the atmosphere can rest easy knowing that the atmospheric effects of Eyjafjallajökull won't linger, nor will the belching volcano have a sizable impact on global climate.
Initially, the environmental consequences will be severe. The contents of eruptions depend on location and geologic conditions, but all volcanoes spew skyward a mix of pulverized rock and glass, both of which can devastate ecosystems in the short term. The floating ash that has limited air travel will soon settle on Europe's fields and water systems and may have deadly consequences when ingested by livestock. The glass-and-rock mixture is fatal to most plant species since it prevents photosynthesis; as a result, greenery in Iceland and parts of northern Europe will have to fight to survive. But the effects don't last long. Within several months, the ash will simply blow away into the atmospheric background or fossilize to form new rock.
Then there's the gases. As the world scrambles to assess its output of greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change, could an unplanned eruption that lets loose carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping compounds derail the effort? The answer, in short, is no. ""Volcanoes don't emit that much carbon,"" says Cindy Werner, an analyst with the U.S. Geological Survey. ""And there won't be global effects of this particular eruption."" Compared to other volcanic events, Eyjafjallajökull is small potatoes and lingered in the news cycle only because of its location and effect on global economies. Each year in Alaska, as many as four eruptions of the same size or bigger occur. But with little human impact, attention to those blasts—if there is any—fades quickly.
That's because the planet is mostly equipped to deal with the gases that come out of volcanoes and has been for millions of years. It's the addition of skyrocketing emissions from human industrialization that normally concern climate scientists. On-the-ground estimates are still hazy in Iceland, but satellite images indicate that Eyjafjallajökull has emitted about 10,000 tons of carbon dioxide per day over the past week, a number roughly equal to the emissions of 2,000 cars per year. That's not insignificant, but compared to a bigger eruption, like Mt. Pinatubo in the Philippines in 1991, which spewed out 42 million tons over several months, Eyjafjallajökull is like a Tonka truck in a world of big rigs.
The bigger concern for climate researchers is sulfur dioxide, one of the prominent byproducts of volcanic eruptions. Because of its molecular structure, significant quantities of the compound can lead not to global warming but to global cooling. USGS researchers last year who analyzed the effects of three different Indonesian volcanoes over the past 200 years found that long after the ash and other particulate matter settle, which usually happens within days or weeks, increased levels of SO2 aerosols that migrate into the upper stratosphere actually deflect sunlight and heat rather than locking them in. Long term, serious global cooling could be even worse than warming, decimating the availability and quality of seeds worldwide and influencing mass extinctions. Eyjafjallajökull's aerosols will likely be rained out in the troposphere before they make it that high, but even output from the strongest eruptions settles within a few years, limiting lasting environmental impact.
Still, even without the threat of permanent harm, some environmentalists think Iceland could hold clues of similar and more frequent events to come. But in at least one way, Eyjafjallajökull may have been more helpful than harmful in the fight against climate change. ""There was more reduction in CO2 from airplanes not flying all week than in the amount that came from the volcano,"" says Alan Robock, an environmental scientist and volcanologist at Rutgers University. As it turns out, it wasn't a bad week for the environment after all. . The Environmental Effects of Iceland's Volcano

weforum,https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/11/why-iceland-ranks-first-gender-equality/ ,"For Icelanders, it is a source of pride to be the frontrunner in the World Economic Forum’s Global Gender Gap Index for the ninth year in a row. Ranking at the top is a confirmation of the successes achieved in recent decades and inspires us to continue to work towards complete equality of status, influence and power of men and women.
What is the secret to Iceland’s success? What are the lessons learned? In short, it is that gender equality does not come about of its own accord. It requires the collective action and solidarity of women human rights defenders, political will, and tools such as legislation, gender budgeting and quotas.
Iceland, despite being an island, is not isolated from progress towards gender equality. As is the case worldwide, our incremental progress can firstly be attributed to the solidarity of women human rights defenders challenging and protesting the monopoly of power in the hands of men and the power of men over women.
Secondly, the success can be attributed to women taking power and creating alternatives to the male dominant “truths” and making the invisible realities of women visible, most importantly discriminatory practices including sexual harassment and abuse. Lastly, Iceland’s progress can be attributed to women and men sharing power with each other as decision-makers and gradually having more men supporting the give and take of gender equality.
As such, the Icelandic case is nothing exceptional. It has been influenced by cultural, political, religious, social, academic and economic currents that have washed ashore and been domestically cultivated and created.
Culturally, there exists a notion of “strong women”. Despite being mythical, it has its roots in reality, as women enjoyed certain liberties and had cultural and religious authority during the commonwealth period that lingered on throughout the ages. On the religious front, diversity was embraced in the “pre-modern”, pagan society. There were gods and goddesses, as well as women and men serving as cultural and religious authorities. Women were priestesses and oracles, poets and rune masters, merchants and medicine doctors, enjoying respect in society.
This religious diversity ended with the advent of Christianity in the year 1000 when the diverse group of Gods and Goddesses was replaced by one monolithic God. At the same time, women were no longer deemed ""good enough"" to publicly represent God, and despite relatively equal status, women did not have the right to vote or to be represented in Iceland’s parliament – the oldest in the world, established in 930.
Women began to fight for the right to be good enough. They partly succeeded in 1914 and 1915 when women were granted the legal right to be Protestant priests, and the right to vote and run as political candidates, respectively. However, there was a huge gap between the progressive, rights-based law development and prevalent cultural norms and societal reality, which kept men in their place of power enjoying their “first-mover advantage” and continued to hold women back.
This situation remained until a critical mass of educated women penetrated the fortresses surrounding the palaces of knowledge, the academia, and feminism became a mass movement in the 1960s and 1970s, uniting women in their struggle for equal rights and influencing politics.
During these decades, women began to take power to define and redefine the world we live in and even invent new “truths” from where they were standing. Feminism began to infiltrate theology with God referred to as She by the first woman ever to be inaugurated as a priest in Iceland in 1974, or 974 years after Iceland became Christian and 60 years after it became legal for women to serve as priests. Thirty-eight years after that, in 2012, Iceland’s first female bishop was inaugurated. It had taken a century.
On the political front, women’s solidarity by means of political organising has been instrumental in promoting gender equality in Iceland. During the period from 1915 to 1983, only 2%-5% of members of Parliament were women.
It is also important to note that the first Icelandic women elected to a municipal government in 1908 and to parliament in 1922 were represented by women’s lists, not the traditional political parties. When this political experiment was repeated several decades later with the establishment of the Women’s Alliance in 1982, it led to major changes and a jump in women’s participation in politics. The political platform of the Women’s Alliance consisted of “women’s demands”, such as childcare for children to enable women to participate in the labour market on an equal footing with men, which were supported by female constituents.
Subsequently, in 1983, for the first time in Icelandic history, there was a sharp increase in the number of women in parliament jumping from five to 15 MPs of a total of 60 in a single election. An Icelandic political scientist, Dr Auður Styrkársdóttir, has compared the waves of women’s democratic enfranchisements with natural upheavals, such as earthquakes or volcanoes. Unlike the steady rise in women’s representation in the other Nordic countries, male dominance in Iceland was only broken by women’s collective action and solidarity.
The Women’s Alliance ceased to exist in 1999 after working relentlessly from inside parliament, influencing the political debate and the political agendas of the traditional political parties. Gradually, “women’s issues” were brought into the political agendas of other parties and women in these parties began to serve a more meaningful role than previously, when they were the icing on the cake, a decorative flower within male-dominated political parties and the lists of candidates.
During the century that has passed since women got national suffrage, there has been a rise in the number of women running as candidates for elections. Equal sex ratio is still not enough if the aim is to reach gender equality in political representation. To reach that aim, women have to be placed high(er) on the list of candidates to have an equal chance to be elected into power. One of the success stories in Iceland is that among the long-established political parties, only one party does not apply some kind of gender quota rules, such as a “zipper system” when selecting men and women on its lists of candidates.
In 2016, women accounted for 48% of elected representatives in parliament (since recent elections it has dropped to 38%). It is also a great achievement in this long struggle that the number of women in the cabinet has, in recent years, begun to reflect the share of women in parliament. The executive power has been referred to as the highest glass ceiling. After more than 100 years, there is almost political equality.
In conclusion, the status of women in Iceland was, historically, relatively equal to men even though legal equality was not ensured until 1976. Still, every woman is rendered vulnerable if she does not have or is stripped of real power by a system that does not de jure or de facto protect women’s rights vis-a-vis men in case of conflict. This applies in particular to situations of violence against women and girls perpetrated by family members or strangers within or outside their homes.
The life of a woman in a system that does not protect her human rights and security is like a Russian roulette: women are at the mercy of “their masters” – good or bad men – because the system protects the interests of (potential) perpetrators of violence. In such a system, some women are lucky while others draw or are handed the short straw.
Consequently, historically and still today, the struggle of women human rights defenders is not about good or bad men per se. Instead, it is all about use and abuse of power and authority, namely converting a system where a culture of impunity prevails over a culture of accountability for violence against women (and men).
The struggle is aimed at changing the system – the normative and the legal rules governing our lives – which has been shaped by people with and in power. This is also the reason why women need to have equal power and to be in power. Simple as that.
The systemic political and economic empowerment of women went hand in hand with the “invasion” of feminist scholars into the cradle of knowledge in the 1960s and 1970s, resulting in the emergence of a new reality that was previously unspoken and unseen. The term “sexual harassment” is a case in point. It was introduced in the 1960s, deriving its meaning from the experience of the so-far powerless and voiceless victims, the survivors, who were given a loudspeaker with this new feminist terminology.
Legislation prohibiting sexual harassment was introduced in Iceland as well as other predominantly western countries at the time. But the pervasive culture of male power and privilege meant that sexual predators continued to be protected despite the legal prohibition, by men and women alike, who were implicated in their crimes by either taking part by silencing the victims or by naming, blaming and shaming them.
Just before the allegations against Harvey Weinstein in the United States came to light, the Government of Iceland had collapsed after convicted sex offenders had their ""civil standing"" restored under legislation from the 19th century using the terminology “restoration of honour”. Information regarding the cases, originally withheld and later released, constituted a breach of trust in the minds of one of the smaller coalition partners, resulting in the dissolution of the government. In September, the respective clause in the law was repealed.
In general, it is impressive to see how social media is creating a wave of protest where women are speaking out, repeating #metoo and telling the world that they have had enough. This is happening in Iceland as it is elsewhere. The “business as usual” element of the “honour restoration cases” mobilised the survivors, their parents, feminists and the general public into a loud protest represented by the hashtag #höfumhátt, which means ""Let's not be silenced"".
Have you read?
What are the remaining challenges? In Iceland, as in the other Nordic countries, the welfare state is supportive of gender equality by granting parental leave to both parents resulting in not only more power sharing but also an increase in sharing of the responsibility for running a home and family. Ideas about masculinity are changing among young people which will most likely contribute to the elimination of gender segregation in the labour market in near future.
Still, there are challenges that remain to be resolved, not least the gendered reality we live in where so many things are assumed about individuals or groups on the basis of their sex, sexual orientation or identity. Such gendered assumptions and notions continue to cause problems such as how occupations predominantly held by women, such as nursing, are valued less than men’s occupations, such as construction. There is a gender pay gap for work of equal value despite the existence of a law on equal pay since 1961. Icelandic women have been protesting against this imbalance by going on general strike since 1975.
Now, more than 40 years later, equal rights are supported by political will, as evident in the introduction of the law on equal pay certification. This legislation is based on a tool called the Equal Pay Standard, which aims to eliminate the adjusted gender pay gap. The standard will apply to all companies and institutions with 25 full-time staff positions.
Implementing the standard will empower and enable employers to truly implement a management system of equal pay according to the principle of equal pay for equal work and work of equal value. They will thereby comply with the act on the equal status of men and women and fulfil the demands of international treaties, such as the International Labour Organization Conventions, the Beijing Platform of Action and the Convention to Eliminate All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW).
The intention of the government to implement the Equal Pay Standard through legislation was widely debated in Iceland, just as every other legislative measure on the matter has been. In turn it has brought the gender equality debate into mainstream politics and policy-making, away from the margins where it often resides.
It is believed that the Equal Pay Standard will be instrumental in eliminating the gender pay gap. What’s the secret? Walk the walk, don’t just talk the talk.

International development cooperation is an integral part of Iceland's foreign policy. The Strategy for International Development Cooperation focuses on the promotion of human rights and gender equality, peace and security, as well as the fight against poverty, social injustice, disparity in living conditions and hunger. It furthermore attempts to ensure internal coherence in Iceland's foreign policy with regards to global economic, environmental and security matters.
The overarching objective of Iceland's international development cooperation is to reduce poverty and hunger and promote general well-being on the basis of human rights, gender equality, and sustainable development.
Adhering to a professional, and systematic, approach is necessary for optimum outcomes and ensure that development cooperation renders sustainable results. It is also important that the allocation of ODA complies with strict requirements of transparency, efficiency and integrity. Iceland´s Policy for International Development Cooperation 2019-2023 stipulates focus areas and objectives, implementation, and efficiency and results.
Iceland’s development cooperation focuses on areas in which Iceland’s expert knowledge can be applied in the fight against poverty and in reaching the SDGs. Iceland actively contributes to combatting extreme poverty and hunger, and works to ensure that increased prosperity of communities benefits the poorest people and enhances equality. Special emphasis is on support to the most fragile and least developed states, as well as the promotion of peace at the international level. . Humanitarian Assistance
Iceland's humanitarian assistance is premised on safeguarding human lives, maintaining human dignity and reducing human suffering in crisis situations. In line with Good Humanitarian Donorship and commitments made at the World Humanitarian Summit in Istanbul 2016, Iceland recognises and adheres to the provision of principled and coordinated humanitarian action.
The need for humanitarian assistance has never been greater. This ever-growing need is a result of conflict and instability, climate change and economic hardship across the world. Millions of people are internally displaced or have had to flee their country of origin, which invariably results in great human suffering and a heightened risk of sexual and gender-based violence.
The Government of Iceland endeavours to alleviate the suffering of the most vulnerable in partnership with specialised UN agencies and funds mandated with coordinating and carrying out humanitarian action globally (OCHA, CERF, UNHCR and WFP). Collaboration is also in place between Iceland and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) through the Icelandic Red Cross. For more information on Iceland´s key humanitarian partners, please see below.
Iceland’s humanitarian assistance is needs-based with emphasis on predictable and flexible funding through multi-year framework agreements with priority partners as outlined in line Iceland´s policy for international development cooperation for 2019-2023.
Iceland also channels humanitarian funding through Civil Society Organisations that are registered in Iceland. Grants are advertised at least once a year in line with specific guidelines issued by the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. For more information, please see Civil Society and NGOs.
Humanitarian Assistance in 2019
Core contributions to Iceland’s key multilateral partners in humanitarian action were paid timely in accordance with existing multi-year framework agreements. Several framework agreements were revised and renewed. In terms of other core contributions, Iceland honoured its multi-year commitment with UNRWA, as well as all staff secondment related costs were paid. Further to this, the ICRC received an annual contractual contribution and all remaining agreements relating to humanitarian assistance were fulfilled.
Contributions in response to the protracted crisis in Syria and the serious consequences in neighbouring countries were substantive in 2019.The resource allocation was part of Iceland’s three-year pledge for 2018-2020 announced at the Syria Brussels Conference in 2018. Support went to UN agencies and humanitarian funds; OCHA Country Based Pooled Funds, WFP and UNHCR. Three of Iceland’s key UN partners in development cooperation were also included in the Syria pledge. These are UNFPA, UNICEF and UN Women who are carrying out humanitarian activities related to Syria. In addition, the Icelandic Red Cross and Icelandic Church Aid received Syria-related grants.
Calls for humanitarian funding for Yemen were regularly responded to throughout the year. Iceland contributed to the Yemen Humanitarian Response Plan led by the UN on more than one occasion. The funding went towards protecting women, adolescent girls and newborns across Yemen through support to UNFPA’s activities. Additional funding was pledged for UNFPA in Yemen at the Oslo Conference “Ending Sexual and Gender-based Violence in Humanitarian Crises”.
Iceland replied in early 2019 to UNHCR’s call for emergency assistance in support of refugees from Venezuela who fled to neighbouring countries. UNHCR also received a special unearmarked contribution towards their Global Appeal as part of Iceland’s pledges at the Global Refugee Forum in December in 2019.
WFP was supported in response to the post-flood emergencies in Mozambique and Malawi, both of which have been Iceland's partner countries in development cooperation for years.
ICRC’s special appeal to combat sexual violence in armed conflict was answered, and Iceland's contribution was directed towards South Sudan.
Finally, Iceland worked to strengthen the link between its humanitarian initiatives and development cooperation by embarking on a multi-year programme with UNICEF in Uganda on the development of water and sanitation in northern parts of the country. The focus of the programme is on addressing the needs of refugees from South Sudan and the host community.
Standby Partnership – experts on loan
Iceland has a Standby Partnership arrangement in place with a number of UN Agencies engaged in humanitarian action. Deployments range from three months to a maximum of one year. The number of deployments and types of assignments depend on the needs of the UN and Iceland‘s priorities. The selection of candidates is administered by the UN.
United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) plays a pivotal role in humanitarian action and emergency response worldwide and is one of Iceland‘s four priority multilateral humanitarian partners as outlined in Iceland‘s policy for international development cooperation for 2019-2023. OCHA‘s headquarters are split between New York and Geneva. There are five regional offices and thirty country offices.
Iceland contributes annual unearmarked funding to OCHA through a multi-year framework agreement. Multi-year agreements are the flagship of Iceland‘s humanitarian approach which centers on predictable and flexible resource allocation.
In addition, Iceland funds a number of OCHA Country Based Pooled Funds (CBPFs). The funds allow donors to pool their contributions into single, unearmarked funds to support local humanitarian efforts in crisis-affected countries in a timely, coordinated and principled manner. As such the funds, which are typically associated with the Grand Bargain, are a critical tool in bringing the decision-making closer to the beneficiaries, with the emphasis on the most vulnerable.
Monitoring and evaluation of projects funded through CBPFs is administerd by OCHA. This modus operandi has proven to be highly beneficial for a relatively small donor country like Iceland that has a limited physical presence in conflict-affected areas.
Iceland is a member of the OCHA Donor Support Group (ODSG). Iceland‘s membership is an important part of monitoring and assessing the work of OCHA and a way to measure the effectiveness of Iceland‘s ODA.
Iceland‘s partnership with OCHA extends beyond core funding and CBPFs. Namely, Iceland, in collaboration with the Icelandic Association for Search and Rescue (ICE-SAR) is part of the United Nations Disaster Assessment and Coordination (UNDAC) mechanism, which OCHA houses. UNDAC maintains a roster of trained professionals deployed to assess the situation during the first phase of a sudden-onset emergency and to assist in the coordination of incoming international relief at the national level and/or at the site of the emergency.
ICE-SAR, and Iceland by extension, is also a member of the International Search and Rescue Advisory Group (INSARAG), a global network of more than 90 countries and organisations under the UN umbrella that specialises in urban search and rescue (USAR) and methodology for international coordination in eartquake response. OCHA serves as the Secretariat.
The United Nations Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) is one of Iceland‘s four key multilateral partners in humanitarian action as outlined in Iceland‘s policy for international development cooperation for 2019-2023. The policy provides for increased and predictable contributions to humanitarian action. A multi-year framework agreement with CERF, depicting the annual provision of predictable funding, plays a crucial role in achieving said goal.
CERF is hosted under the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). The fund specialises in the provision of timely and reliable humanitarian and emergency assistance in conflict settings and following natural disasters. Emphasis is on early and effective measures to reduce suffering and save lives. The fund also plays a pivotal role in allocating resources to underfunded and forgotten crises.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) safeguards the rights and well-being of refugees and returnees, asylum-seekers, internally displaced and stateless people. One of the key functions of the agency is to provide protection, shelter as well as livelihoods and basic services to its beneficiaries. The UNHCR is headquartered in Geneva and operates in about 134 countries.
UNHCR is one of Iceland's four key multilateral partners in humanitarian action as per Iceland's policy for international development cooperation for 2019-2023. Iceland provides annual core funding to UNHCR in accordance with a multi-year framework agreement. Iceland's regular and unearmarked contributions provide the agency with the necessary flexibility and predicatability to prioritise and assist the most vulnerable at any given time.
Iceland is a member of the Executive Committee of the UNHCR (ExCom). The committee meets annually to review and approve the agency‘s programmes and budget and advise on international protection. Iceland‘s membership is an important measure to monitor and assess the work of the agency and to monitor the effectiveness of Iceland‘s ODA.
Iceland and UNHCR also work closely together on resettlement of refugees to Iceland. The resettlement programme is managed by the Ministry of Social Affairs.
The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) is one of Iceland‘s four key multilateral partners in humanitarian action. With WFP being dual mandated, the agency engages in both humanitarian and development assistance. WFP is headquartered in Rome and has regional and country offices in 83 countries.
Under the current multi-year framework agreement, Iceland provides predictable and core funding annually to WFP. Iceland also regularly responds to flash appeals with additional humanitarian funding. This is in line with Iceland's policy for international development cooperation for 2019-2023 which emphasises the provision of foreseeable and increasing contributions to humanitarian action.
The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) is responsible for providing essential services to Palestine refugees in the West Bank, Gaza, Lebanon, Syria and Jordan as per a UN General Assembly resolution.
UNRWA provides a wide range of services to Palestine refugees, not least in the fields of health and education, both inside and outside refugee camps. In addition, UNRWA has a more typical humanitarian and emergency role due to the war in Syria, the devastation in Lebanon and the protracted and complex situation in Gaza.
Iceland is a longstanding donor of the agency. The current arrangement is focused on financial contributions and seconded experts. Iceland entered into a multi-year framework agreement with UNRWA in 2018. The agreement stipulates foreseeable core contributions, which tallies with Iceland‘s policy on international development cooperation for 2019-2023.
The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) is an independent and impartial humanitarian organisation based in Geneva. The ICRC focuses on legal protection and assistance to victims of armed conflict under humanitarian law. In addition, the organisation advocates for the respect for and adherence to the Geneva Conventions.
International Humanitarian Law (IHL), administered by the ICRC, is the cornerstone for humanitarian action. Iceland therefore closely monitors the ICRC's work and provides the organisation with an annual financial contribution. Iceland also supports the ICRC through a framework agreement between the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and the Icelandic Red Cross.
For more information on the Ministry‘s collaboration with the Icelandic Red Cross, please see Civil Society and NGOs . Sustainable Whaling
Iceland attaches great importance to the principle of sustainable use of living marine resources as the sustainability of these resources is essential for the long-term prosperity of the country. Whaling in Icelandic waters is only directed at abundant whale stocks, North Atlantic common minke whales and fin whales, it is science-based, sustainable, strictly managed and in accordance with international law.
Several countries catch whales, including the United States, Russia, Canada, Norway, Japan, Greenland and Iceland. The whaling operations practiced by all those countries are legal and in accordance with the rules of the International Whaling Commission (IWC).
Iceland has always emphasised the need for careful conservation of marine resources and was one of the first countries in the world to take a conservationist approach to whaling. As signs of overexploitation of whales by foreign nationals emerged early in the last century, Iceland declared a ban on whaling for large whales around Iceland in 1915. Whaling was not resumed until 1948, except for limited catches from 1935 to 1939. Strict rules and limitations were applied to whaling in Iceland from 1948 to 1985 when commercial whaling was halted again following a decision by the IWC. Limited catch for scientific research was taken during the following years in accordance with the provisions of the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling (IWC Convention), but commercial whaling was resumed in 2006.
According to a regulation issued in 2019, sustainable catch limits for common minke whales and fin whales follow the advice given by the Marine Research and Freshwater Institute of Iceland. The advice for the 2019-2023 season is for maximum annual catch of 217 common minke whales and 161 fin whales, respectively.
The abundance of both common minke whales and fin whales has been confirmed by the Scientific Committees of the IWC and the North Atlantic Marine Mammal Commission (NAMMCO), as can been seen on their respective websites (www.iwc.int and nammco.no). According to recent whale surveys, there are around 50,000 common minke whales in the area around Iceland (Central North Atlantic) and approximately 33,500 of fin whales in the East Greenland-Iceland stock area. The recommended catch limits of both species (0.4-0.5% per year) are well within the generally accepted values for sustainable catch rates of whale stocks. It should be noted that neither of the two species harvested by Iceland qualify for any of the IUCN threatened categories (“critically endangered”, “endangered” or “vulnerable”) in the most recent regional assessment for North Atlantic cetacean populations (www.iucnredlist.org/initiatives/europe). According to the Icelandic national redlist issued by the Institute of National History in 2018, fin whale in Icelandic waters are classified as ""Least Concern"" (LC).
On the IUCN global list fin whales are assessed as „vulnerable (VU)“ and common minke whales as least concern (LC). The global classification of fin whales is primarly due to poor status of the Southern Hemisphere subspecies of fin whales while it is clearly recognised that fin whale populations in the North Atlantic are in much better condition.
Iceland is an advocate of international cooperation in ensuring conservation and sustainable use of living marine resources, including whales. This has been the position taken by Iceland within the IWC, based on the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling . The stated role of the IWC, according to its founding Convention, is to “provide for the proper conservation of whale stocks and thus make possible the orderly development of the whaling industry”.
- For information on various scientific research projects on whales and other marine mammals in the North Atlantic, please refer to the websites of the Marine Research Institute of Iceland,www.hafro.is, and the North Atlantic Marine Mammal Commission,www.nammco.no. . Tourism in Iceland
Tourism has in recent years become one of the main pillars of the Icelandic economy. The Department of Tourism at the Ministry of Industries and Innovation is responsible for developing and executing an official tourism policy, proposing legislation in the field of tourism and co-ordinating the work of various governmental bodies with regard to tourism issues.
The Icelandic Tourist Board, the Tourist Site Protection Fund, The Route Development Fund and the Tourism Task Force are bodies that operate under the auspices of the Ministry. The Ministry also works in close co-operation with various other Ministries when it comes to matters that affect tourism.
The Ministry has several agreements with Business Iceland regarding the promotion and marketing of Iceland in general and specifically as a tourism destination.

Conservation of the environment is a high priority for Iceland, a country that depends on natural resources and their sustainable management. Given the economy's high dependence on fisheries and exports of seafood, the sustainable harvesting of living marine resources is an economic as well as an environmental priority. A quota system in fisheries, limiting the total allowable catch at a level deemed sustainable by marine scientists, is showing signs of paying off.
On the global agenda, Iceland has been a strong voice in the fight against the pollution of the oceans. Icelandic waters are among the cleanest in the world. Iceland has taken an active role in international fora on the issue of peristant organic pollutants.
Although Iceland is famous for its unspoiled natural beauty, there are areas where care must be exercised. One of the most serious environmental problems in Iceland is the loss of vegetation by wind erosion. The Icelandic Soil Conservation Service has been fighting soil erosion since 1907 with considerable success. It currently aims at revegetating sites with a total area amounting to more than 2% of the country's land area. However, the fight to halt and reverse the erosion and desertification and to advance land reclamation, will remain one of Iceland's priorities in the environmental field in coming years and decades.
Nature conservation in general is of increasing concern. Iceland has some of the few remaining large wilderness areas in Europe, and their natural features are in many ways unique. Development pressures from tourism and energy production (hydroelectric and geothermal) on wilderness areas are increasing, which calls for improved planning to reconcile nature conservation and the continuing development of Iceland's abundant clean and renewable energy sources. .

Nature & Environment
From a geological standpoint, Iceland is a very young country, still in the midst of its own creation. Shaped by the forces of nature, the, barren landscapes demonstrate the creativity powers of the four basic elements—earth, air, fire, and water—in a dramatic way. Active volcanoes, bright green valleys, glacier-cut fjords, black sand beaches, and roaring rivers are the most distinctive features of the Icelandic landscape. And although they are very accessible, they still remain virtually untouched by human civilization. In a fast-paced world of sprawling development, Iceland's pure nature and empty expanses stand out as a luxury.
Despite the name, “ice” only covers about 10% of the land, but still represents the largest glaciers left in Europe. It represents a source of pure water and symbolizes the purity of Icelandic products. Icelanders are proud of their close ties to nature, and dedicated to preserving this natural wealth through responsible conservation. According to the Environmental Performance Index, created by the World Economic Forum in 2012, Iceland is the world's greenest country. Iceland is at the forefront of renewable energy production, and nearly every home in the country is supplied with heating and energy from renewable energy sources.
Iceland has also made a commitment to responsible fisheries management, and incentive programs to reduce fossil fuel-driven transportation through the use of hydrogen and methane. . What it’s all about
For nearly 50 years, Iceland has been driven by a commitment to Doing it Right:
- Caring for our planet by leading initiatives to enhance the global environment
- Supporting the communities we serve both by paying our taxes and through our Charitable Foundation
- Selling quality food that is also great value
- Working with our suppliers to build mutually beneficial long term partnerships
- Valuing our people as a true family business, recognised as one of the Best Big Companies to Work For in the UK.
These principles are embedded throughout our business and drive every decision of our board. . Ministry for the Environment and Natural Resources

Iceland often ranks near the top of lists of the healthiest nations in the world. The UK's Channel 4 went on a quest around the globe to find the world's healthiest diet, and Iceland, with its focus on fish and its healthy dairy products, was crowned the winner.
Life expectancy in Iceland is very high and men's life expectancy is, in fact, the highest in the world, at 81 years. Women still live longer, with an expectancy of 84.
But what is it that makes the Icelandic nation so healthy? Is it just the food? Or is it to do with a wealth of contributing factors that only can only be found on this little island?
This nation is dotted with springs, rivers, waterfalls, glaciers and hot springs. The water in Iceland is plentiful and some of the cleanest in the world.
The cold tap water you get in Iceland is the same as that which runs through landscape, and that is bottled and sold (so help save your money and the planet by never buying it). Just make sure that you run the tap for a little while before drinking the cold water, as the hot water also comes straight from the ground and tastes like sulphur. While safe, it is also rather unpleasant.
The hot, volcanic water used to warm up houses is pumped from variety of hot springs all around the country. People have used these hot springs for centuries to bathe, wash clothes and cook in, and it has long been thought that the natural hot water and the many minerals in it do wonders for people’s health.
This is claimed to be the case at many pools in the country; the silica mud in the Blue Lagoon, for example, helps some people with psoriasis and other skin diseases greatly.

As mentioned above, the Icelandic diet is one of the healthiest in the world. Icelandic food ingredients are very wholesome, and largely organic and free-range. The country is a fishing nation and people eat a lot of fresh and dried fish, either from the sea or caught wild in the rivers. The Icelandic rivers have a lot of salmon and trout and there are a variety of fishing tours you can choose from if you’d like to catch your own.
Iceland is also famous for its lamb. There are roughly a million sheep living in Iceland, three times the human population. The sheep roam around freely throughout the summer in the countryside, so the meat is organic and free-range. Somewhat morbidly, they add to their flavour by grazing on thyme and other herbs, seasoning themselves.

Up until recently it wasn’t possible to grow much variety of fruit and vegetables in the country but that’s all changed with geothermal greenhouses. Hveragerði is the greenhouse capital of the country and you’ll see them all over the South Coast of Iceland, growing herbs, tomatoes, cucumbers, lettuce, and even bananas, amongst many other things.
In recent years, Icelanders have also become very concerned about eating healthily, with a number of athletes promoting healthy options and the raw food chain Gló opening up a number of restaurants in Reykjavík. Additionally, vegans and vegetarians have a number of healthy options for dining out, as well as some not-so-healthy choices.
There are a number of sports and activities that are practiced in Iceland, the most enjoyed by visitors probably being hiking. The nature of the country is spectacularly beautiful but often not very accessible by a car. Therefore the country is decorated with hiking routes all over, leading you to waterfalls, valleys, fjords and the Highlands.
Running is also popular, especially around the Reykjavík Marathon that takes place every August, on the same day as Culture Night in Reykjavík.
Horseback riding is another beloved activity, both among the locals and tourists, as the Icelandic horse is famous for having an extra gait and for being sturdy and friendly.
Yoga is also gaining popularity in the country. Yoga is often associated with a healthy lifestyle and being at one with nature, so it’s not surprising that today you can join a yoga tour on a black-sand beach.
Often a certain sport is ‘trending’ in Iceland, and at the moment that sport seems to be CrossFit; we currently have two female world champions, Katrín Tanja Davíðsdóttir and Annie Mist Þórisdóttir.
Iceland also has a number of strong men champions, such as Jón Páll Sigmarsson and Magnús Ver Magnússon. Currently Hafþór Júlíus Hafsteinsson is Iceland’s strongest man – although he’s perhaps more famous for playing the Mountain at Game of Thrones. And Gunnar Nelson is an MMA fighter in the UFC.
Football is increasingly popular, Iceland coming in the quarter-finals in the last European Cup, and now being the smallest country ever to qualify for the World Cup; women's football is also very popular out here, and the team has enjoyed a similar string of recent success.
Before football, the country's main ball-sport was handball. Iceland only has a population of 330,000 people but still somehow managed to place second in it at the 2008 Olympics.
Perhaps the most popular sport in of all Iceland is swimming, although not necessarily professionally. There are plenty of swimming pools in Reykjavík and swimming pools around Iceland, both indoor and outdoor, almost always including at least one hot tub and often sporting a sauna as well.
Other watersports include river rafting, kayaking, snorkelling and diving. Iceland actually has one of the best dive sites in the world, Silfra, where the visibility can be exceed 100 metres.
Perhaps it comes as a surprise to some, but skiing isn’t a massively large sport in Iceland as the ski-season can’t be depended upon. It simply does not snow heavily or regularly enough, contrary to popular belief.
Ski slopes are, however, dotted around the country, and very cheap if compared to international ski resorts. A day pass is 3,250 ISK and a season pass is 29,500 ISK at the Reykjavík ski areas, Bláfjöll and Skálafell. There aren't many famous skiers from Iceland, but the snowboarder Halldór Helgason has earned his name in the international snowboard community.
Glacier hiking and ice climbing may seem to be associated with winter, but are actually accessible all year round in Iceland as they take place on the country's many glaciers. It's only during wintertime though that you can go to a natural ice cave as you see on the picture above.
A lot of factors come in when deciding the health of a nation. Iceland particularly performs well in many of the factors that are related to wellbeing.
The Icelandic air is very clean and there's very low pollution in Iceland. The population is very small but the country is comparatively large, meaning there is a community spirit but everyone has quite a bit of space.
Equal rights are strongly fought for, and the gender gap is the smallest in the world; discrimination on the basis of sexuality, race, religion or other facts is challenged from almost all sectors of society. Crime is rare, tensions few, literacy high, and public discourse is largely civil.
Overall, these facts help Icelandic people feel safe and happy. Combined with the factors listed above, it is little wonder that Iceland is considered one of the healthiest places in the world to live. . Top things to do in Iceland

What are the main differences between sustainable tourism and mass tourism in Iceland? What are the positive and negative effects of the tourism boom and what can Icelanders learn from the experiences of other countries? What can you do to make sure your visit to Iceland is both respectful and authentic?
Ever since the 2010 eruption of the immense, ice-capped volcano, Eyjafjallajökull, the eyes of the world have been fixated on Iceland, a country whose stark and mystic beauty had long been a well-kept secret.
With air travel interrupted, holidays cancelled and an enormous plume of Icelandic ash making its way across the skies of Europe, that secret was suddenly, and violently, out of the bag. The country would never be the same again.
In the period since, the country has seen an unprecedented rise in visitor numbers—a trend that has uprooted and revolutionised the very foundations of Icelandic culture. But just how enormous is this tourism boom?
In 2016, Keflavik Airport saw a 40% increase in guests from the preceding year—roughly 1,700,000 people visited the island nation of 330,000—demonstrating how fundamental the tourism industry has become to the country's economy.
On average, foreign tourism grew by an average of 21.6% from 2010 to 2015. In that same period, overall foreign exchange earnings from tourism grew from 18.8% to 31%, coinciding with the tourism overtaking aluminium processing and fishing to become the country's largest industry.
Within five years, visitation to Iceland had increased by a staggering 264%—and with numbers like that, it's difficult at best to predict how such a trend can stop in the foreseeable future.

Yet, tourists, in general, are notorious for changing the very dynamics of a country that made it so desirable to them in the first place. This is often classified by industry professionals as ""overtourism."" This problem is not specific to Iceland, but global in nature and affecting many other countries.
To take one example from this year, protests were held in Spain against what Spaniards saw as a loss of control by the country’s tourism board. The banners read simply: “THIS IS NOT TOURISM, IT IS AN INVASION""—Spain, like Iceland, also felt the benefits of a tourism boom during the 1970s when the industry bailed out the country’s economy so efficiently that the period has since been labelled “The Spanish Miracle”.
Experience tells us that a surge in tourism will have both positive and negative impacts on the host country, and the perspective one adopts depends largely on which sphere of influence one chooses to focus one's attention on.
For instance, one side of the argument could rightly contend that tourism has been—and continues to be—the saving grace of the Icelandic economy; an economy that totally collapsed following the 2008 financial crisis. No one could dispute this fact, nor would they even try.
And yet, many sites of cultural and historical significance are now routinely overrun by eager sightseers, threatening both nature’s delicate balance and the potential for future preservation. In this respect, both the Icelandic government and its people have yet to find an equilibrium between financial gain and physical loss; the tourism debate continues to rage on while the country sits at a crossroads.
Despite the breadth of the challenges Iceland now faces, very few policy changes have been made over recent years to help alleviate the issue. Even those who have profited the most from Iceland's tourism boom have been quick to chastise the government's slow response to such tribulations.
For instance, the Icelandic government neither taxes the visitors flying into the country, nor has it set up any toll roads along major tourist routes. The money earned from such ventures could go a long way toward securing needed infrastructure development and environmental preservation and yet this option remains unexplored.
The changes being made are short term and imposed only to settle the immediate frustrations of an anxious population. For example, tour buses are now no longer able to access Reykjavik's central streets, given complaints from downtown residents that the tourist shuttles clog the streets, obstruct traffic and hamper pedestrian walkways. While this is a positive step, nothing much is done to consider curbing the exponential long-term increase of such operators.
There have also been adjustments to the accommodation situation; landlords renting out their property as an Airbnb now have a 90-day cap, a proposition that, hopefully, should curb the exile of young people and artists from the 101 downtown neighbourhood. Such legislation is but an afterthought aimed to rectify the problems tourism has already brought to Iceland's shores.
There is a particularly vocal opposition in Iceland who refutes such changes, claiming the legislation to be the equivalent of picking a weed from its flower rather than its roots; the problems will reoccur again and again until decisive action is taken.
Some claim that the solution can only be in the form of a yearly cap on visitors, that by heavily regulating the industry will offer the country some breathing room in order to improve its infrastructure. Others claim that such a disruption to the current equilibrium could harm Iceland's attractiveness to tourists in the future.
Icelanders are renowned for their openness, friendly attitude and authentic interest in those outsiders visiting their shores. They are also an incredibly proud people, loyal to their heritage, their island and their kinship with one another. No one should be under the illusions that Icelanders want their country to be perceived as the ""Nordic Disneyland"", and efforts should be made to not treat the place as such.
Patience as a virtue is something this country's people have cherished for centuries, but as the pressure mounts internally, one can't help but think back on that Spanish protest banner, ""This is not tourism, it is an invasion!"" To put it simply, over time, the Icelanders' patience will wear thin; already, the cracks are beginning to show through their well-set stoicism.
There is something of a dichotomy in the Icelandic press on this issue. Take ""the toilet issue"" as a prime example; the city's English language newspaper, The Reykjavik Grapevine, happily exposes tourists defecating on private property around Iceland, whilst mentioning in only quiet passing the fact that many of Iceland's more distant attractions lack any utilities whatsoever (...let's leave them to go in their pants, shall we? Welcome to Iceland).
Tourism is an industry like any other, working off proven models, systems and theories in order to generate the largest profit margin possible. The increasingly complex network of stakeholders in this massive operation include government parties, airlines, tourism operators, tour providers, local businesses, real estate holders, local residents and of course, the tourists themselves.
On a global scale, the industry has been broken down into an enormous array of specific terms, each pointing to a different ‘pull’ the tourist desires; eco-tourism, creative tourism, dark tourism, space tourism, religious tourism, volunteer tourism, to name only a handful.
In Iceland, the largest attraction is the nature itself, as well as the chance to experience unblemished, human solitude in wide open landscapes. This would be categorised as Nature / Adventure Tourism.
As a caveat to this point, let it be mentioned that ""Nature Tourism"" means that Nature itself is the primary engine for Iceland's travel industry, and therefore, of the utmost importance when it comes to protection and respect. The danger, of course, is that through overtourism, we end up destroying what we love the most.
The two most important models today are ‘Sustainable Tourism’ and ‘Mass Tourism’. Sustainable tourism is the future, a means of protecting the industry, the environment and ourselves. Mass tourism is the model of yesteryear, an economic turkey shoot whose priorities lie not in conservation or continuation of the practise, but simply in the increase of profits all costs.
Overall, sustainable tourism can be defined as a management strategy for attracting international visitors, taking into full account the consequences such action will have on the environment, the host culture and its economy. Thus, in order to fully achieve this ambition, sustainable tourism practitioners should:
There are three key areas that Icelanders themselves have identified as areas of concern for the future; economic and social impacts on the culture of native Icelanders, a lacking transportation infrastructure and the need for swift environment preservation. Even the director general of the Icelandic Tourist Board, Ólöf Ýrr Atladóttir, has since claimed, "" in hindsight, we should have focused on infrastructure at the same time"".
The overall outlook described above differs dramatically from mass tourism, a term academics have coined to describe the outdated model the sector currently works under in many parts of the world.
To give you a tangible idea of mass tourism, consider the presence of cruise liners, theme parks, resort towns and package vacations. Mass tourism caters to those who have done little to no background reading or language preparation, as well as to those who are seeking out only ""the most popular sights"". But what is the underlying process that makes mass tourism tick?
For starters, mass tourism relies on sights and activities being commodified and sold as products. This, quite obviously, does much to deter the idea that the sights and activities in question are marketed as a “once in a lifetime experience."" And yet, this is but a mere consequence of a greater number of people travelling for pleasure; the system is designed to acquire and cater to as many guests as possible.
This problem is further irritated by the fierce competition between operators. By waging pricing wars, the difference between travel services becomes minimal at best. This means that, rather than being offered a truly unique experience, visitors to Iceland will be met with the same tours and activities that already saturate the market.
As tourist numbers increase, so too does the local ambition to profit off this trend; in today's Iceland, tour operators rise and fall like card stacks, with even the largest companies at risk due to their reliance on the market factors.
This oversaturation is a problem partly created by the tourists themselves. By acknowledging and readily accepting the sheer amount of discount pricing going on, many consider cheap travel a right rather than a privilege. Such thinking can only be of detriment to a quality experience.
It should also be considered that tourism is a perishable industry, reliant on the transient tides of international interest, and therefore cannot be stocked in the same way as other major industries.
Considering that visitors travel to Iceland for its magnificent nature—its cascading waterfalls, its unbound wild lands, its delicate river systems, its snow-wreathed mountains—it would seem obvious that ecological care and protection is fundamental to ensuring the tourism industry's prolonged lifespan.
Iceland’s resident glaciers are a major pull for international visitors travelling to the country, yet many will overlook the fact that these very ice-caps are directly affected by changes in climate and are receding at a measurable rate. When the glaciers disappear, so too will a plethora of related activities, tour options and, most importantly, beautiful natural panoramas.
As the gatekeepers to Iceland, airline companies must share their brunt of the responsibility. Despite the fact that travelling to Iceland via alternative options is largely unpractical, it must not be overlooked that the airline industry has, for decades, fought legislative action to combat carbon-related climate change. In doing so, airlines have directly opposed the principles they claim to hold so dear.
Of course, given the large profits raked in each year by airlines, their ability to mask their true colours and deceive the consumer into buying into their eco-friendly image is a force of nature in its own right. Responsible tourists are able to detect this hypocrisy easily, and thus, should take the matter into account when planning their trip.
In truth, it is unlikely that Iceland will see the visitor numbers currently projected by the government in future years. According to these predictions, some 2.5 million guests are expected to visit Iceland in 2018, but as elsewhere, the novelty of a destination tends to wear off in time.
With that being said, Iceland’s boom is unexampled, in major part due to the country’s small population. Only very tenuous links can be drawn with other nations experiencing their own tourism booms.
Circulating in Iceland are a number of theories on how to ensure the industry’s proliferation. As mentioned above, on one side of the argument there is a call to temporarily cap the number of visitors to the country every year. This way, government agencies would have the respite needed to improve and invest in Iceland’s infrastructure, its road systems and site accessibility.
Though it sounds like a long shot and starkly in contention with the onslaught of tourist money, Iceland has prepared itself for the long-term in such ways before. Consider the fishing quotas implemented in the 1980s; without such strict regulation, Iceland's fish stocks would not be at the sustainable levels we see and cherish today.
The government has already set out its plans to place nature conservation and outdoor activities hand in hand. As set out in Outdoor Activities in Harmony of Nature, the objectives prior to 2020 are as follows;
To achieve these ambitions, the government is focusing their attention on a handful of important areas; an individual's right to travel, the carrying capacity of tourists sites, site improvements, increased patrols, more information provided to tourists and an active tourist participation in monitoring costs.
All in all, Iceland is a small country with a small population and a parliament that only has space for 63 members. In light of such facts, the country should be able to pull together to collectively make tourism a force for good in Iceland and not one that will continue to pressure the population indefinitely.
Having survived and prospered a 2008 banking crisis, a housing market collapse, a devalued currency and a peak in unemployment, overtourism is just one more hurdle for the Icelandic people to overcome. Be under no illusion, however; to do so will take the participation and cooperation of numerous agencies: government officials, airlines, tourist boards, tour operators and YOU.
There are a number of ways in which the tourists themselves can contribute to sustainable tourism practices. First and foremost it is imperative that you do some prior reading on the culture you would like to visit. Learning about the environment in which you will be travelling helps to put you in a respectful frame of mind and will also inform you about some basic mistakes you can avoid.
Acting responsibly during your visit to Iceland will also help to maximise your time and experience. By reflecting on how the locals interact with one another and their environment, you'll find yourself fitting seamlessly into the fabric of Icelandic culture.
One of the first observations visitors to Iceland often make is how clean the nation’s streets and countryside are. Although other cultures might have a more nonchalant attitude to littering, Icelanders are incredibly proud, diligent and proactive when it comes to keeping their environment clean.
Litter bins are prevalent on almost every street corner of downtown, ensuring that there is always a better spot for that empty can of coke than the neighbouring bushes.
One of the greatest dangers is the exponential rate in which littering occurs. If one is strolling down an unblemished street, then one is far more likely to contemplate being the first individual to tarnish it with their laziness.
On the other hand, if the street were already to look as though it is habitually used as a passing rubbish dump, one is immediately inclined to care less about its active protection.
In truth, respecting the environment does not just mean refraining from littering, it means taking a proactive approach to the problems that already exist. If during your time here you happen to stumble across litter that can be easily removed, we implore you to do so.
After all, we as a species must evolve past our sense of entitlement and belonging, and instead, strive to better ourselves and the environment whenever the opportunity to do so arises.
Whilst travelling in Iceland, keep conscious of the environmental regulations that are in place to preserve and protect the country's nature. Off-road driving, for instance, is illegal given the impact and irreversible damage that such action causes to Iceland's fragile environment. To find safe routes and road conditions, one can check the Icelandic Road and Coastal Administration's English website here.
So too is treading off designated hiking trails and paths; remember, much of Iceland is covered with a delicate blanket of moss, a particular species that takes many years to recover if damaged. Because of this, camping on private property outside of designated campsites is illegal. If you seek permission from the landowner, however, they may be happy to grant you access for a small fee.
One surefire way of supporting the Icelandic economy is to favour local businesses. By purchasing local goods and cuisine, and seeking out those companies who prioritise environmental causes, you will be making a direct impact on the longevity of Iceland as a must-visit destination.
Supporting the local business also allows you to come in direct communication with Icelandic people; by engaging this way, you will gain a deeper insight into the nature of daily life here and see for yourself the incredible talent, commitment and entrepreneurship demonstrated by the Icelandic small-business community.
For those who live in Reykjavik, it is never long until a conversation regarding Airbnbs crops up. Due to the tourist boom and a natural, human desire to make the best out of a situation, a large number of Icelandic landlords have striven to use their properties as pop-up Bed and Breakfasts. In doing so, they have alleviated the pressure on tourist accommodation, making it possible for the country to handle so many people.
In truth, when it comes to accommodation, Iceland is stuck between a rock and a hard place. Given that a hotel construction project will often take a few years to complete, the need for accommodation in the meanwhile has caused an inordinate amount of stress for locals and travellers alike.
As simple arithmetic would have it, renting to tourists is far more profitable than renting to locals; unfortunately, this means a great number of downtown residents have been evicted from their homes and forced to live further away from the city centre.
From 1st January 2017, new legislation was implemented regulating the spread of Airbnbs in Reykjavik. Property owners have 90 days of the year to rent out their rooms and apartments to tourists, or until they have acquired 2000,000 ISK in gross rental income. Property owners who intend to do this will have to first register with the police, pay a fee and provide all information relating to rental days, income and expenses.
Critics of this legislation pose a number of interesting points, highlighting the sheer complexity of the issue. Many point to Iceland's small police force, claiming they have neither the manpower nor resources to prosecute those who violate such terms.
It is expected that entrepreneurial Icelanders will continue the practise, all the while hedging their bets they won't be discovered. On top of that, it is highly conceivable that the new legislation is not really about protecting city residents, but instead Iceland's hotel industry during the winter months, the time when occupancy is at its lowest.
Unless you happen to reside in a country where clean drinking water is very much in short supply, there should be no reason, ever, to purchase and consume bottled water.
Quite frankly, there is no country on the planet where water is quite so fresh, natural and drinkable. Aside from the reality that there is absolutely no need to spend money on water that's exactly the same as that from the tap, plastic bottles cause an enormous level of damage to Iceland's ecosystem, be it in the surrounding coastal waters or inland.
The consumption of puffin and whale meat has long been a part of Icelandic culture, the people utilising the resources available to them to survive the hardships of this inhospitable, volcanic island. The Icelandic word ""hvalreki"" means ""beached whale"", a description of something positive that is unexpectedly at someone's disposal.
Whilst now considered a delicacy by certain Icelanders, others across the country are itching to fight this practice, especially wildlife operators who rely on puffin and whale watching as their livelihood. In the spirit of sustainability, experiencing such domestic wildlife from a distance is always a preferable option, especially considering that puffins were recently added to the Endangered Species list.
Although tourism is not the primary, driving factor for Iceland's whaling or hunting quota—the whaling quota is, for now, at least sustainable—it overlays the practice with an unnecessary justification, thus complicating the environmental and sustainability argument further.
Trying such exotic meats as whale and puffin have become a novelty for visitors arriving in the country, with many restaurants along Laugavegur advertising such products for sale. The reason why WHALE and PUFFIN are written in such large and bold lettering is to attract those who have never eaten it, nor had any prior inclination to do so. Guide to Iceland does not support the practice of whaling.
Now, given the international assertion that whaling is an outdated practise, this country's hunting of Minke Whales does little for Iceland's economy and even less for its reputation abroad. When it comes to arguments of tradition, the country must be honest with itself as to which traditions should be kept alive and which should be buried for good.

Without a measure of a doubt, tour guides are the frontline troops of Iceland’s tourist industry. Braving the island’s capricious weather, its disobedient terrain and an onslaught of underprepared visitors, they are, arguably, the herring fishermen of today’s economy, keeping the country and its guests in a constant state of security.
Be they whale watchers, super jeep drivers, scuba divers, hikers or cavers, you can guarantee there is a guide out there now, somewhere in the wilderness, working. With that in mind, one should always respect the experience and knowledge that such guides boast. This is, after all, their shooting ground, their land and their life, devoted to the guest and the activity at hand.
It goes without saying then that guides are an indispensable asset to the country’s workforce. Without foreign visitation, the boom in development, culture and industry here would simply be non-existent.
This is why, without much complaint, the idea that ""guides don't expect tips"" in Iceland slowly gnaws away at the mental well-being of many guides. Without a measure of a doubt, for the work done, their job is underpaid, physically demanding and encapsulates numerous challenges, least of all keeping a smile plastered on their faces when things get tricky.
Given the tipping culture of many of those travelling to Iceland, handing out a little extra is NEVER frowned upon, nor is it completely unexpected.
Last, but not least, you'd do well to do some background reading on Iceland before you arrive. Below you will find a number of background articles that might be of particular use to the conventional traveller to Iceland.

What are the main differences between sustainable tourism and mass tourism in Iceland? What are the positive and negative effects of the tourism boom and what can Icelanders learn from the experiences of other countries? What can you do to make sure your visit to Iceland is both respectful and authentic?

Yet, tourists, in general, are notorious for changing the very dynamics of a country that made it so desirable to them in the first place. This is often classified by industry professionals as ""overtourism."" This problem is not specific to Iceland, but global in nature and affecting many other countries.
To take one example from this year, protests were held in Spain against what Spaniards saw as a loss of control by the country’s tourism board.

This means that, rather than being offered a truly unique experience, visitors to Iceland will be met with the same tours and activities that already saturate the market.
As tourist numbers increase, so too does the local ambition to profit off this trend; in today's Iceland, tour operators rise and fall like card stacks, with even the largest companies at risk due to their reliance on the market factors.
This oversaturation is a problem partly created by the tourists themselves. By acknowledging and readily accepting the sheer amount of discount pricing going on, many consider cheap travel a right rather than a privilege. Such thinking can only be of detriment to a quality experience.
It should also be considered that tourism is a perishable industry, reliant on the transient tides of international interest, and therefore cannot be stocked in the same way as other major industries.
Considering that visitors travel to Iceland for its magnificent nature—its cascading waterfalls, its unbound wild lands, its delicate river systems, its snow-wreathed mountains—it would seem obvious that ecological care and protection is fundamental to ensuring the tourism industry's prolonged lifespan.
Iceland’s resident glaciers are a major pull for international visitors travelling to the country, yet many will overlook the fact that these very ice-caps are directly affected by changes in climate and are receding at a measurable rate. When the glaciers disappear, so too will a plethora of related activities, tour options and, most importantly, beautiful natural panoramas.
As the gatekeepers to Iceland, airline companies must share their brunt of the responsibility. Despite the fact that travelling to Iceland via alternative options is largely unpractical, it must not be overlooked that the airline industry has, for decades, fought legislative action to combat carbon-related climate change. In doing so, airlines have directly opposed the principles they claim to hold so dear.
Of course, given the large profits raked in each year by airlines, their ability to mask their true colours and deceive the consumer into buying into their eco-friendly image is a force of nature in its own right. Responsible tourists are able to detect this hypocrisy easily, and thus, should take the matter into account when planning their trip.
In truth, it is unlikely that Iceland will see the visitor numbers currently projected by the government in future years. According to these predictions, some 2.5 million guests are expected to visit Iceland in 2018, but as elsewhere, the novelty of a destination tends to wear off in time.
With that being said, Iceland’s boom is unexampled, in major part due to the country’s small population. Only very tenuous links can be drawn with other nations experiencing their own tourism booms.
Circulating in Iceland are a number of theories on how to ensure the industry’s proliferation. As mentioned above, on one side of the argument there is a call to temporarily cap the number of visitors to the country every year. This way, government agencies would have the respite needed to improve and invest in Iceland’s infrastructure, its road systems and site accessibility.
Though it sounds like a long shot and starkly in contention with the onslaught of tourist money, Iceland has prepared itself for the long-term in such ways before. Consider the fishing quotas implemented in the 1980s; without such strict regulation, Iceland's fish stocks would not be at the sustainable levels we see and cherish today.
The government has already set out its plans to place nature conservation and outdoor activities hand in hand. As set out in Outdoor Activities in Harmony of Nature, the objectives prior to 2020 are as follows;
To achieve these ambitions, the government is focusing their attention on a handful of important areas; an individual's right to travel, the carrying capacity of tourists sites, site improvements, increased patrols, more information provided to tourists and an active tourist participation in monitoring costs.
All in all, Iceland is a small country with a small population and a parliament that only has space for 63 members. In light of such facts, the country should be able to pull together to collectively make tourism a force for good in Iceland and not one that will continue to pressure the population indefinitely.
Having survived and prospered a 2008 banking crisis, a housing market collapse, a devalued currency and a peak in unemployment, overtourism is just one more hurdle for the Icelandic people to overcome. Be under no illusion, however; to do so will take the participation and cooperation of numerous agencies: government officials, airlines, tourist boards, tour operators and YOU.
There are a number of ways in which the tourists themselves can contribute to sustainable tourism practices. First and foremost it is imperative that you do some prior reading on the culture you would like to visit. Learning about the environment in which you will be travelling helps to put you in a respectful frame of mind and will also inform you about some basic mistakes you can avoid.
Acting responsibly during your visit to Iceland will also help to maximise your time and experience. By reflecting on how the locals interact with one another and their environment, you'll find yourself fitting seamlessly into the fabric of Icelandic culture.
One of the first observations visitors to Iceland often make is how clean the nation’s streets and countryside are. Although other cultures might have a more nonchalant attitude to littering, Icelanders are incredibly proud, diligent and proactive when it comes to keeping their environment clean.
Litter bins are prevalent on almost every street corner of downtown, ensuring that there is always a better spot for that empty can of coke than the neighbouring bushes.
One of the greatest dangers is the exponential rate in which littering occurs. If one is strolling down an unblemished street, then one is far more likely to contemplate being the first individual to tarnish it with their laziness.
On the other hand, if the street were already to look as though it is habitually used as a passing rubbish dump, one is immediately inclined to care less about its active protection.
In truth, respecting the environment does not just mean refraining from littering, it means taking a proactive approach to the problems that already exist. If during your time here you happen to stumble across litter that can be easily removed, we implore you to do so.
After all, we as a species must evolve past our sense of entitlement and belonging, and instead, strive to better ourselves and the environment whenever the opportunity to do so arises.
Whilst travelling in Iceland, keep conscious of the environmental regulations that are in place to preserve and protect the country's nature. Off-road driving, for instance, is illegal given the impact and irreversible damage that such action causes to Iceland's fragile environment. To find safe routes and road conditions, one can check the Icelandic Road and Coastal Administration's English website here.
So too is treading off designated hiking trails and paths; remember, much of Iceland is covered with a delicate blanket of moss, a particular species that takes many years to recover if damaged. Because of this, camping on private property outside of designated campsites is illegal. If you seek permission from the landowner, however, they may be happy to grant you access for a small fee.
One surefire way of supporting the Icelandic economy is to favour local businesses. By purchasing local goods and cuisine, and seeking out those companies who prioritise environmental causes, you will be making a direct impact on the longevity of Iceland as a must-visit destination.
Supporting the local business also allows you to come in direct communication with Icelandic people; by engaging this way, you will gain a deeper insight into the nature of daily life here and see for yourself the incredible talent, commitment and entrepreneurship demonstrated by the Icelandic small-business community.
For those who live in Reykjavik, it is never long until a conversation regarding Airbnbs crops up. Due to the tourist boom and a natural, human desire to make the best out of a situation, a large number of Icelandic landlords have striven to use their properties as pop-up Bed and Breakfasts. In doing so, they have alleviated the pressure on tourist accommodation, making it possible for the country to handle so many people.
In truth, when it comes to accommodation, Iceland is stuck between a rock and a hard place. Given that a hotel construction project will often take a few years to complete, the need for accommodation in the meanwhile has caused an inordinate amount of stress for locals and travellers alike.
As simple arithmetic would have it, renting to tourists is far more profitable than renting to locals; unfortunately, this means a great number of downtown residents have been evicted from their homes and forced to live further away from the city centre.
From 1st January 2017, new legislation was implemented regulating the spread of Airbnbs in Reykjavik. Property owners have 90 days of the year to rent out their rooms and apartments to tourists, or until they have acquired 2000,000 ISK in gross rental income. Property owners who intend to do this will have to first register with the police, pay a fee and provide all information relating to rental days, income and expenses.
Critics of this legislation pose a number of interesting points, highlighting the sheer complexity of the issue. Many point to Iceland's small police force, claiming they have neither the manpower nor resources to prosecute those who violate such terms.
It is expected that entrepreneurial Icelanders will continue the practise, all the while hedging their bets they won't be discovered. On top of that, it is highly conceivable that the new legislation is not really about protecting city residents, but instead Iceland's hotel industry during the winter months, the time when occupancy is at its lowest.
Unless you happen to reside in a country where clean drinking water is very much in short supply, there should be no reason, ever, to purchase and consume bottled water.
Quite frankly, there is no country on the planet where water is quite so fresh, natural and drinkable. Aside from the reality that there is absolutely no need to spend money on water that's exactly the same as that from the tap, plastic bottles cause an enormous level of damage to Iceland's ecosystem, be it in the surrounding coastal waters or inland.
The consumption of puffin and whale meat has long been a part of Icelandic culture, the people utilising the resources available to them to survive the hardships of this inhospitable, volcanic island. The Icelandic word ""hvalreki"" means ""beached whale"", a description of something positive that is unexpectedly at someone's disposal.
Whilst now considered a delicacy by certain Icelanders, others across the country are itching to fight this practice, especially wildlife operators who rely on puffin and whale watching as their livelihood. In the spirit of sustainability, experiencing such domestic wildlife from a distance is always a preferable option, especially considering that puffins were recently added to the Endangered Species list.
Although tourism is not the primary, driving factor for Iceland's whaling or hunting quota—the whaling quota is, for now, at least sustainable—it overlays the practice with an unnecessary justification, thus complicating the environmental and sustainability argument further.
Trying such exotic meats as whale and puffin have become a novelty for visitors arriving in the country, with many restaurants along Laugavegur advertising such products for sale. The reason why WHALE and PUFFIN are written in such large and bold lettering is to attract those who have never eaten it, nor had any prior inclination to do so. Guide to Iceland does not support the practice of whaling.
Now, given the international assertion that whaling is an outdated practise, this country's hunting of Minke Whales does little for Iceland's economy and even less for its reputation abroad. When it comes to arguments of tradition, the country must be honest with itself as to which traditions should be kept alive and which should be buried for good.

Without a measure of a doubt, tour guides are the frontline troops of Iceland’s tourist industry. Braving the island’s capricious weather, its disobedient terrain and an onslaught of underprepared visitors, they are, arguably, the herring fishermen of today’s economy, keeping the country and its guests in a constant state of security.
Be they whale watchers, super jeep drivers, scuba divers, hikers or cavers, you can guarantee there is a guide out there now, somewhere in the wilderness, working. With that in mind, one should always respect the experience and knowledge that such guides boast. This is, after all, their shooting ground, their land and their life, devoted to the guest and the activity at hand.
It goes without saying then that guides are an indispensable asset to the country’s workforce. Without foreign visitation, the boom in development, culture and industry here would simply be non-existent.
This is why, without much complaint, the idea that ""guides don't expect tips"" in Iceland slowly gnaws away at the mental well-being of many guides. Without a measure of a doubt, for the work done, their job is underpaid, physically demanding and encapsulates numerous challenges, least of all keeping a smile plastered on their faces when things get tricky.
Given the tipping culture of many of those travelling to Iceland, handing out a little extra is NEVER frowned upon, nor is it completely unexpected.
Last, but not least, you'd do well to do some background reading on Iceland before you arrive. Below you will find a number of background articles that might be of particular use to the conventional traveller to Iceland.

Copenhagen: In the tenth century, Erik the Red, a Viking from Iceland, was so impressed with the vegetation on another Arctic island he had found he called it “the green land”. Today, it’s Greenland’s rocks that are attracting outsiders – superpowers riding a green revolution.
The world’s biggest island has huge resources of metals known as rare-Earths, used to create compact, super-strong magnets that help power equipment such as wind turbines, electric vehicles, combat aircraft and weapons systems.
The metals are abundant globally, but processing them is difficult and dirty – so much so that the US, which used to dominate production, surrendered that position to China about 20 years ago.
As Greenland’s ice sheet and glaciers recede, two Australia-based mining companies – one seeking funding in the US, the other part-owned by a Chinese state-backed firm – are racing for approval to dig into what the US Geological Survey (USGS) calls the world’s biggest undeveloped deposits of rare Earth metals.
The contest underscores the polluting side of clean energy, as well as how hard it is for the West to break free of China in production of a vital resource. Rare Earth metals have many uses, and last year China produced about 90% of them, according to Toronto-based consultancy Adamas Intelligence. As US-China tensions mount, President Joe Biden’s administration said last month it will review key US supplies, including rare Earths, to ensure other countries cannot weaponise them against the US.
Each Greenland mine would cost about $500 million to develop, the companies say. Both plan to send mined material away for final processing, an activity that is heavily concentrated in China. The only rare earth mine now operating in the US – Mountain Pass in California – is partly owned by a Chinese state-backed company that currently sends material mined in the US to China for processing.
The Greenland sites are less than 16 km from each other at the southern tip of the island, near a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Debate on them has triggered a political crisis in the capital of Nuuk, forcing a general election on the island of 56,000, due in April. Many Greenlanders, while concerned about pollution, feel mining is key to develop their fragile economy. In a 2013 poll, just over half said they want raw materials to become the country’s main source of income.
The country may ultimately back either project, both or neither, but for those Greenlanders open to mining, the two proposals boil down to a choice between one mine that would not produce radioactive material and another that would.
The first mine, a private initiative from an Australian geologist who has presented it to US officials, would not involve nuclear material. It has won preliminary environmental approval, but it needs cash and a processing plan.
The second one has already spent more than $100 million preparing to mine, has proven processing technology through its Chinese partner, and won initial political support from Greenland’s coalition government. But its plans include exporting uranium, a nuclear fuel, to China, and it recently ran into strong opposition, including from residents of the nearby town of Narsaq.
“As indigenous people we have lived in harmony with nature for many, many years,” said Mariane Paviasen, an opposition lawmaker who lives in the town. “We use these lands to hunt and fish.”
Greenland, a self-governing territory of the Kingdom of Denmark, has a gross domestic product of around $3 billion – similar to Andorra and Burundi. With its people living mostly on fishing and grants from Copenhagen, its government is keen to attract foreign investment.
It does not have an estimate for royalties from the first project, but expects around 1.5 billion Danish crowns ($245 million) each year from the Chinese-linked one – equivalent to roughly 15% of public spending.
Greenland’s government did not respond to requests for comment for this story. Acting Minister of Resources Vittus Qujaukitsoq said last month that if Greenlanders suddenly decide they don’t want the second project, “we’ll make a fool of investors. The credibility of the whole country is at stake.”
Strategic resources
Greenland’s rare Earth metals are also a chance for America and Europe to regain control of a strategic resource.
The island’s potential as a source of the raw materials needed for renewable energy technologies gained momentum in 2010, when China threatened to cut off its supply of rare Earth metals to Japan, and tightened quotas to international buyers.
Prices for some of the metals have jumped in recent months, driven by surging demand for electric vehicles as well as concerns that Beijing may restrict sales.
Greenland’s position near the eastern flank of the United States makes it a sensitive location. Former US President Donald Trump offered to buy the island in 2019, and he was not the first US president to do so: In 1946, Harry S. Truman offered Denmark $100 million for it. A defence treaty between Denmark and the US dating back to 1951 gives the US military almost unlimited rights there, and Greenland houses the northernmost US military base.
Friedbert Pflüger, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council think tank, says the revenues generated by a major mine could give its owner leverage over policies in Greenland, and a strong Chinese presence there may pose strategic threats.
“The very presence of Chinese companies in Greenland could be used as justification for China to intervene,” said Pflüger, a former German politician and ex-deputy defence minister.
China’s foreign ministry said in a statement that such comments politicise economic and trade issues through “groundless speculation,” adding “China has always supported Chinese companies to carry out foreign economic cooperation in accordance with market principles and international rules.”
The US State Department said: “We encourage our allies and partners to carefully review any investments … that could give China access to critical infrastructure in ways that compromise their security or allow China to exert undue, adverse influence over their domestic economies.”
Denmark, which handles foreign affairs and defence for Greenland, has in the past headed off Chinese involvement in infrastructure projects, which government sources say was because of security concerns. Foreign Minister Jeppe Kofod declined to comment on the security implications of China’s involvement. But he told Reuters that Copenhagen’s close ties with the US “should not be seen as an obstacle to commercial investments in Greenland”.
China is a member of the International Atomic Energy Agency, so it can import uranium from Greenland. But since the fuel is used in nuclear weapons, that would be sensitive. Copenhagen, which has the final say, declined to comment.
Trump’s offer
Trump’s offer for Greenland aimed to help address Chinese dominance of rare earth supplies. Those involved say he was partly following up on talks between US officials and a privately held company called Tanbreez Mining Greenland A/S. Tanbreez is the owner of the first Greenland site – Kringlerne, or Killavaat Alannguat in Greenlandic.
The company’s owner, Australian geologist Greg Barnes, told Reuters he had met US officials weeks before Trump made the offer, and the company website shows Barnes with them and the former US ambassador to Denmark on a site visit. The USGS confirmed its officials had visited the site in 2019; Washington and a representative for the former president declined to comment.
Barnes said he had put A$50 million ($38.6 million) of his own cash into the Greenland project. New York-based investment banker Christopher Messina, managing director at capital markets advisory services firm Mannahatta Partners, is trying to assemble more financing. He says Kringlerne is “such a huge deposit that what comes out of it could satisfy manufacturing demands in the US for years to come.”
Whether or not that pans out, Barnes says the metals produced by his project can be processed outside China, although he has not yet decided where, and declined to say at what cost.
He said the royalties it would generate for Greenland would be roughly the same as those promised by the China-linked plan. “We’ve managed to get our capital costs down without Chinese technology,” Barnes told Reuters.
The only major plant outside China that does the complex work of separating individual rare earth elements is in Malaysia. But others – including the Mountain Pass mine in the US – are planning or have started to build such facilities.
“For the foreseeable future, China is going to be the major player in all of these supply chains simply because it’s so far advanced and because it’s not stopping and waiting for alternatives to catch up,” said Ryan Castilloux, head of Adamas.
Tanbreez says half the rare earth metals it mines would be lanthanum and cerium – relatively plentiful metals used in telescope lenses and auto catalysts to cut emissions. About a fifth would be yttrium, which is in demand for lasers and the superconductors used in quantum computing.
Neither of the Greenland projects would be pollution-free. Both plan for mined rock to be locally crushed and separated into concentrates to send for final processing.
Tanbreez’s mining waste will be piped to a lake which, while it does not contain fish, feeds a river with a large population of Arctic char. Turbid water could impact the char, according to the company’s environmental report, which says it plans to dump some 550 tonnes a day of waste material into the lake and will dam it to prevent disruption downstream.
Tanbreez’s plan has passed the public consultations stage and received a government permit in September. Now the company is working on parliament approval.
“Critical period”
Both the Greenland projects, though run from Australia, are part of a European Union initiative, the European Raw Materials Alliance, to boost Europe’s output of critical minerals and cut dependence on China for rare Earth metals.
The alliance, funded by the EU, is coordinating investment and providing seed money for European mines, processing plants and industries such as magnets.
Last year, the EU kick-started 10 billion euros ($12 billion) of investment into rare earth and other green-energy-related projects, and it says its demand for rare earth metals could surge as much as tenfold by 2050. It says China currently makes up 98% of its supply.
“This is a very critical period of time,” says the Alliance’s head Bernd Schäfer. “We in Europe are facing raw materials scarcity on many levels and also the need for action.”
The rival mountaintop site not far from Tanbreez is called Kvanefjeld, or Kuannersuit in Greenlandic. For John Mair, managing director of its owner, Greenland Minerals Ltd., it’s a world-class opportunity at the right moment.
Kvanefjeld’s main offer is neodymium, needed for wind turbines. Brussels says the EU’s demand for the metal may reach 13,000 tonnes per year by 2050, three times more than it used in 2015. Neodymium is also used in combat aircraft.
Greenland Minerals is a listed firm in which Chinese company Shenghe Resources is the biggest shareholder, with just under 10%. Shenghe, which also has a similar size stake in Mountain Pass, declined to comment for this story.
Greenland Minerals, which bought its concession from Barnes, says its planned mine will, at least initially, send minerals it produces to China for final processing. It says it plans to find a site in Europe but has not said when.
The company has a strong hand. Back in 2011, the estimated costs for setting up Kvanefjeld were $2.3 billion. By 2019, these shrank to $505 million, the company says: Shenghe, whose biggest shareholder is a state-run Chinese mineral research institute, has helped boost efficiency.
But Greenland Minerals faces public opposition. It is one step behind Tanbreez in the environmental vetting process – and its ores include significant amounts of radioactive materials.
When Greenland Minerals embarked on public consultations this year, protests erupted. At one meeting in Narsaq on February 10, locals both inside and outside the hall banged windows and played loud music to disrupt presentations.
As opposition mounted, a small pro-mining party, Demokraatit, triggered a general election by pulling out of Greenland’s coalition in early February.
Polls suggest Greenland’s main opposition party, Inuit Ataqatigiit (IA), which has a zero-tolerance policy for uranium, will become the biggest in parliament, so would be first to try to form a new coalition.
“Our aim,” IA lawmaker and Narsaq resident Paviasen told Reuters, “is to halt the (Kvanefjeld) mining project.” But IA says it has not expressed opposition to Tanbreez, which is seen as less of a threat to the environment.
Kvanefjeld would dump much more waste than Tanbreez – about 8,500 tonnes each day – into a lake on top of the mountain, the Greenland Minerals plan says.
Greenland Minerals says any increase in background radiation from its Kvanefjeld mine will be minimal. It plans to build a concrete 45-meter dam to contain the radioactive waste and to spray water on the ground to keep the dust from blowing away.
The dam will be built to international standards to “withstand even the worst imaginable seismic activity,” it said in a report submitted to Greenland’s government last year.
Even so, residents say they worry contaminated water will seep into nearby rivers or that the dam will fail entirely. They cite the collapse of a mining dam in Brazil two years ago that killed 270 people.
As the crisis has deepened, Greenland Minerals’ shares have dropped by more than 50%. If the mine goes ahead, Paviasen says, many people plan to move away.

By Eric Maurice
Iceland definitively dropped its EU membership bid on Thursday (12 March), nearly six years after having made the demand.
""The government of Iceland has no intentions to resume accession talks"", country’s foreign affair minister, Gunnar Sveinsson, wrote in a letter to enlargement commissioner Johannes Hahn and Latvia’s foreign affairs minister Edgars Rinkevics.

Talks were suspended in May 2013 after a centre-right coalition, opposed to EU membership, had come to power.
By that time, 27 of the 35 legislative chapters in accession talks had been opened and 11 concluded. But disputes remained on several issues, mainly to do with agriculture and fisheries.
Fishing quotas, especially for mackerel, have for many years been a divisive issue between Iceland and the EU and had not yet been negotiated in the accession talks.
An agreement on mackerel quotas was reached by the EU with Norway and the Faroe Islands but not with Iceland in March 2014.
Reykjavik denounced it as an agreement made ""behind [its] back"" after it failed to find a common ground with the other countries.
""Iceland’s interests are best served outside the European union"", the country’s government website said Wednesday.
Iceland made its membership request in July 2009, just as it was in the throes of violent financial crisis. EU member states decided to open talks with the island in December of the following year.
Now Iceland is experiencing economic growth again (it grew by 1.9 percent last year) making accession to a still crisis-ridden EU less attractive.
The decision by prime minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson’s government to leave EU talks for good has been criticized by the opposition.
Social Democrat leader Arni Pall Arnasson regretted that the government took the decision with no formal approval by parliament.
When talks were suspended in 2013, thousands of people demonstrated to protest against the decision and the opposition called for a referendum on the issue.
But the government Wednesday said it has ""no intention of holding a referendum on the negotiations with the European Union as this would constitute voting on an issue the government already opposes.""
""If the process will be recommenced at a later date, the present government believes it important not to move forward without referring to the nation first with the question of whether it wants to accede to the EU,"" it added.
In his letter to the EU, Gunnar Sveinsson spoke of ""the importance of continued close relations and cooperation between the EU and Iceland"".
The country is a member of the EU's borderless Schengen area and of the European economic area, which gives it access to the EU’s single market with no tariff barrier for its fish and agriculture products. . ",True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False

As rising temperatures drastically reshape Iceland’s landscape, businesses and the government are spending millions for survival and profit.

HÖFN, Iceland — From the offices of the fishing operation founded by his family two generations ago, Adalsteinn Ingólfsson has watched the massive Vatnajökull glacier shrink year after year. Rising temperatures have already winnowed the types of fish he can catch. But the wilting ice mass, Iceland’s largest, is a strange new challenge to business.
“The glacier is melting so much that the land is rising from the sea,” said Mr. Ingólfsson, the chief executive of Skinney-Thinganes, one of Iceland’s biggest fishing companies. “It’s harder to get our biggest trawlers in and out of the harbor. And if something goes wrong with the weather, the port is closed off completely.”
A warmer climate isn’t affecting just Höfn, where the waning weight of Vatnajökull on the earth’s crust is draining fjords and shifting underground sediment, twisting the town’s sewer pipes. As temperatures rise across the Arctic nearly faster than any place on the planet, all of Iceland is grappling with the prospect of a future with no ice.
[In Scandinavia, climate change is leading entrepreneurs to invest in wineries.]
Energy producers are upgrading hydroelectric power plants and experimenting with burying carbon dioxide in rock, to keep it out of the atmosphere. Proposals are being floated for a new port in Finnafjord, now a barren landscape in the east, to capitalize on potential cargo traffic as shipping companies in China, Russia and Arctic nations vie to open routes through the melting ice. The fishing industry is slashing fossil fuel use with energy-efficient ships.
Glaciers occupy over a tenth of this famously frigid island near the Arctic Circle. Every single one is melting. So are the massive, centuries-old ice sheets of Greenland and the polar regions. Where other countries face rising seas, Iceland is confronting a rise in land in its southernmost regions, and considers the changing landscape and climate a matter of national urgency.
When Europe suffered record-breaking heat in July, Iceland’s capital, Reykjavik, clocked its highest temperatures ever. Iceland’s economy is on the cusp of a recession, partly because an important export, the capelin fish, vanished this year in search of colder waters. This week, the United Nations warned that the world’s land and water resources are being exploited at an unprecedented rate.
“Climate change is no longer something to be joked about in Iceland or anywhere,” Gudni Jóhannesson, Iceland’s president, said in an interview, adding that most Icelanders believe human activity plays a role. “We realize the harmful effects of global warming,” he said. “We are taking responsibility to seek practical solutions. But we can do better.”
The country elected an environmentalist, Katrín Jakobsdóttir, as prime minister in 2017 on a platform of tackling climate change. Her government is budgeting $55 million over five years for reforestation, land conservation and carbon-free transport projects to slash greenhouse gas emissions. More will be spent by 2040, when Iceland expects businesses, organizations and individuals to be removing as much carbon dioxide from the atmosphere as they put in.
Environmental activists say that still isn’t enough to make Iceland, a wealthy nation of just 350,000 people, a model. Despite generating clean geothermal energy and hydropower, major industries including aluminum and ferrosilicon production also produce a third of Iceland’s carbon dioxide. Tourism, now the engine of growth after a banking collapse in 2008, has flourished with warmer weather but added to Iceland’s climate woes as planes packing millions of visitors push per capita carbon dioxide emissions above that of every country in Europe.
Bigger nations like Norway and Finland have cut emissions more, and over 190 other countries except the United States have pledged to combat climate change under the Paris agreement. But with the impact in Iceland more visible than in other nations, it is doing what it can — while trying to turn the warming climate into an economic advantage.
“Let’s look at practical solutions instead of being filled with despair,” Mr. Jóhannesson said.
Ólafur Eggertsson, a farmer, has been anticipating how to tame the wilds of his new environment. On a sunny day, he pointed to a sparkling glacier sprawled thinly atop the nearby Eyjafjallajökull volcano on Iceland’s southern rim. Eyjafjallajökull erupted spectacularly in 2010, snarling European air traffic and raining ash over the Thorvaldseyri farm run by his family since 1906. But even before that, the glacier had been visibly retreating, and far faster than when his father and grandfather worked the land.
That alarms him, he said, because glaciers keep volcanoes cool. Scientists predict more eruptions in the coming century as the glaciers melt. Mr. Eggertsson is working to make the farm carbon neutral to prevent more warming, by transforming it from a mainly dairy operation to an 160-acre estate with barley and rapeseed fields — crops that couldn’t grow in the cold climate 50 years ago.
He is converting the rapeseed to biofuel. And Mr. Eggertsson, who plans to ramp up his 364,000-euro investment in the crop business in coming years, is hoping that Iceland’s farmers will one day grow enough barley to avoid importing it on polluting ships and planes.

“Sometimes what I’m doing feels like a drop in the ocean,” Mr. Eggertsson said, pulling handfuls of barley from the soil. “But humans are contributing to warming. I have no choice but to act.”
Others are finding deals in the demand from companies and people eager to offset their carbon footprint. Near Mr. Eggertsson’s farm, Reynir Kristinsson this year planted 200,000 native birch trees on 700 acres of volcanic flatland that his nongovernmental organization, Kolvidur, leases from the state.
More than a million trees have been purchased by Icelandic companies and foreign ones like Ikea since 2010. Mr. Kristinsson is negotiating with Isavia, Iceland’s airport operator, in hopes of crafting a deal to plant trees for every tourist and Icelander who flies in and out of the island, and is bidding to lease 12,000 more acres, forecasting “exponential growth.”
Some companies are just trying “to green wash” their image, Mr. Kristinsson acknowledged. But as consumers demand transparency, businesses are more serious about protecting the environment and know they have to spend substantial money toward battling the changes. “If they don’t show they’re acting responsibly, they will lose clients,” he said.
Yet most of Iceland’s volcanic terrain is deforested, and it will take decades for newly planted trees to absorb carbon at a large scale. Trees are certainly not a fast fix for Iceland’s glaciers, which scientists say now can no longer recover the ice they are losing.
That includes Vatnajökull, which once stretched over more than a tenth of Iceland and now covers 8 percent of this 40,000-square mile island. Named a Unesco World Heritage site in June, it is shrinking by a length of nearly three football fields a year in some places.
In Höfn, Mr. Ingólfsson’s business has been thwarted by the change. While the land here has risen nearly 20 inches since the 1930s, in the last decade alone, it has floated four inches above sea level. It is forecast to rise as much as six feet in the coming century, according to the Icelandic Meteorological Office.
That new land is preventing Mr. Ingólfsson from acquiring bigger-capacity trawlers that his competitors use. HB Grandi, a Reykjavik-based rival that is one of Iceland’s largest fishing companies, has invested in enormous super-trawlers that use less fossil fuel and allow for a larger catch. This year, cold water capelin can’t be found. But mackerel are now swimming in the warmer currents around Iceland, and the value of the catch has risen noticeably.
Such investment — which also translates into smaller fleets — is running through Iceland’s fishing industry, and fits a national strategy to reduce carbon emissions that contribute to ocean acidification and harm fish. The transformation is important and strategic: Fish account for 39 percent of Iceland’s exports.
Mr. Ingólfsson’s trawlers can now move in and out only at high tide, and his business suffers for that. Last winter, two were stuck outside the harbor when a storm hit, he said, forcing the catch to be offloaded at another factory on the east coast, leaving scores of workers at his Höfn plant idle.
“Unless we find a solution,” he said, “things will just get worse.”
Glacial melting is also expected to oversaturate watersheds in the next century, and scientists predict that they then will dry up, forcing energy producers to adapt. Landsvirkjun, the state-run energy company, which generates three-quarters of Iceland’s power, is building room for additional water turbines at its dams. It is also building new capacity for wind turbines to operate when the glaciers die.
“From a design perspective, we’re taking into account what will happen in the next 50 to 100 years,” said Óli Grétar Blondal Sveinsson, the executive vice president for research and development. “There will be no glaciers,” he said flatly.
That prospect has jolted Icelanders — and some visitors — to a realization that they are witnessing a treasure vanish. Steinthór Arnarson, 36, quit his job as a lawyer three years ago to open a tour business at the Fjallsárlón lagoon, employing 20. He takes visitors on inflatable boats around iceberg-studded waters that barely existed two decades ago.
A native of the area, he recalled the lake’s being a fraction of its current size when he was a teenager. When he returned in 2012, the Vatnajökull outlet here had melted so much that the lagoon had grown a mile wide, and thundering rivers nearby had shifted course.
Many of the 200 tourists who visit daily want to see Vatnajökull before it disappears, Mr. Arnarson said.
“People are stunned by the glacier’s beauty and feel like me,” he said, gazing at the 130-foot-high wall of blue ice soaring from the water.
“It’s nice to see a piece of it break off,” he said. “But it’s really sad.” . ",True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False

Not the most obvious place for graduates to launch their careers, but a thriving tourism industry and a range of skills shortages ensure Iceland has plenty to offer international workers
This Nordic island is sparsely populated with a small number of urban hubs, and while the summer days may seem to last forever (with 22 hours of daylight), the winter months can be particularly harsh. That said, there are a number of reasons why foreigners should consider working in Iceland.
The country has one of most impressive unemployment rates in Europe (3.7% in January 2020). Iceland is also the most peaceful country in the world - a title it has held since 2008, according to the Global Peace Index 2019.
While Iceland is one of the more expensive European locations, there's plenty to see and do that won't cost you a penny. Make the most of your generous holiday allowance by exploring geysers, glaciers, mountains and volcanoes. You could visit the famous Blue Lagoon, or watch the Northern Lights dancing in the sky. The country also puts on an impressive number of festivals so check out the Winter Lights Festival, International Literary Festival, The Colour Run, Pride and the International Film Festival, all held in the capital city of Reykjavik.
Jobs in Iceland
Iceland's economy was hit hard by the banking crisis in 2008 but has since recovered strongly, largely thanks to its tourism industry. The country welcomed nearly two million tourists in 2019 - six times its population of just 330,000.
The country's major industries include:
- aluminium smelting
- fish processing
- geothermal power
- hydropower
- medical/pharmaceutical products
- tourism.
Popular graduate jobs
- Construction
- Healthcare
- IT
- Tourism.
You can search for jobs in Iceland at:
Local newspapers and trade unions are good places to find openings if you're job hunting in Iceland, and it's also worth registering with recruitment agencies.
Skills shortages
There are currently six workers to every retired person in Iceland, but it's predicted that by 2040 there will only be three. Iceland is in need of roughly 2,000 foreign workers each year until then to address this imbalance and combat the repercussions of an ageing population.
In particular, the healthcare, construction, IT and tourism sectors are in need of workers. This can be attributed to a number of factors - for instance, disability rates in Iceland are increasing, and new technology is being developed at a faster rate than workers can be trained to use it.
If you can apply your skills and experience to any of these shortage areas, you'll be highly valued by employers.
How to get a job in Iceland
As Reykjavik is Iceland's economic, cultural and education hub, you're most likely to find success in the capital, unless you're hoping to work in agriculture or at a fishery.
The Directorate of Labour advises sending speculative applications to the companies you'd like to work for, as positions are not always advertised. You can also use social media platforms, such as LinkedIn, to build a network of contacts and discover available opportunities.
Most companies accept job applications via email. Enclose a short introductory message along with your CV and cover letter. Employers are looking for a concise overview of your achievements and skills - neither your CV nor cover letter should exceed one page in length.
Interviews are held face-to-face, but can be conducted via telephone or Skype if you're out of the country. While they're a formal stage of the application process, you may find your interview takes place in a more informal setting than you're used to, such as in a local café.
Summer jobs
Thanks to Iceland's long summer days, there's plenty of opportunity for summer work.
Fluency in English will be a real benefit to the hospitality industry, where temporary positions - in restaurants or bars - are readily available, to support the demands of tourism growth.
Alternatively, for a different summer experience you could become an au pair or work on a farm.
Opportunities for casual and volunteer work can also be found on:
Visit the Icelandic Directorate of Labour for more guidance.
The European Voluntary Service (EVS) is funded by the European Commission and is aimed at 17 to 30-year-olds who would like to volunteer abroad in areas such as youth work, cultural activities, social care or environmental protection. Placements last between two weeks and 12 months.
Teaching jobs
There's limited scope to teach English in Iceland, as the vast majority of the population speak the language to varying degrees and it's taught in schools from an early age.
However, opportunities do exist for skilled candidates hoping to teach at an advanced level. You'll need a Bachelors degree and relevant language qualification, such as a TEFL certificate, to secure a position.
A focus on delivering high standards of teaching in Iceland means that prior teaching experience is highly desirable for these roles. Holding more advanced qualifications, such as a Masters degree, is also viewed as advantageous.
Internships
By completing an internship in Iceland, you'll be able to explore a new country while boosting your employability. The majority of intern positions are located in Reykjavik, and not all will be paid. Search for vacancies at:
It may also be possible to secure an internship by applying speculatively to companies that you're interested in. If you don't speak Icelandic, focus on larger firms that use English as their business language.
Icelandic visas
If you're moving to Iceland from an EEA (European Economic Area) country, you'll be able to live and work in the country without a work permit or visa. However, you'll need to register as a resident with Registers Iceland, the country's national registry, if you're staying for longer than three months (or six months, if you arrive in the country as a jobseeker).
The EEA comprises all European Union (EU) member states plus Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein. In addition, Swiss nationals have the same rights as citizens of EEA countries.
If you're from a non-EEA country and plan on staying in Iceland for longer than three months, you'll need to hold a valid residence permit. Your employer will apply for this permit once you've accepted an offer of employment, meaning you won't be able to arrive in Iceland as a jobseeker.
Residence permits are divided into three categories. They're for:
- workers with expert knowledge
- athletes
- workers filling temporary labour shortages.
Visit the Icelandic Directorate of Immigration for more information.
In submitting an application you'll incur a fee, which is currently ISK 15,000 (roughly £87). It's advisable to apply as soon as you can - the process typically takes up to 90 days. Contact the embassy in your home country to get started.
If you're moving from an EEA country you'll be entitled to free public insurance once you've been a legal resident of Iceland for six months, which you can apply for from the day your legal residence is registered. Find out more at Work in Iceland - Health Insurance.
Language requirements
As the majority of nationals speak English, learning Icelandic won't be necessary to move to the country. However, having a basic grasp of Icelandic will help you to settle in and get by. It also demonstrates to employers that you're committed to becoming a part of Icelandic life.
You can start learning the language before arriving in the country, with free courses such as Icelandic Online. Offered at different difficulty levels, this course also provides a premium service to candidates at beginner and lower intermediate levels for an additional fee.
How to explain your qualifications to employers
Qualifications gained in the UK and elsewhere in Europe will generally be recognised by employers in Iceland. Visit Europass and ENIC-NARIC for more information about having your qualifications evaluated.
What's it like to work in Iceland?
A 40-hour working week, Monday to Friday, is the national average. You'll usually work eight-hour days with lunch and coffee breaks. You'll also have the right to a minimum of 11 hours rest in a 24-hour period, meaning if you travel for work and arrive home late, your next working day will start 11 hours later, even if that's after your usual start time.
Workers are entitled to a minimum of 24 days of paid leave per year on top of 15 public holidays.
The amount of tax you pay in Iceland depends on your salary. However, only 75% of the income of foreign experts in their field is taxed for the first three years they work in the country, if certain conditions are met.

aljazeera,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/3/20/icelandic-volcano-erupts-lighting-up-night-sky-near-reykjavik ,"Popular glaciers are melting so fast that guides are being forced to constantly reinvent how they carry out tours.
Public advised to stay away and the main road from the capital region to Keflavik airport was temporarily closed on Friday.
A volcano erupted just 40km (25 miles) from Iceland’s capital Reykjavik on Friday, with red lava spewing out of the ground and a crimson glow lighting up the night sky.
Streams of red lava could be seen flowing out of a fissure in the ground in Geldingadalur, close to Mount Fagradalsfjall on the Reykjanes Peninsula in southwestern Iceland, in footage filmed by a coastguard helicopter.
While Iceland’s Keflavik International Airport and the small fishing port of Grindavik are just a few kilometres away, the area is uninhabited and the eruption was not expected to present any danger.
“The eruption began at Fagradalsfjall in Geldingadalur at about 20:45 GMT tonight. The eruption is considered a small one and the eruption fissure is about 500-700 metres (1,640-2,300 feet) long. The lava is less than 1 square kilometre (0.4 square miles) in size,” the Icelandic Meteorological Office (IMO), which monitors seismic activity, said in a statement.
“There is little eruption activity in the area.”
The eruption site is in a valley, about 4.7km inland from the southern coast of the peninsula.
Police and coastguard officials raced to the scene, but the public has been advised to stay away and the main road from the capital region to Keflavik airport was temporarily closed on Friday.
There were no reports of ash fall, although tephra – solidified magma rock fragments – and gas emissions were to be expected.
Police ordered residents living east of the volcano to close their windows and stay indoors due to the risk of possible gas pollution carried by the wind.
Gas emissions – especially sulphur dioxide – can be elevated in the immediate vicinity of a volcanic eruption, and may pose a danger to health and even be fatal.
Pollution can exceed acceptable limits, even far away, depending on the winds.
Friday’s eruption took place in the Krysuvik volcanic system, which does not have a central volcano.
Eruptions in the region are known as effusive eruptions, where lava flows steadily out of the ground, as opposed to explosive ones which spew ash clouds high into the sky.

— Icelandic Meteorological Office – IMO (@Vedurstofan) March 19, 2021
The Krysuvik system has been inactive for the past 900 years, according to the IMO, while the last eruption on the Reykjanes Peninsula dates back almost 800 years, to 1240.
But the region has been under increased surveillance for several weeks after a 5.7-magnitude earthquake was registered on February 24 near Mount Keilir on the outskirts of Reykjavik.
That quake has been followed by an unusual number of smaller tremors – more than 50,000, the highest number since digital recordings began in 1991.
The seismic activity has moved several kilometres southwest since the quake, concentrating around Mount Fagradalsfjall, where magma was detected just one kilometre under the Earth’s surface in recent days.
Seismic activity had however slowed in the past few days.
Iceland has 32 volcanic systems currently considered active, the highest number in Europe. The country has had an eruption every five years on average.
The vast island near the Arctic Circle straddles the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, a crack on the ocean floor separating the Eurasian and North American tectonic plates.
The shifting of these plates is in part responsible for Iceland’s intense volcanic activity.
The most recent eruption was at Holuhraun, beginning in August 2014 and ending in February 2015, in the Bardarbunga volcanic system in an uninhabited area in the centre of the island.
That eruption did not cause any major disruptions outside the immediate vicinity.
But in 2010, an eruption at the Eyjafjallajokull volcano sent huge clouds of smoke and ash into the atmosphere, disrupting air traffic for more than a week with the cancellation of more than 100,000 flights worldwide which left some 10 million passengers stranded. .

nationalgeographic,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/iceland-greenland-name-swap ,"Is Iceland Really Green and Greenland Really Icy?
A longstanding rumor claims the names are a bait and switch.
A glance at the globe might make you wonder why Iceland seems oddly green, while Greenland is covered in ice. There’s even an Internet meme about it.
Schoolyard wisdom says this was intentional—Iceland’s Viking settlers thought the name would discourage oversettlement of their verdant island, while nobody cared if people tried to settle the ice-covered Greenland. But the truth is more complicated, and it has to do with both Norse custom and our shifting global climate.
The Facts
Over 80 percent of Greenland is covered in ice, but its grass was probably greener back in the summer of A.D. 982, when Erik the Red first landed in the southwest of the island. Sheep and potato farms still flourish in that same southwestern corner of Greenland, which sits at a more southerly latitude than neighboring Iceland.
Meanwhile, thanks to the Gulf Stream, Iceland’s sea surface temperatures can be about 10ºF (6ºC) warmer than Greenland. The milder climate means summers are intensely green throughout Iceland, even though 11 percent of that country is still covered with permanent ice cap. Vatnajökull is Europe’s largest glacier—a piece of ice the size of Puerto Rico.
So How Did the Names Get Switched?
The current names come from the Vikings. Norse custom was to name a thing as they saw it. For instance, when he saw wild grapes (blackberries, probably) growing on the shore, Erik the Red’s son, Leif Eríksson, named a portion of Canada “Vinland.”
Ice core and mollusk shell data suggests that from A.D. 800 to 1300, southern Greenland was much warmer than it is today. This means that when the Vikings first arrived, the Greenland name would make sense. But by the 14th century, maximum summer temperatures in Greenland had dropped. Lower temperatures meant fewer crops and more sea ice, forcing the local Norse population to abandon their colonies.
The Icelandic sagas fill in the other half of the switched-name story.
The legends say Naddador was the first Norse explorer to reach Iceland, and he named the country Snæland or “snow land” because it was snowing. Swedish Viking Garðar Svavarosson followed Naddador, and this led to the island being called Garðarshólmur (“Garðar’s Isle”). Alas, Garðar’s Isle was not so kind to its next arrival, a Viking named Flóki Vilgerðarson. Flóki’s daughter drowned en route to Iceland, then all his livestock starved to death as the winter dragged on. Depressed and frustrated, Flóki, the sagas say, climbed a mountain only to see a fjord full of icebergs, which led to the island's new name.
Like the iceberg that struck the Titanic, the spring ice that Flóki saw most likely drifted over from Greenland, but no matter—Flóki’s name stuck fast in the Viking world. Back in Norway, Flóki disparaged Iceland, but one member of his crew named Thorólf spread rumors that the new island was so rich, butter dripped from every blade of grass. Permanent settlement began soon after.
The new population on the island “felt they were part of the Nordic region, but they wanted to maintain a separate identity,” says Guðni Thorlacius Jóhannesson, a professor of history and newly elected president of Iceland. These settlers called themselves Íslendingur, which Guðni says means “a man from Iceland in the court of Norway.”
“An island has to have a name, and that is the one that stuck,” he adds.
A century later, Iceland was a growing democracy and the home of Erik the Red, who was banished from the country after killing three people in a feud. He sailed west in search of a new home—and found it. The sagas (in this case Erik the Red’s Saga of the Icelanders) tell the rest of the story in a single sentence:
“In the summer, Erik left to settle in the country he had found, which he called Greenland, as he said people would be attracted there if it had a favorable name.”
Thus, Iceland was named by a sad Viking and Greenland is the slogan of a medieval marketing scheme.
“It is unfortunate that the name Greenland stuck because that is not the name that the natives know it by,” Guðni says. Today’s Greenlanders call their country Kalaallit Nunaat, which simply means “Land of the People” in the Greenlandic Inuit language.
Switching Back
Unfortunately, the Land of the People Most Adept at Living With Ice now faces the impending realities of climate change. The rapidly melting Greenland ice sheet has resulted in cold temperatures in the North Atlantic, which has significantly slowed the Gulf Stream. Should the trend continue, Iceland will likely suffer much colder temperatures and even sea ice, while Greenland will continue to grow warmer and shed icebergs at an alarming rate.
In a century or two, it could very well be that the globe will make more sense, and Iceland and Greenland will better resemble the names they were given a thousand years ago.

Background
Settled by Norwegian and Celtic (Scottish and Irish) immigrants during the late 9th and 10th centuries A.D., Iceland boasts the world's oldest functioning legislative assembly, the Althingi, established in 930. Independent for over 300 years, Iceland was subsequently ruled by Norway and Denmark. Fallout from the Askja volcano of 1875 devastated the Icelandic economy and caused widespread famine. Over the next quarter century, 20% of the island's population emigrated, mostly to Canada and the US. Denmark granted limited home rule in 1874 and complete independence in 1944. The second half of the 20th century saw substantial economic growth driven primarily by the fishing industry. The economy diversified greatly after the country joined the European Economic Area in 1994, but Iceland was especially hard hit by the global financial crisis in the years following 2008. The economy is now on an upward trajectory, fueled primarily by a tourism and construction boom. Literacy, longevity, and social cohesion are first rate by world standards.

Economy
Economic overview
Iceland's economy combines a capitalist structure and free-market principles with an extensive welfare system. Except for a brief period during the 2008 crisis, Iceland has in recent years achieved high growth, low unemployment, and a remarkably even distribution of income. Iceland's economy has been diversifying into manufacturing and service industries in the last decade, particularly within the fields of tourism, software production, and biotechnology. Abundant geothermal and hydropower sources have attracted substantial foreign investment in the aluminum sector, boosted economic growth, and sparked some interest from high-tech firms looking to establish data centers using cheap green energy.
Tourism, aluminum smelting, and fishing are the pillars of the economy. For decades the Icelandic economy depended heavily on fisheries, but tourism has now surpassed fishing and aluminum as Iceland’s main export industry. Tourism accounted for 8.6% of Iceland’s GDP in 2016, and 39% of total exports of merchandise and services. From 2010 to 2017, the number of tourists visiting Iceland increased by nearly 400%. Since 2010, tourism has become a main driver of Icelandic economic growth, with the number of tourists reaching 4.5 times the Icelandic population in 2016. Iceland remains sensitive to fluctuations in world prices for its main exports, and to fluctuations in the exchange rate of the Icelandic Krona.
Following the privatization of the banking sector in the early 2000s, domestic banks expanded aggressively in foreign markets, and consumers and businesses borrowed heavily in foreign currencies. Worsening global financial conditions throughout 2008 resulted in a sharp depreciation of the krona vis-a-vis other major currencies. The foreign exposure of Icelandic banks, whose loans and other assets totaled nearly nine times the country's GDP, became unsustainable. Iceland's three largest banks collapsed in late 2008. GDP fell 6.8% in 2009, and unemployment peaked at 9.4% in February 2009. Three new banks were established to take over the domestic assets of the collapsed banks. Two of them have majority ownership by the state, which intends to re-privatize them.
Since the collapse of Iceland's financial sector, government economic priorities have included stabilizing the krona, implementing capital controls, reducing Iceland's high budget deficit, containing inflation, addressing high household debt, restructuring the financial sector, and diversifying the economy. Capital controls were lifted in March 2017, but some financial protections, such as reserve requirements for specified investments connected to new inflows of foreign currency, remain in place.

Telecommunication systems
general assessment: telecommunications infrastructure is modern and fully digitized, with satellite-earth stations, fiber-optic cables, and an extensive broadband network; LTE licenses providing 99% population coverage; small but most progressive telecom market in Europe; good competition among mobile and broadband markets (2020)
domestic: liberalization of the telecommunications sector beginning in the late 1990s has led to increased competition especially in the mobile services segment of the market; 37 per 100 for fixed line and 122 per 100 for mobile-cellular subscriptions (2019)
international: country code - 354; landing points for the CANTAT-3, FARICE-1, Greenland Connect and DANICE submarine cable system that provides connectivity to Canada, the Faroe Islands, Greenland, UK, Denmark, and Germany; satellite earth stations - 2 Intelsat (Atlantic Ocean), 1 Inmarsat (Atlantic and Indian Ocean regions); note - Iceland shares the Inmarsat earth station with the other Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden) (2019)
note: the COVID-19 outbreak is negatively impacting telecommunications production and supply chains globally; consumer spending on telecom devices and services has also slowed due to the pandemic's effect on economies worldwide; overall progress towards improvements in all facets of the telecom industry - mobile, fixed-line, broadband, submarine cable and satellite - has moderated

As one of the greenest countries on our planet, Iceland produces effectively 100% of its electricity and more than 70% of its total energy consumption from renewable energy sources. By combining exclusive access into the cutting-edge renewable energy facilities and substantial contact time with leading academic and industrial experts in the field, Iceland is the premier location for a truly hands-on educational experience and a professional launch pad into the fields of renewable energy and sustainability.
In partnership with Reykjavik University's Iceland School of Energy graduate study program, this course will also explore how Iceland is becoming a leader in renewable energy innovation. Participants will learn about how the country is utilizing innovative geothermal energy and hydro power technologies and putting these to work in the circular economy, food production, carbon sequestration and capture, and renewable fuel production.
Iceland is a top destination for awe-inspiring adventure travel and eco-tourism. Home to jaw-dropping natural landscapes and pristine topography as well as authentic Nordic culture and welcoming atmosphere, this destination is TGP's most popular destination for experiential sustainability education, bucket list adventuring, and unique cultural immersion.
We are also offering two dates with our ""Learn Now, Travel Later"" program model.

europa,https://www.fch.europa.eu/news/iceland-road-sustainable-transport ,"Iceland on the road to sustainable transport
On March 30, the ""Multi-fuel future"" seminar took place in Reykjavik, Iceland, with the purpose of sharing experiences and taking stock of the initiated efforts for a future green and sustainable Icelandic transport system.
Organised by the Icelandic companies, New Energy an Skeljungur, the seminar gathered an eclectic panel of key players with an all-sided industry representatives including car manufacturers such as Toyota and Hyundai, and the Mayor of Reykjavík, Dagur B. Eggertsson.
FCH JU Executive Director, Bart Biebuyck, attended the seminar as well, stating that “The exemplary use of renewable sources in its electricity infrastructure puts Iceland in the perfect position to develop a sustainable transport system based on green hydrogen”.
The gathering was also the occasion to showcase the increasing engagement from all parties to enable and facilitate the necessary transition. For example, Icelandic oil company Skeljungur, also operating on behalf of Shell in Iceland, stressed its commitment to environment preservation and stated its intention to accommodate alternative fuels on its traditional petrol stations.
Advancing with fuel cells and hydrogen
Three stations in the Reykjavik region will be supplying hydrogen through equipment contracted from Norwegian company NEL Energy, who will also provide a central hydrogen production plant, as announced earlier this year. One of these stations and the production unit are foreseen in FCH JU project H2ME-2. The hydrogen will be produced through water electrolysis, using renewable electricity from Iceland’s hydroelectric power plants.
The project also foresees the deployment of 10 hydrogen fuel cell cars including the Toyota Mirai and the Hyundai ix35 Fuel Cell (known as Hyundai Tucson Fuel Cell in North America).
This is a first step to turning Iceland, already an exemplary player in exploiting its generous in-house energy sources (hydro and geothermal) for its electricity and heating needs into a good player also on the transport front. The target is to have 40% of transport energy needs sourced through renewables by 2030.
With over 200 000 inhabitants out of ca. 300 000 in Iceland in the Reykjavik region, the building of 3 stations in this area should provide easy access to a considerable share of the population and has the potential to turn Iceland into a model island in terms of overall energy management.
The city of Reykjavik is a signatory of the FCH JU regions initiative and intends to become completely carbon neutral by 2040, according to its mayor Dagur B. Eggertsson.
Other speakers in the seminar included Valgeir Baldursson, CEO of Skeljungur, Lisa Ruf, Element Energy and coordinator for the H2ME project co-financed by the FCH JU, Ingvi Már Pálsson, Director General in the Ministry of Industries and Innovation, Jakob Krogsgaard Senior Vice President of NEL Hydrogen, Kristinn G. Bjarnason, Head of marketing and sales of Toyota in Iceland and Frank Meijer from Hyundai Motor Europe. The seminar was organized by Berglind Rán Ólafsdóttir, a board member at Icelandic NewEnergy.

matadornetwork,https://matadornetwork.com/change/iceland-green-economy/ ,"After economic collapse, here’s how Iceland rebuilt a powerful green economy
Iceland holds the honorable title of the world’s leading clean-energy economy and its president, Ólafur Ragnar Grímsson, is a relentless advocate of sustainable development. Earlier this year, I attended a seminar in which he shared lessons his country has learned about building and sustaining a green economy.
Here are a few takeaways that can help your country ignite a green economy.
1. Switching to alternative energy isn’t as costly as you think.
“The solution lies in a complete energy transformation from fossil fuel dependence to alternative energy,” Grímsson said.
Until the 1970s, Iceland was classified a developing country by the United Nations Development Programme. For centuries it was among the poorest in Europe, a nation of subsistence farmers and fishermen with 85% of its electricity coming from imported coal. Today, almost 100% of Iceland’s electricity and heat is generated from domestic renewable sources, mainly geothermal. Shifting from sending money overseas for coal to paying local electricity providers has saved Iceland the net profit of half of its GDP in 10 years.
2. Sustainable development is a profitable business.
Grímsson encourages a global discussion that positions the economy in the center of the conversation. “I bet things will be different when the world realizes what a profitable enterprise this energy shift is,” he said.
Engaging countries in sustainable development, while at the same time building profitable enterprises, starts with empowering people and communities to create sustainable businesses. “It is time to realize that this is a positive, economic, profitable change,” Grímsson added.
3. You hold the power.
Iceland’s politicians never mandated the switch to renewables. Instead, the change was made house by house, street by street, city by city, and district by district.
This bottom-up approach provided multiple business opportunities in the clean-energy sector — initiatives were led by local communities, small villages, individual entrepreneurs, and techonocrats. Over time, it created a dynamic of sustainable-business innovation and resulted in a complete national transformation. As a result, people now enjoy their electricity and heating services at a much cheaper rate.
4. This is a rare chance to do something good and make a profit.
“Building a green economy is paradoxically an area to be morally correct while making serious money. You can’t say the same for most of our current economic affairs,” said Grímsson.
5. Cultivating a green economy is an investment in the future.
Five years ago, the Icelandic banks collapsed. With its new economic model, the country has taught a valuable lesson to other European nations on how to survive a major financial hit. Thanks to the lasting investment in clean energy that started decades ago, today Iceland has 3% annual economic growth, and less than 5% unemployment. The cost of power and heat has significantly decreased, increasing the economic standards for families and decreasing production costs for industry.
6. If you build it, they will come.
The energy shift turned Iceland into a magnet for large foreign investment. Some of the biggest aluminum smelters, data-storage centers, and IT brands in the world are based there due to the long-term availability of clean energy at fixed prices. The strong marketing positioning it gives them doesn’t hurt either.
7. Eat what you grow.
To enhance the country’s food security, the local network of farming families capitalized on local greenhouse cultivation methods. This nation knows exactly where its food comes from and how it’s grown, organically behind glass walls or in fish farms.
Iceland is now the home of the biggest (glass-enclosed) banana plantation in Europe, and it’s seeking the title of the largest exporter of organic tomatoes in Europe.
8. Food security is everyone’s concern.
Enough food is probably produced in the world for everybody — the problem is in the storage technologies that most developing countries can’t afford. Thirty years ago, Icelandic fishermen came up with an idea to increase the storage time of fish heads and spines from a few days to up to two years. These fishy parts used to be thrown back into the ocean, but now Iceland exports them to Nigeria as a foodstuff, after it undergoes an elementary drying process utilizing geothermal heat. This operation required zero infrastructure cost and has proven commercially viable for both countries.
9. Ecotourism is a budding cash cow.
A country with such epic natural beauty as Iceland will inevitably attract ecotourism. But Iceland takes it a step further by linking some of its most-popular attractions with the green economy.
Take the Blue Lagoon for example: the most-popular attraction in Iceland sees more than 600,000 annual visitors in a country with an entire population of only about 323,000. In essence, the Blue Lagoon is nothing but an overflow of hot water from the Svartsengi geothermal plant. It didn’t exist 30 years ago. It was created by clever Icelandic engineers to attract tourists who pay 40 euros to bathe in the magical, steaming blue water.
Another popular tourist attraction in Reykjavík is the Perlan revolving restaurant complex, which sits on top of geothermal tanks and provides a fantastic panoramic view of the city.
10. Education is key.
Iceland isn’t just an example of green living; it’s also doing its part to heal the globe by trading sustainability education through its UN Geothermal Training Programme. It has trained more than 400 professionals from developing countries with geothermal potential since 1979, which has in turn led to the establishment of profitable diplomatic investments.
Moreover, Icelandic researchers, engineers, and scientists are involved in fruitful sustainable development projects in more than 40 countries around the world. Obviously, this small nation has big things to say on sustainable energy.
11. It’s not all about you — give others a hand.
On a diplomatic level, Iceland has developed partnerships with other geothermal-rich countries that are eager to copy its example, like Russia, the Philippines, Indonesia, and numerous Western and Eastern Europe nations.
In China, Iceland is helping Sinopec replace coal power stations with local geothermal heating. Also, Reykjavik Geothermal broke ground in July on the largest geothermal power plant in Africa, in Ethiopia’s Corbetti Caldera region, a flagship project that’s critically important for the continent.
12. Think outside the box.
The possibility of exporting electricity from Iceland to the UK via an ocean cable has recently emerged. Looking to upgrade its national grid, the UK is seeking new ways to develop electricity using renewable means and a link from Iceland might be the answer. Unless the UK (like Germany, the Netherlands, and other European nations) gains access to it, its entire energy system could degrade over the next few decades.
Hydro-rich European countries — notably in Scandinavia — are working on creating a network of underwater ocean cables to help neighboring countries avoid future electricity shortages. Norway extended such a cable to the Netherlands, and has already recovered its investment. . ",False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False
salmon-from-the-faroe-islands,http://salmon-from-the-faroe-islands.com/sustainability.html ,"Sustainability has become the hallmark of Faroese aquaculture.
The industry went through fundamental reform in 2003, and today the Faroe Islands has the most predictable fish production environment in the world.
In 2003, the Faroe Islands implemented one of the most comprehensive and stringent aquaculture veterinarian regulatory regimes in the world, known as the Faroese Veterinarian Act on Aquaculture. This legislation was enacted following requests from the industry for stringent legislation that would create a predictable and sustainable fish production environment.
The Faroese Veterinarian Act on Aquaculture is comprised of 81 paragraphs, all of which are designed to guarantee sustainability of the industry by protecting salmon from outbreaks of disease, by protecting the environment, and by ensuring fish welfare.
There are two regulatory agencies that have the responsibility of monitoring and enforcing the Faroese Veterinarian Act on Aquaculture:
- The Food and Veterinary Agency (Heilsufrøðiligastarvstova) – http://www.hfs.fo
- The Environment Agency (Umhvørvisstovan) – http://www.us.fo/
The Food and Veterinary Agency has the responsibility for all veterinarian matters, while the Environment Agency has responsibility for environmental matters. Producers are regularly inspected by both agencies.
The number of licenses for aquaculture in the Faroe Islands is strictly limited and regulated to ensure sustainability. The number and location of these licenses are based on extensive research and decades of experience. Licenses are located in selected fjords and sounds that effectively separate production areas and greatly improve area management and biological control.
Producers have to receive approval from both the Food and Veterinary Agency and the Environment Agency before commencing activities.
The Faroese Veterinarian Act on Aquaculture also stipulates the following:
- Mandatory vaccinations against infectious salmon anemia (ISA)
- Single generation single fjord strategy with mandatory fallowing for a minimum of two months between generations (all-in, all-out strategy) Click here to read more.
- Protocols and equipment which have to be in place on plants in order to avoid the spread of any potential disease
- All boats and trucks used for aquaculture have to be specifically designed for aquaculture transport and approved by the Food and Veterinary Agency
- Minimum distances between any aquaculture facilities
The industry's best biological results:
Thanks to ideal natural conditions, the Faroe Veterinarian Act on Aquaculture and a commitment to fish welfare and sustainability, the Faroese aquaculture industry has had the industry's best biological results in recent years.
The graph below shows that salmon from the Faroe Islands have the lowest biological feed conversion ratio (BFCR) of all major salmon producing countries. The BFCR is a measurement of how many kilos of feed it takes to produce one kilo of salmon. The BFCR is, therefore, a good indicator of sustainability:
The graph below demonstrates “smolt yields” for all major salmon producing countries. It shows that in recent years the Faroe Islands obtains the most out of each generation of salmon, which both reflects excellent fish welfare and the exceptionally low mortality rate amongst farmed salmon from the Faroe Islands: .

Its tiny population of around 120,000 people (almost 40% of all Icelanders) lives in a city with bold ambitions to cut its contributions to climate change and become a world leader in renewable energy.
Reykjavik has set itself the admirable target of being entirely free of fossil fuels by 2050. In terms of greenhouse gas emissions, it is already one of the greenest cities in the world. This is thanks largely to the bountiful resources beneath its resident’s feet.
Geothermal energy powers all buildings in the city – with an electricity network generating 750 megawatts (MW) of power from steam and a hot water distribution system producing 60m cubic metres of hot water annually.
All this clean energy warms homes, lights the streets, powers greenhouses that produce most of Reykjavik’s vegetable intake and heats very popular outdoor swimming pools.
It is estimated that city’s historic use of geothermal energy prevented as much as 110m tons of carbon dioxide from being emitted into the atmosphere in the period from 1944 to 2006. Up to 4m tons are currently being saved each year. Only around 0.1% of Iceland’s electricity is generated using fossil fuels.
Reykjavik is not a perfect model of a sustainable city, however. Public transport in Iceland is relatively underdeveloped, while it is ranked as one of the highest nations in the world for car ownership per capita.
This is due largely due to the impracticalities of providing transport infrastructure to such a sparsely populated island where demand is low.
Iceland has no public rail service, and many Icelanders use internal flights – probably the least sustainable type of journey it is possible to make – to get between major towns.
The capital does provide a hydrogen-fuelled bus service though, and for a city with such high levels of car ownership it is surprisingly uncongested, though it is by no means a typical gridlocked metropolis. Roughly nine out of 10 inhabitants live a five-minute walk away from a public green space.
While most of the cities described in this series provide an example for others to follow, there aren’t as many practical lessons to be learnt from Reykjavik.
Most urban centres are not so fortunate as to have developed atop such a volcanic region. There is decidedly less heat and energy to be plugged from the ground beneath London, for example.
Nevertheless, for a city to operate almost entirely without fossil fuels shows what can be achieved without costing the Earth.

The genetic cornerstone of Blue Lagoon Iceland
An unexpected wonder
When the Svartsengi Resource Park came to life in the late 1970s, one of the unintended benefits of the plant’s geothermal energy production was an enchanting reservoir that formed in the lava field beside the facility. No one knew it at the time, but this humble expanse signalled the dawn of the Blue Lagoon and the birth of a wonder of the world. Today, sustainability echoes through every dimension of the company’s ongoing evolution.
Architecture and design
Architecture and design at Blue Lagoon Iceland aspires to bring forth balance and harmony between man and nature. Buildings merge with the volcanic vista, becoming one with the land. Construction materials are chosen for their durability, repairability, and green production standards. And design elements are inspired by the shapes, colors, textures, and patterns of the surrounding landscape, creating an esthetic framework that blurs the distinction between interior and exterior.
Electricity, heating, and hot water
Geothermal energy, harnessed and produced at the Svartsengi Resource Park, is the sole source of electricity, heating, and hot water at Blue Lagoon Iceland, providing 100% of the company's needs in these three arenas.
The volcanic landscape
Blue Lagoon’s surrounding landscape—the Svartsengi lava field—is a frozen-in-time expanse of moss-covered volcanic rock that erupted from the earth in 1226 AD. In order to protect the lava and the delicate, centuries-old greenery, paths were created, enabling visitors to wander through the enchanting environment without harming the exquisite floral and geological features.
Lighting
Lighting throughout Blue Lagoon Iceland is created through energy efficient LED and OLED technologies. Adhering to the ideals of a human centric approach, every source of illumination was designed to harmonize with the landscape, bringing radiance that is never intrusive yet always energizing, nourishing, and engaging.
Dining
From locally sourced seafood, to produce cultivated on organic farms and in geothermal greenhouses, to free-roaming lamb that draws sustenance from Iceland’s endless frontiers, culinary sustainability reverberates through every dimension of the Blue Lagoon Iceland dining experience.
R&D and Blue Lagoon Skin Care
For more than four decades, research and development has been at the heart of Blue Lagoon’s quest for a world without waste, which is one of its aspirational mandates.
Powered by geothermal energy, the R&D center is a thriving scientific establishment—a place where inspiration and intellect have unlocked groundbreaking ways to recycle CO2. Likewise, green production methods—pioneered at the R&D center—are used for isolating, cultivating, and harvesting the beneficial elements of Blue Lagoon geothermal seawater: silica, minerals, and algae. These three natural wonders are the fulcrum of Blue Lagoon skin care. And the line itself adheres to the highest imperatives of eco-friendly sustainability.
Sustainability is manifest in respect for one another as much as it is manifest in respect for the environment.
A sustainable humanity
Another key vector in Blue Lagoon’s all-encompassing approach to sustainability is societal uplift. Sustainability is manifest in respect for one another as much as it is manifest in respect for the environment. It can be found in simple human dignity as much as it can be found in innovative, energy-saving technology. It is brought to life when we recycle just as much as when we respect—We Respect being one of Blue Lagoon’s brand pillars.
Blue Lagoon also funds a broad spectrum of philanthropic causes in the areas of youth sports, the arts, health, and wellness—contributing to the wellbeing of the communities on the Reykjanes Peninsula and throughout the country.
Harmony with nature
Ultimately, sustainability at Blue Lagoon Iceland is embodied not only through geothermal seawater—the heart and soul of the entire experience—but also through renewable electricity and heating, sustainable design, human centric lighting, locally sourced culinary ingredients, research and development, environmental preservation, and an acknowledgement that living in harmony with one another is a fundamental element of living in harmony with nature.

eco-business,https://www.eco-business.com/opinion/the-four-pillars-of-singapores-sustainable-development-success/ ,"Since the 1970s, economic development has helped to lift billions of people out of poverty. Social indices of human development such as healthcare and education have improved significantly.
But this progress is not even, and important challenges remain. Social inequality, education and work opportunities for women, and youth unemployment are still areas of concern for many countries.
Rising populism and protectionism in several advanced economies, technological disruptions, and new transnational security and pandemic threats add more complexity and uncertainty to health, safety, and development.
Our environment is also under stress. Since 1972, the world population has grown from 3.8 billion to 7.3 billion in 2015, and is expected to grow to 9.7 billion by 2050. More than 54 per cent of the global population already lives in urban areas.
Access to clean air, clean water, power, and sanitation are challenges in many countries. Low-lying coastal communities such as Singapore are also more vulnerable to rising sea levels due to climate change.
Individuals, companies, countries, and the global community will need to work together to develop solutions for sustainable development.
As a small, densely populated island nation with no natural resources, Singapore’s own sustainable development experience has focused on four key areas: Building a sustainable economy; creating a sustainable living environment; ensuring sustainable development for our people; and contributing to international collaboration.
Sustainable economy
Economic growth generates the resources to invest in education, research and development, security, infrastructure, and public services.
With no natural resources, Singapore has had to be resourceful to make a living for ourselves. This has entailed finding ways to create and add value, producing goods and services that are in demand by others, and making careful use of resources.
This has required integrated and long-term planning to optimise resources such as budget, land, manpower, energy, and more recently, carbon emissions, to ensure sustainable growth.
We made early choices to turn away very pollutive industries and took early action to switch to natural gas, the cleanest form of fossil fuel, for power generation. Today, we are among the 20 most carbon efficient countries in the world.
We will intensify our efforts as we work towards achieving our commitment under the Paris Agreement. We will reduce emissions intensity by 36 per cent from 2005 levels by 2030, and stabilise emissions with the aim of peaking by then.
We plan to introduce a carbon tax from 2019 so that those who emit the most carbon emissions will bear the cost to our environment and be encouraged to reduce their emissions. There is also much potential for our industries to save costs as we raise energy efficiency.
The carbon tax will also help align the costs and benefits of reducing emissions. We are also scaling up deployment for solar, aggregating demand across our agencies and testing floating solar photovoltaics on our reservoirs.
These plans can help us to move towards a low-carbon society, and also be a Living Laboratory for businesses, agencies, and research institutes to develop new products and services for the global economy.
According to the recently launched ‘Better Business, Better World” Asia report, opportunities in sustainability could contribute US$12 trillion to global GDP and create 380 million new jobs by 2030. I encourage our businesses to seize these opportunities.
Sustainable living environment
Our pioneer generation had a vision for a clean, green and sustainable Singapore for all Singaporeans. They instilled in all of us the consciousness that this little island is all that we have, and we have to look after it well.
Over the past 50 years, we have seen vast improvements in our housing, water, public health, and sanitation. Today, we are a City in a Garden with about 47 per cent green cover in Singapore. More than 80 per cent of households are within a 10-minute walk from a park.
We have 72 hectares of rooftop gardens and green walls today, and aim to triple this by 2030. These plans are outlined in our Sustainable Singapore Blueprint.
I have also just launched the Public Sector Sustainability Plan, which will catalyse sustainable practices, generate demand for green products and services, and encourage our public officers to think green. These initiatives will achieve a green and sustainable living environment for all Singaporeans.
“
With no natural resources, Singapore has had to be resourceful to make a living for ourselves. This has entailed finding ways to create and add value, producing goods and services that are in demand by others, and making careful use of resources.
Sustainable development for our people
Our people are our precious and only resource, and investing in them is of utmost importance.
Since the 1960s, we have worked to achieve mass education at the primary, secondary, and tertiary levels. Our next frontier is mass continuing education to prepare for the future of work. Rapid technological advances will change the nature of work and the skills required.
The knowledge and skills we acquire through conventional pre-employment education during the first 20 years of our lives will need to be refreshed to last a working life of over forty years.
Our workers must be prepared to constantly upskill and reskill, and move into new jobs and industries several times in their working lives. SkillsFuture Singapore will work closely with our associations, unions, and companies to support our workers to deepen and refresh their skills at key points in their careers.
International collaboration
Nations also need to work together to address global challenges. Issues such as transboundary air pollution or pandemics require a regional response, while others such as climate change require the contribution of all countries.
Singapore remains committed to the Paris Agreement and supports the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which provides a framework to guide national efforts in achieving the 17 Sustainable Development Goals.
In support of this agenda, we have trained more than 112,000 officials from over 170 developing countries in key areas such as sustainable urban, water, and human resource management, health, and education.
We will continue to share our sustainable development policies and expertise through leadership seminars in policymaking, workshops on urban governance in cities, and water and sanitation projects.
In the course of our development journey, Singapore has benefited from the experience of many countries as we developed, and we continue to do so. We hope that our collaborations in sustainable development can, in a similar way, make a small contribution to the development paths and journeys of other countries.
Through international partnerships, we can collectively find more efficient, more comprehensive, and more sustainable solutions to address global challenges.
The four aspects of sustainable development that I have highlighted work in combination with one another. Strong partnership between the public, private, and people sectors will be required to shape a sustainable future for all of us.

hiddeniceland,https://hiddeniceland.is/sustainable-tourism-in-iceland/ ,"Sustainable tourism in Iceland is a hot topic at the moment. Discussion of apparent over-tourism and environmental effects are at the forefront. But there is a lot more to it than that. From moss turning brown, to metal bars being raised at popular attractions, to walking off the path, to glaciers disappearing. We are all too aware of the changing environment that has been affected by both climate change and tourism.
Hidden Iceland began running tours back in November 2017 and decided right away that the only way to run tours in Iceland was to do so sustainably. Before picking up our very first customer we knew we had to start the right way. To us being a sustainable tourism company was not as simple as just following a strict Environmental Policy and leaving each place the same as it was found. This is a great mantra, but there is much more to be done.
So, the first thing we did was to utilise the advice provided by Iceland’s eminent quality and environmental body, Vakinn. This framework gave us the confidence to build our own Safety Management Plan and Environmental Policy. As Hidden Iceland continued to grow over the years, there was an increasing need to formalise our in-house activities. Therefore, in the summer of 2020, we decided to apply for accreditation with Vakinn, eventually gaining our quality and environmental certificate in December of 2020. It was a lot of work but ultimately worth it, even if many of the criteria had already been met. Simply, taking the time to reflect on ‘how and why we do things’ really helped us streamline operations. This is a prestigious award in Iceland for the tourism sector, not held by many, so to say that the team at Hidden Iceland are honoured by this accolade would be an understatement.
From day one, until now, Hidden Iceland remains 100% Carbon Neutral through sustainable tourism practices and ethical investing with Climate Care and other offsetting bodies.
A few of the ways we maintain a sustainable practice is by reducing our impact when possible. We reuse everything we can, and educate our guests about the effects of climate change. Especially when it comes to the ever melting glaciers of Iceland.
Many of our trips are punctuated by the passion and knowledge of our guides who care very deeply about the environment. These changes are all too apparent on our glacier tours. We hike on glaciers that have lost more ice in the last 20 years than in the previous 150. Physical evidence of the glaciers retreat can be seen clearly as we hike on Sólheimajökull glacier on our South Coast: Fire & Ice trip. The evidence is also easily apparent on Falljökull Glacier within UNESCO World Heritage Site, Vatnajökull National Park, on our Jökulsárlón Glacier Lagoon 2 Day tour.
Below is just a few of the ways in which we try to promote sustainable tourism in Iceland as we grow and explore new areas of the country.
Reduce, Reuse, Recycle
This statements is very often overused and sadly, even more often underperformed. Mainly because it is so hard to quantify and monitor.
Hidden Iceland reduces the impact on the environment from our trips by only using vehicles that are appropriate for the group size and activity. For example, a Mercedes mini-bus for a small group of 12. It’s very disheartening seeing other companies bouncing around in gas guzzling super jeeps while driving on well maintained, flat roads. Aside from the physical cost being transferred to the customer, it is also unnecessarily bad for the environment.
We are also committed to keeping waste at a minimum. No unnecessary printing and adhering to strict recycling rules. We were not happy with other companies managing this for us so in the summer of 2018 we move all cleaning and recycling facilities in-house. This has allowed us to dramatically reduce water usage for vehicle cleaning as well as choosing to only use environmentally friendly chemicals. We take all waste from our customers throughout the trip and transport the sorted recycling straight to the Icelandic recycling centre, Sorpa. No middle man for us anymore. By having our own premises in the up and coming Grandi area we can also hold our inventory/ equipment in a clean and warm environment. This allows us to monitor, repair and reuse all tour specific equipment.
Group management is also key to keeping waste to a minimum. On our Falljökull glacier hike, in the UNESCO Vatnajökull National Park, the first thing we do is talk about preserving what we are seeing that day. A popular phrase in the guiding community is “take only pictures, leave only footprints”. However, the reality is that sticking to assigned paths, understanding the fragility of the flora, and educating the guests about the retreating glaciers, gives our guests a deeper respect for the environment. Hopefully, not just for that day, but from then on out. It’s all too common that our guests will ask very pointed questions following our trips. Usually focussing on ‘what can I do to reduce my impact?’ and ensure sustainability in Iceland is continued back home too. It would seem, simply being a bit conscientious isn’t enough following their trip to Iceland.
Sustainable tourism
Sustainable tourism is again a difficult statement to understand. What is sustainable tourism anyway? It’s just a buzz word right? Well, Hidden Iceland’s mantra covers the definition quite well in my opinion,
Hidden Iceland believe that small groups in appropriate sized vehicles, with educated guides who are well versed in the visited area and who can manage a small group effectively, goes a long way to becoming a sustainable tourism company. Coupled with a 100% carbon neutral stance, a strict waste management policy and Vakinn Certification, we can seek to keep our impact as low as possible.
Ryan Connolly – Environmental Manager, Hidden Iceland
Sadly, individuals and other companies in Iceland do not follow such a basic premise. In fact, watching places in Iceland like the natural hot pools in Mývatn or the waterfall of Brúarafoss be restricted for access due to tourists running a mock gives rises to quotes like ‘Iceland is too crowded’ and it personally pains me to hear it. The reality is, if you flood an area with hundreds of tourists and say, ‘be back in 50 minutes’ you will inevitably destroy the area…one misplaced footstep at a time. That’s why ‘group management’ is so important to our philosophy.
Aside from acting as provisional caretakers of this pristine landscape, our guides delight in sharing their local knowledge too. Picking berries along the paths, naming flowers and expressing their love for Icelandic nature is not a chore and yet it can add so much to the sustainability piece. It turns out, taking care of our environment actually enhances the customer experience.
Educating our guests
We personally take you carefully through some of the most beautiful and pristine places in the country. And we do this with the utmost attention to detail. Educating our guests allows us to keep the area preserved and respected. But it also adds an extra level of immersion to the trip.
To give an example, our Jökulsárlón Glacier Lagoon 2 day tour gives us the incredible chance to stand at the edge of the breath-taking glacier lagoon. It’s often the highlight of the trip for many of our guests. But learning that this wonder of nature happened because climate change rapidly melted the glacier, makes it an even more visceral reaction. Understanding why it’s disappearing creates a sense of wonder and temporary nature to the experience.
A quick lesson for anyone who hasn’t yet joined us. It took close to a thousand years to form the glacier ice you see bobbing up and down in the newly melted ice lagoon. Sadly, the glacier that is shrinking before your eyes is melting the ice at a much fast rate. That means your view will never be the same again. Not even tomorrow. The phrase, beauty is fleeting, holds up here quite well.
Climate change and the glaciers
Even since Hidden Iceland started back in 2017 we’ve seen one of the most popular glaciers lost for guiding, Svínafellsjökull. This is not due to ‘over-use’ but rather a warming climate. This particular glacier, lovingly nicknamed ‘the Hollywood Glacier’, was used in TV shows like Game of Thrones and movies like Batman Begins and Interstellar. The rapidly shrinking glacier has left behind an exposed rock face that is prone to massive landslides. Sadly, this means no more guiding on this glacier.
Disappearing glaciers is sadly a fact that is being repeated across the country, more and more;
Another example is, the documentary Not OK, which was released in 2019, referencing one of Iceland’s glaciers being de-categorised as a glacier due to its diminished size. It has even been renamed from Okjökull (Ok glacier) to simply Ok. You can see where the catchy title came from.
Also, the team at Extreme Ice Survey created the Chasing Ice documentary on climate change which continuously monitors the depletion of glaciers in Iceland and worldwide. This can currently be found on Netflix.
So for a company like ours, that puts such a focus on sustainable tourism in Iceland, specialising in immersive travel onto glaciers and other untouched terrain, it is definitely concerning reading the new report published by the UN. The UN publication states that drastic action is needed to stop this onset of climate change. Estimates say that we have until 2030 to dramatically change how we create energy, consume meals, and run our businesses or it’ll be too late to ‘fix’.
Every day when we step onto one of the remaining glaciers we see climate change in action. The figures vary in terms of depletion but the cold hard fact is that most of the glaciers worldwide are melting at unprecedented speeds.
It’s a scary fact and one that we are careful to educate our guests on. Many people ask if our physical walking on the ice has a major impact in the melting process. It doesn’t. Nothing compared to the warming global temperatures anyway. It’s best to liken our personal impact to ‘walking on the grass’. In fact, the biggest contributing factor to the melting of these glaciers is two fold. Namely, global temperature rises and direct pollution. If we are to compare our personal affect as like ‘walking on the grass’ then the ‘warming temperature’ affect is like digging up the garden with a bulldozer.
The reality is, flying to Iceland has the biggest impact on the glaciers themselves in terms of personal contributions. So our guests again ask, what can they do to reduce their impact? Our answer, though not all encompassing, is often the same;
Reduce, reuse, educate then offset.
Ethical investing
Is all of this enough to truly call ourselves an environmentally conscious company? Possibly. But we wanted to go one step further.
So with the help of the award winning company, Climate Care, we swore to offset every single emission we generate. We’ve reduced as much as we can but zero emissions are impossible while there are still fuel based cars on the roads. For now we’re patiently waiting for technology to make electric mini-buses available and useful to us. Until then, we offset.
Thankfully, most of Iceland’s energy comes from renewable sources already which has helped us keep the offsetting bill a little lower. Dedicating some of our income to go carbon neutral was difficult, especially in the cash poor days when starting the business. However, it was something that meant a lot to us so we made it work. And we’ve managed to maintain neutrality ever since.
What is ethical investing and offsetting?
It’s simple. We used an online calculator from Climate Care following sage advice from the climate care advisors. We then determine how many greenhouse gas emissions our small company creates. Whether that’s from our tours, vehicles or energy consumption.
The funny thing is that the cost to offset all our emissions was staggeringly low (at first). So low in fact that the founders had to contact climate care to confirm they hadn’t made a calculation mistake. These days the price has risen, but then so has our customer base. And we’re still as committed as ever. It made us question why other companies aren’t doing the same. If the price is minuscule then shouldn’t it just be standard practice? So whenever we’re chatting with our customers and that question of ‘what can be done’ creeps up, we can confidently say that offsetting your emissions is an affordable and easy first step.
Climate Care is an investment fund that takes your contribution and invests it into renewable and ethical projects. This was very important to Hidden Iceland as simply donating cash to some unknown cause didn’t seem beneficial or transparent. This year our contributions went directly to initiatives that reduce emissions and improve lives. These include producing efficient cookstoves in Ghana, environmentally sourced safe drinking water in Kenya and wind farms in India.
These projects, among many others create jobs, improve families, protect wildlife, preserve local resources, and fight climate change. Sustainable tourism in Iceland, and the world, also allows all of these benefits to be achieved.
Hidden Iceland is committed to sustainable tourism. Offsetting, educating, and maintaining sustainable practices is a good start. We know that there is still much more we can do. We will always strive to do our best to help tackle climate change and the effects of tourism on the environment.
To offset your own emissions go to Climate Care to calculate your emissions.

The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have been integrated into government policy on social, economic and environmental affairs, with a particular emphasis on building a peaceful and just society, free from fear and violence.
Domestically, the Government aims to identify and better serve marginalized groups in society and to build partnerships to address the large environmental footprint of modern lifestyle. Iceland is still a net contributor to climate change, but heads for carbon-neutrality at the latest in 2040.
Internationally, Iceland shares its expertise in gender equality, land restoration and the use of sustainable natural marine and energy resources through its international cooperation contributing to global progress on SDGs 5, 7, 13, 14 and 15. The promotion of human rights for all, including LGBTI persons, is a cornerstone in Iceland’s foreign policy and its international development cooperation – in line with Agenda 2030 and the Government’s domestic priorities. In particular, Iceland has been a vocal champion of gender equality and the empowerment of women, a key driver for the achievement of the SDGs.
Process
An inter-ministerial working group leads the work of the Icelandic government towards implementing the SDGs. It has mapped Iceland's position for all 169 targets and specified 65 priority targets that will guide the authorities in implementing the goals in the coming years. Data has been gathered for 70 of the indicators for the SDGs which are based on a defined methodology, but more work remains to strengthen the statistical foundation of the SDGs in Iceland.
The SDGs serve as guiding principles in Iceland's development cooperation, as the government’s main goal in development work is to reduce poverty and hunger and to promote general welfare based on gender equality, human rights and sustainable development. New initiatives aim to build public-private partnerships in international development cooperation, as the SDGs will not be met unless the private sector is a part of the solution.
Strong emphasis has been placed on integrating the SDGs into the Government's five-year fiscal strategy. Linking SDG targets directly to specific government policy objectives offers an opportunity to map the means of implementation of specific targets, estimate funding allocation for the SDGs at any given time and anticipate potential synergies and trade-offs. Additionally, efforts are being made to actively involve local authorities in their important role in implementing the 2030 Agenda.
Inclusion
The government acknowledges that implementing the SDGs will require a concerted effort by many different stakeholders. Therefore, the government has focused on consultation and co-operation on the implementation of the goals, both internationally as well as nationally. The Icelandic Youth Council for the SDGs gives young people a platform to express their voice to policy makers. Children have the right to have their views heard and child participation is crucial for the successful implementation of the 2030 Agenda.
Iceland’s VNR report was made available in the government’s electronic consultation portal to invite the opinions of various parties. This feedback was taken into account in writing the final report. Further and more effective consultations with various stakeholders is planned on a regular basis.
Challenges
Iceland is a Nordic welfare state with a relatively high standard of living. For ten consecutive years, Iceland has been ranked both the world's most peaceful country and the one with the greatest gender equality.
Despite real success in many areas, Iceland still faces a variety of challenges and has a way to go before achieving some of the SDG targets. The VNR report attempts to give a clear picture of Iceland's main challenges for each of the 17 goals, with the aim of identifying marginalised groups, such as immigrants and persons with disabilities, in order to leave no groups or individuals behind. Climate change is one of the major challenges in Iceland as well as responsible consumption and production.
The VNR sets out the next phase of Iceland's implementation of the SDGs, including the ambitious Government Action Plan on Climate Change, which is an example of a coordinated policy laid out by seven ministers in consultation with various stakeholders.

In an era when climate change is making it necessary for countries around the world to implement sustainable energy solutions, Iceland presents a unique situation. Today, almost 100 per cent of the electricity consumed in this small country of 330,000 people comes from renewable energy. In addition, 9 out of every 10 houses are heated directly with geothermal energy. The story of Iceland’s transition from fossil fuels may serve as an inspiration to other countries seeking to increase their share of renewable energy. Was Iceland’s transition a special case that is difficult to replicate, or can it be applied as a model for the rest of the world?
Iceland’s energy reality
Iceland is often called “the land of fire and ice”. It is this mixture of geology and northerly location that gives the country its extensive access to renewables. The island lies on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge between the North American and Eurasian tectonic plates, a very active volcanic zone that powers its geothermal systems. Glaciers cover 11 per cent of the country. Seasonal melt feeds glacial rivers, which run from mountains to the sea contributing to Iceland’s hydropower resources. Furthermore, the country has tremendous wind power potential, which remains virtually untapped.
Today, Iceland’s economy, ranging from the provision of heat and electricity for single-family homes to meeting the needs of energy intensive industries, is largely powered by green energy from hydro and geothermal sources. The only exception is a reliance on fossil fuels for transport.
The country’s geothermal energy provides society with numerous benefits other than electricity and district heating. It is widely used to melt snow off sidewalks, heat swimming pools, power fish farming, greenhouse cultivation and food processing, as well as for the production of cosmetics, such as merchandise from Iceland’s famous geothermal spa, the Blue Lagoon.
Iceland’s transition from coal and oil to renewables
While today Iceland is a strong example of how renewable energy can power a modern economy, this has not always been the case. For centuries, utilization of the geothermal resources was limited to washing and bathing, while hydropower production started out in the twentieth century with only a few Megawatts (MW) of power generation. In fact, until the early 1970s, the largest share of the country’s energy consumption was derived from imported fossil fuels. What made this small nation take on this big mission towards renewables?
Despite good intentions, it was not the importance of renewables for climate change that led to this development. The drive behind this transition was simple—Iceland could not sustain oil price fluctuations occurring due to a number of crises affecting world energy markets. It required a stable and economically feasible domestic energy resource for its isolated location on the edge of the Arctic Circle.
The challenging first steps towards Iceland’s renewable developments, both for geothermal and hydropower, were taken by local entrepreneurs. In the early twentieth century, a farmer found a way to use the hot water seeping out of the ground to develop a primitive geothermal heating system for his farm. Municipalities gradually built on his success leading to more systematic exploration of the geothermal resources. Drilling technology, borrowed from the oil industry, allowed deeper drilling for hotter water that could heat more homes. Larger projects were then developed with the implementation of geothermal district heating systems on a commercial scale. Early hydro projects, similar to geothermal, were developed by diligent farmers to provide electricity for their farmhouses, or as a cooperative effort for a few farms. In 1950, 530 such small hydropower plants were built in Iceland, creating scattered independent power systems around the country.
To further incentivize geothermal energy utilization, the Government of Iceland established a geothermal drilling mitigation fund in the late 1960s. The fund loaned money for geothermal research and test drilling, while providing cost recovery for failed projects. The established legal framework also made it attractive for households to connect to the new geothermal district-heating network rather than to continue using fossil fuels.
Simultaneously, Iceland started to focus on large-scale hydropower development, which attracted large international industrial energy users. The goal was to lure new industries to Iceland in order to diversify its economy, create jobs and establish a nationwide power grid.
It was the combination of these developments that created the Iceland of our times.
Was Iceland’s transition a unique case?
While Iceland’s story represents a dramatic change in a relatively short time frame, a logical question is: Does Iceland’s proximity to renewable resources make its transition an exceptional case and one that is difficult to replicate?
In general, a country’s energy mix and consumption patterns are a complex equation. Factors such as cost, resource availability, production efficiency and politics play an important role. Access to renewable resources, be it wind, solar, geothermal or hydro, can promote their use. However, the availability of renewables does not ensure a “green transition”.
In this regard, Iceland’s case was quite unique. Cohesion between municipalities, government and the public to start exploring and exploiting the local green resources was driven by energy costs and the need for energy security. Although Iceland in the 1970s was a small and peaceful State, there were barriers, and success was not assured. At the time, the country was emerging from centuries of poverty and foreign rule, lacking basic infrastructure and knowledge about the potential of its resources, as well as the experience in undertaking major energy projects. In fact, until the 1970s, the United Nations Development Programme classified Iceland as a developing country. Furthermore, Iceland had emerging yet inexperienced institutions to provide the critical financing. The country was, and remains, so sparsely populated that developing an interconnected energy grid was very costly.
These are the same challenges that many countries are facing today while pursuing a sustainable energy path. Nepal, for instance, faces investment and power system challenges in its plan to use some of its untapped hydropower resources. Countries in East Africa, among others, lack the technical know-how to evaluate and harness their vast geothermal resources. Although their circumstances are far from being the same as those in Iceland, much of the nation’s experience can be extrapolated and applied to other countries.
The lessons learned
The essence of Iceland’s experience yields the following advice to current and future “transition makers” as to how to overcome barriers in renewable energy implementation:
- Establish cohesion and collaboration between municipalities, government and the public during early stages of transition. In Iceland, this dialogue fostered trust and a solution-based mindset in overcoming the aforementioned barriers.
- Local empowerment and public engagement is key for success. The way in which municipalities in Iceland engaged and learned from innovative entrepreneurs helped both the geothermal and hydro concept to take off and prove its value.
- A favourable legal and regulatory framework, along with government incentives and support, speeds developments. The Icelandic drilling mitigation fund accelerated the transition by decreasing municipalities’ risks in undertaking geothermal projects.
- Long-term planning for renewable energy implementation, as with any industrial development, is important. Iceland’s later-stage power developments raised questions on how much of its nature should be developed for energy projects. A stakeholder inclusive master plan process around future developments was therefore undertaken.
- Showcasing every step of success is influential. The public participates in a transition that they understand and want. In Iceland, the municipalities that had gained steady access to geothermal hot water became powerful role models for others to do the same. Politicians also used “before and after” photos of the capital area to attract voter’s attention to the cleaner air that was the result of utilizing geothermal resources instead of fossil fuels.
How can Iceland contribute?
While Iceland’s story presents valuable lessons for policymakers, the country has mostly focused on sharing its knowledge through technical expertise in geothermal development.
For decades, Iceland has been involved in geothermal technical assistance and renewable energy education. Over 1,000 experts from around the world have undertaken geothermal courses in Iceland since 1979, through United Nations geothermal training programmes and at higher learning institutions, such as the Iceland School of Energy at Reykjavík University. The Icelandic energy industry has participated in geothermal projects in over 50 countries and continues to be highly active worldwide. An example of such involvement is the construction of the world’s largest geothermal district heating system in China, which serves over 1 million customers.
An interesting aspect of the future of geothermal energy is that recent volcanic activity is by no means a condition for successful direct utilization. Due to technological innovations, widely available low temperature geothermal zones can be developed for space heating and cooling. For instance, few realize that one of Europe’s largest geothermal district heating systems is in Paris. In Europe alone, it is considered that approximately 25 per cent of the population lives in areas suitable for geothermal district heating. For exploring the feasibility and implementation of these and other opportunities around the world, Iceland’s know-how and experience is invaluable.
A meaningful example for the rest of the world
Just as geothermal and hydro power generation made sense for energy transition in Iceland, local conditions elsewhere will determine which renewable resources are the most efficient and how they will be best exploited. Because every country is unique, each transition will be different. Iceland’s conversion is therefore a meaningful success story rather than a “one model for all” approach. First and foremost, Iceland is an inspiring example of what is possible, with many important lessons to share for any country seeking such a transformation.
Iceland’s story is also a reminder that not only rich developed countries have the opportunity to overcome cost and internal barriers for a green transition. Perhaps it may be easier to implement new power solutions where power systems have not yet been fully implemented and stakeholders can be more mobilized to change the status quo.
The good news is that the world has never before been more prepared to undertake the forthcoming change. New and improving technologies are becoming available all the time, as are better funding schemes. Cooperation and sharing of know-how around the globe are becoming increasingly easy and instantaneous. Combining these factors with the many lessons learned in the past, such as from Iceland, will prove to be a powerful tool for countries in achieving a more sustainable path.
Lastly, it is clear that countries around the world, both rich and poor, will need strong leadership at all levels to accomplish the energy transition ahead. These leaders will require meaningful examples to inspire people to action. Committed to further sharing its knowledge and experience, Iceland will proudly take on that role, while continuing to learn, and enthusiastically contributing to our common sustainable future.

The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have been integrated into government policy on social, economic and environmental affairs, with a particular emphasis on building a peaceful and just society, free from fear and violence.
Domestically, the Government aims to identify and better serve marginalized groups in society and to build partnerships to address the large environmental footprint of modern lifestyle. Iceland is still a net contributor to climate change, but heads for carbon-neutrality at the latest in 2040.
Internationally, Iceland shares its expertise in gender equality, land restoration and the use of sustainable natural marine and energy resources through its international cooperation contributing to global progress on SDGs 5, 7, 13, 14 and 15. The promotion of human rights for all, including LGBTI persons, is a cornerstone in Iceland’s foreign policy and its international development cooperation – in line with Agenda 2030 and the Government’s domestic priorities. In particular, Iceland has been a vocal champion of gender equality and the empowerment of women, a key driver for the achievement of the SDGs.
Process
An inter-ministerial working group leads the work of the Icelandic government towards implementing the SDGs. It has mapped Iceland's position for all 169 targets and specified 65 priority targets that will guide the authorities in implementing the goals in the coming years. Data has been gathered for 70 of the indicators for the SDGs which are based on a defined methodology, but more work remains to strengthen the statistical foundation of the SDGs in Iceland.
The SDGs serve as guiding principles in Iceland's development cooperation, as the government’s main goal in development work is to reduce poverty and hunger and to promote general welfare based on gender equality, human rights and sustainable development. New initiatives aim to build public-private partnerships in international development cooperation, as the SDGs will not be met unless the private sector is a part of the solution.
Strong emphasis has been placed on integrating the SDGs into the Government's five-year fiscal strategy. Linking SDG targets directly to specific government policy objectives offers an opportunity to map the means of implementation of specific targets, estimate funding allocation for the SDGs at any given time and anticipate potential synergies and trade-offs. Additionally, efforts are being made to actively involve local authorities in their important role in implementing the 2030 Agenda.
Inclusion
The government acknowledges that implementing the SDGs will require a concerted effort by many different stakeholders. Therefore, the government has focused on consultation and co-operation on the implementation of the goals, both internationally as well as nationally. The Icelandic Youth Council for the SDGs gives young people a platform to express their voice to policy makers. Children have the right to have their views heard and child participation is crucial for the successful implementation of the 2030 Agenda.
Iceland’s VNR report was made available in the government’s electronic consultation portal to invite the opinions of various parties. This feedback was taken into account in writing the final report. Further and more effective consultations with various stakeholders is planned on a regular basis.
Challenges
Iceland is a Nordic welfare state with a relatively high standard of living. For ten consecutive years, Iceland has been ranked both the world's most peaceful country and the one with the greatest gender equality.
Despite real success in many areas, Iceland still faces a variety of challenges and has a way to go before achieving some of the SDG targets. The VNR report attempts to give a clear picture of Iceland's main challenges for each of the 17 goals, with the aim of identifying marginalised groups, such as immigrants and persons with disabilities, in order to leave no groups or individuals behind. Climate change is one of the major challenges in Iceland as well as responsible consumption and production.
The VNR sets out the next phase of Iceland's implementation of the SDGs, including the ambitious Government Action Plan on Climate Change, which is an example of a coordinated policy laid out by seven ministers in consultation with various stakeholders.

While today Iceland is a strong example of how renewable energy can power a modern economy, this has not always been the case. For centuries, utilization of the geothermal resources was limited to washing and bathing, while hydropower production started out in the twentieth century with only a few Megawatts (MW) of power generation. In fact, until the early 1970s, the largest share of the country’s energy consumption was derived from imported fossil fuels. What made this small nation take on this big mission towards renewables?
Despite good intentions, it was not the importance of renewables for climate change that led to this development. The drive behind this transition was simple—Iceland could not sustain oil price fluctuations occurring due to a number of crises affecting world energy markets. It required a stable and economically feasible domestic energy resource for its isolated location on the edge of the Arctic Circle.
The challenging first steps towards Iceland’s renewable developments, both for geothermal and hydropower, were taken by local entrepreneurs. In the early twentieth century, a farmer found a way to use the hot water seeping out of the ground to develop a primitive geothermal heating system for his farm. Municipalities gradually built on his success leading to more systematic exploration of the geothermal resources. Drilling technology, borrowed from the oil industry, allowed deeper drilling for hotter water that could heat more homes. Larger projects were then developed with the implementation of geothermal district heating systems on a commercial scale. Early hydro projects, similar to geothermal, were developed by diligent farmers to provide electricity for their farmhouses, or as a cooperative effort for a few farms. In 1950, 530 such small hydropower plants were built in Iceland, creating scattered independent power systems around the country.
To further incentivize geothermal energy utilization, the Government of Iceland established a geothermal drilling mitigation fund in the late 1960s. The fund loaned money for geothermal research and test drilling, while providing cost recovery for failed projects. The established legal framework also made it attractive for households to connect to the new geothermal district-heating network rather than to continue using fossil fuels.
Simultaneously, Iceland started to focus on large-scale hydropower development, which attracted large international industrial energy users. The goal was to lure new industries to Iceland in order to diversify its economy, create jobs and establish a nationwide power grid.
It was the combination of these developments that created the Iceland of our times.
Was Iceland’s transition a unique case?
While Iceland’s story represents a dramatic change in a relatively short time frame, a logical question is: Does Iceland’s proximity to renewable resources make its transition an exceptional case and one that is difficult to replicate?
In general, a country’s energy mix and consumption patterns are a complex equation. Factors such as cost, resource availability, production efficiency and politics play an important role. Access to renewable resources, be it wind, solar, geothermal or hydro, can promote their use. However, the availability of renewables does not ensure a “green transition”.
In this regard, Iceland’s case was quite unique. Cohesion between municipalities, government and the public to start exploring and exploiting the local green resources was driven by energy costs and the need for energy security. Although Iceland in the 1970s was a small and peaceful State, there were barriers, and success was not assured. At the time, the country was emerging from centuries of poverty and foreign rule, lacking basic infrastructure and knowledge about the potential of its resources, as well as the experience in undertaking major energy projects. In fact, until the 1970s, the United Nations Development Programme classified Iceland as a developing country. Furthermore, Iceland had emerging yet inexperienced institutions to provide the critical financing. The country was, and remains, so sparsely populated that developing an interconnected energy grid was very costly.
These are the same challenges that many countries are facing today while pursuing a sustainable energy path. Nepal, for instance, faces investment and power system challenges in its plan to use some of its untapped hydropower resources. Countries in East Africa, among others, lack the technical know-how to evaluate and harness their vast geothermal resources. Although their circumstances are far from being the same as those in Iceland, much of the nation’s experience can be extrapolated and applied to other countries.
The lessons learned
The essence of Iceland’s experience yields the following advice to current and future “transition makers” as to how to overcome barriers in renewable energy implementation:
- Establish cohesion and collaboration between municipalities, government and the public during early stages of transition. In Iceland, this dialogue fostered trust and a solution-based mindset in overcoming the aforementioned barriers.
- Local empowerment and public engagement is key for success. The way in which municipalities in Iceland engaged and learned from innovative entrepreneurs helped both the geothermal and hydro concept to take off and prove its value.
- A favourable legal and regulatory framework, along with government incentives and support, speeds developments. The Icelandic drilling mitigation fund accelerated the transition by decreasing municipalities’ risks in undertaking geothermal projects.
- Long-term planning for renewable energy implementation, as with any industrial development, is important. Iceland’s later-stage power developments raised questions on how much of its nature should be developed for energy projects. A stakeholder inclusive master plan process around future developments was therefore undertaken.
- Showcasing every step of success is influential. The public participates in a transition that they understand and want. In Iceland, the municipalities that had gained steady access to geothermal hot water became powerful role models for others to do the same. Politicians also used “before and after” photos of the capital area to attract voter’s attention to the cleaner air that was the result of utilizing geothermal resources instead of fossil fuels.
How can Iceland contribute?
While Iceland’s story presents valuable lessons for policymakers, the country has mostly focused on sharing its knowledge through technical expertise in geothermal development.
For decades, Iceland has been involved in geothermal technical assistance and renewable energy education. Over 1,000 experts from around the world have undertaken geothermal courses in Iceland since 1979, through United Nations geothermal training programmes and at higher learning institutions, such as the Iceland School of Energy at Reykjavík University. The Icelandic energy industry has participated in geothermal projects in over 50 countries and continues to be highly active worldwide. An example of such involvement is the construction of the world’s largest geothermal district heating system in China, which serves over 1 million customers.
An interesting aspect of the future of geothermal energy is that recent volcanic activity is by no means a condition for successful direct utilization. Due to technological innovations, widely available low temperature geothermal zones can be developed for space heating and cooling. For instance, few realize that one of Europe’s largest geothermal district heating systems is in Paris. In Europe alone, it is considered that approximately 25 per cent of the population lives in areas suitable for geothermal district heating. For exploring the feasibility and implementation of these and other opportunities around the world, Iceland’s know-how and experience is invaluable.
A meaningful example for the rest of the world
Just as geothermal and hydro power generation made sense for energy transition in Iceland, local conditions elsewhere will determine which renewable resources are the most efficient and how they will be best exploited. Because every country is unique, each transition will be different. Iceland’s conversion is therefore a meaningful success story rather than a “one model for all” approach. First and foremost, Iceland is an inspiring example of what is possible, with many important lessons to share for any country seeking such a transformation.
Iceland’s story is also a reminder that not only rich developed countries have the opportunity to overcome cost and internal barriers for a green transition. Perhaps it may be easier to implement new power solutions where power systems have not yet been fully implemented and stakeholders can be more mobilized to change the status quo.
The good news is that the world has never before been more prepared to undertake the forthcoming change. New and improving technologies are becoming available all the time, as are better funding schemes. Cooperation and sharing of know-how around the globe are becoming increasingly easy and instantaneous. Combining these factors with the many lessons learned in the past, such as from Iceland, will prove to be a powerful tool for countries in achieving a more sustainable path.
Lastly, it is clear that countries around the world, both rich and poor, will need strong leadership at all levels to accomplish the energy transition ahead. These leaders will require meaningful examples to inspire people to action. Committed to further sharing its knowledge and experience, Iceland will proudly take on that role, while continuing to learn, and enthusiastically contributing to our common sustainable future.

Reykjavík, Hið íslenska bókmenntafélag. . Iceland is fully committed to implementing Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development both nationally and internationally. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have been integrated into government policy on social, economic and environmental affairs, with a particular emphasis on building a peaceful and just society, free from fear and violence.
Domestically, the Government aims to identify and better serve marginalized groups in society and to build partnerships to address the large environmental footprint of modern lifestyle. Iceland is still a net contributor to climate change, but heads for carbon-neutrality at the latest in 2040.
Internationally, Iceland shares its expertise in gender equality, land restoration and the use of sustainable natural marine and energy resources through its international cooperation contributing to global progress on SDGs 5, 7, 13, 14 and 15. The promotion of human rights for all, including LGBTI persons, is a cornerstone in Iceland’s foreign policy and its international development cooperation – in line with Agenda 2030 and the Government’s domestic priorities. In particular, Iceland has been a vocal champion of gender equality and the empowerment of women, a key driver for the achievement of the SDGs.
Process
An inter-ministerial working group leads the work of the Icelandic government towards implementing the SDGs. It has mapped Iceland's position for all 169 targets and specified 65 priority targets that will guide the authorities in implementing the goals in the coming years. Data has been gathered for 70 of the indicators for the SDGs which are based on a defined methodology, but more work remains to strengthen the statistical foundation of the SDGs in Iceland.
The SDGs serve as guiding principles in Iceland's development cooperation, as the government’s main goal in development work is to reduce poverty and hunger and to promote general welfare based on gender equality, human rights and sustainable development. New initiatives aim to build public-private partnerships in international development cooperation, as the SDGs will not be met unless the private sector is a part of the solution.
Strong emphasis has been placed on integrating the SDGs into the Government's five-year fiscal strategy. Linking SDG targets directly to specific government policy objectives offers an opportunity to map the means of implementation of specific targets, estimate funding allocation for the SDGs at any given time and anticipate potential synergies and trade-offs. Additionally, efforts are being made to actively involve local authorities in their important role in implementing the 2030 Agenda.
Inclusion
The government acknowledges that implementing the SDGs will require a concerted effort by many different stakeholders. Therefore, the government has focused on consultation and co-operation on the implementation of the goals, both internationally as well as nationally. The Icelandic Youth Council for the SDGs gives young people a platform to express their voice to policy makers. Children have the right to have their views heard and child participation is crucial for the successful implementation of the 2030 Agenda.
Iceland’s VNR report was made available in the government’s electronic consultation portal to invite the opinions of various parties. This feedback was taken into account in writing the final report. Further and more effective consultations with various stakeholders is planned on a regular basis.
Challenges
Iceland is a Nordic welfare state with a relatively high standard of living. For ten consecutive years, Iceland has been ranked both the world's most peaceful country and the one with the greatest gender equality.
Despite real success in many areas, Iceland still faces a variety of challenges and has a way to go before achieving some of the SDG targets. The VNR report attempts to give a clear picture of Iceland's main challenges for each of the 17 goals, with the aim of identifying marginalised groups, such as immigrants and persons with disabilities, in order to leave no groups or individuals behind. Climate change is one of the major challenges in Iceland as well as responsible consumption and production.
The VNR sets out the next phase of Iceland's implementation of the SDGs, including the ambitious Government Action Plan on Climate Change, which is an example of a coordinated policy laid out by seven ministers in consultation with various stakeholders.

In an era when climate change is making it necessary for countries around the world to implement sustainable energy solutions, Iceland presents a unique situation. Today, almost 100 per cent of the electricity consumed in this small country of 330,000 people comes from renewable energy. In addition, 9 out of every 10 houses are heated directly with geothermal energy. The story of Iceland’s transition from fossil fuels may serve as an inspiration to other countries seeking to increase their share of renewable energy. Was Iceland’s transition a special case that is difficult to replicate, or can it be applied as a model for the rest of the world?
Iceland’s energy reality
Iceland is often called “the land of fire and ice”. It is this mixture of geology and northerly location that gives the country its extensive access to renewables. The island lies on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge between the North American and Eurasian tectonic plates, a very active volcanic zone that powers its geothermal systems. Glaciers cover 11 per cent of the country. Seasonal melt feeds glacial rivers, which run from mountains to the sea contributing to Iceland’s hydropower resources. Furthermore, the country has tremendous wind power potential, which remains virtually untapped.
Today, Iceland’s economy, ranging from the provision of heat and electricity for single-family homes to meeting the needs of energy intensive industries, is largely powered by green energy from hydro and geothermal sources. The only exception is a reliance on fossil fuels for transport.
The country’s geothermal energy provides society with numerous benefits other than electricity and district heating. It is widely used to melt snow off sidewalks, heat swimming pools, power fish farming, greenhouse cultivation and food processing, as well as for the production of cosmetics, such as merchandise from Iceland’s famous geothermal spa, the Blue Lagoon.

The good news is that the world has never before been more prepared to undertake the forthcoming change. New and improving technologies are becoming available all the time, as are better funding schemes. Cooperation and sharing of know-how around the globe are becoming increasingly easy and instantaneous. Combining these factors with the many lessons learned in the past, such as from Iceland, will prove to be a powerful tool for countries in achieving a more sustainable path.
Lastly, it is clear that countries around the world, both rich and poor, will need strong leadership at all levels to accomplish the energy transition ahead. These leaders will require meaningful examples to inspire people to action. Committed to further sharing its knowledge and experience, Iceland will proudly take on that role, while continuing to learn, and enthusiastically contributing to our common sustainable future.

Reykjavík, Hið íslenska bókmenntafélag. . Iceland is fully committed to implementing Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development both nationally and internationally. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have been integrated into government policy on social, economic and environmental affairs, with a particular emphasis on building a peaceful and just society, free from fear and violence.
Domestically, the Government aims to identify and better serve marginalized groups in society and to build partnerships to address the large environmental footprint of modern lifestyle. Iceland is still a net contributor to climate change, but heads for carbon-neutrality at the latest in 2040.
Internationally, Iceland shares its expertise in gender equality, land restoration and the use of sustainable natural marine and energy resources through its international cooperation contributing to global progress on SDGs 5, 7, 13, 14 and 15. The promotion of human rights for all, including LGBTI persons, is a cornerstone in Iceland’s foreign policy and its international development cooperation – in line with Agenda 2030 and the Government’s domestic priorities. In particular, Iceland has been a vocal champion of gender equality and the empowerment of women, a key driver for the achievement of the SDGs.
Process
An inter-ministerial working group leads the work of the Icelandic government towards implementing the SDGs. It has mapped Iceland's position for all 169 targets and specified 65 priority targets that will guide the authorities in implementing the goals in the coming years. Data has been gathered for 70 of the indicators for the SDGs which are based on a defined methodology, but more work remains to strengthen the statistical foundation of the SDGs in Iceland.
The SDGs serve as guiding principles in Iceland's development cooperation, as the government’s main goal in development work is to reduce poverty and hunger and to promote general welfare based on gender equality, human rights and sustainable development. New initiatives aim to build public-private partnerships in international development cooperation, as the SDGs will not be met unless the private sector is a part of the solution.
Strong emphasis has been placed on integrating the SDGs into the Government's five-year fiscal strategy. Linking SDG targets directly to specific government policy objectives offers an opportunity to map the means of implementation of specific targets, estimate funding allocation for the SDGs at any given time and anticipate potential synergies and trade-offs. Additionally, efforts are being made to actively involve local authorities in their important role in implementing the 2030 Agenda.
Inclusion
The government acknowledges that implementing the SDGs will require a concerted effort by many different stakeholders. Therefore, the government has focused on consultation and co-operation on the implementation of the goals, both internationally as well as nationally. The Icelandic Youth Council for the SDGs gives young people a platform to express their voice to policy makers. Children have the right to have their views heard and child participation is crucial for the successful implementation of the 2030 Agenda.
Iceland’s VNR report was made available in the government’s electronic consultation portal to invite the opinions of various parties. This feedback was taken into account in writing the final report. Further and more effective consultations with various stakeholders is planned on a regular basis.
Challenges
Iceland is a Nordic welfare state with a relatively high standard of living. For ten consecutive years, Iceland has been ranked both the world's most peaceful country and the one with the greatest gender equality.
Despite real success in many areas, Iceland still faces a variety of challenges and has a way to go before achieving some of the SDG targets. The VNR report attempts to give a clear picture of Iceland's main challenges for each of the 17 goals, with the aim of identifying marginalised groups, such as immigrants and persons with disabilities, in order to leave no groups or individuals behind. Climate change is one of the major challenges in Iceland as well as responsible consumption and production.
The VNR sets out the next phase of Iceland's implementation of the SDGs, including the ambitious Government Action Plan on Climate Change, which is an example of a coordinated policy laid out by seven ministers in consultation with various stakeholders.

huffpost,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/sustainable-tourism-lesso_b_12564044 ,"Last week I had the pleasure of speaking at the PM4SD (Project Management For Sustainable Development) Conference in Akureyri, Iceland. Akureyri only has a little less than 18,000 residents but is the fourth largest town outside of Reykjavik, and the largest town not near the capital. Locals call it the capital of the North.
Akureyri was selected in part because it was the recipient of the #1 Europe Destination in 2015 by Lonely Planet who said:
""Akureyri, in contrast, sits on the north coast under snowcapped peaks at the head of Iceland's longest fjord. It's Iceland's second biggest urban area, and while you shouldn't expect a big-city vibe (the population is only 18,000), this easy-going place has more buzz than anywhere outside of Reykjavík. It's also a great base for exploring the north's green pastures, fishing villages, mudpots, waterfalls, ski fields and whale-filled bays. Signs of the earth's power - glaciers, volcanoes, lava fields and stacks of basalt - are everywhere, while strange underwater features lure divers and offshore islands are home to colonies of seabirds.""
Iceland has become a global leader in renewable energy and greenhouse gas reduction. Geothermal and hydro meet 81% of Iceland's primary energy needs for electricity, heat, and transportation.
Reykjavik, where 40% of Iceland's residents live, has set a goal of being entirely free of fossil fuels by 2050. Geothermal energy powers all buildings in the city. This heats the homes, lights the streets, and powers the greenhouses that produce most of the vegetables. It also heats the popular outdoor pools popular for swimming and bathing year round by locals and tourists alike. Only around 0.1% of Iceland's electricity is generated using fossil fuels.
It was from this backdrop, that the PM4SD conference offered some valuable lessons for sustainable development in general and sustainable tourism more specifically.
PM4SD brought together a wide diversity of panelists from government, academia and the private sector. The conference opened with an enthusiastic presentation from the Ms. Olof Yrr Atladottir, Director General Icelandic Tourism Board, who spoke proudly of the nations 99% electricity coming from renewables and there current exploration with companies like Tesla to make their transportation more renewable as well.
Silvia Barbone, the executive director of PM4SD and chief organizer of the conference framed the conference beautifully as an opportunity to build on existing sustainable development management knowledge and sustainable tourism best practices to create the future that we wan.
One panel featured representatives from the UNTWO, UNEP, and the World Bank and was moderated by local TV News personality Hilda Jana Gisladottir. Some key points included:
- Chris Imbsen from the UNWTO reminded us of the power of the tourism industry with it accounting for 10% of the worlds GDP, one out eleven jobs, and being the third largest export, behind fuels and chemicals but ahead of food. Chris also shared an inspirational video on the opportunity for all to participate in the UN Year for Sustainable Tourism for Development.
- Deirdre Shurland, senior consultant at UNEP discussed the opportunities for tourism to respond to the challenges of low carbon development, monitoring and measuring, resilience, quality tourism services, and resource efficiency.
- Shaun Mann - World Bank - Senior Tourism Specialist, spoke of the biggest challenges being political economy around the tourism sector, governance: national / local, social and economic inclusion, and in-country capacity / infrastructure. He suggested the need to use a ""whole government approach"" that would bring together national, regional, and local champions along with public private dialogues to create quick wins to gain necessary momentum.
In another panel Rob Holmes spoke of the power of story telling in connecting people with nature and promoting sustainable destinations.
My own presentation presented our Blue Community model that suggests we move beyond the traditional sustainable tourism model of balancing social, economic, and environmental concerns to a new model that would take into account the four pillars of the GSTC (Global Sustainable Tourism Council) and operate with just and sustainable economic development, create a safe and just space for humanity, within the limitations of the science of planetary boundaries.
Some of the key lessons were found in the PM4SD excursions. On these trips we learned the importance of sustainable fishing, the ability of local people to protect and preserve their cultural and historical heritage, the value of mass transportation, the opportunities of featuring natural resources, and the treasure to be found in connecting people with nature in a sustainable manner. Some examples included:
1. Preserving Cultural Heritage. Siglufjordur, Iceland is the most northern town in Iceland. It is less than 30 miles from the Arctic Cirlce, and is a historic fishing village. The small town has a number of museums and galleries, the most famous of which is the award-winning Herring Era Museum.
The small town of only about 1200 people was quite impressive on how the local people were creative and resilient to turn around a decline town following the collapse of the herring fishing industry. The town has developed a tourism industry through development of a small conference center with a building for meetings, a restaurant, and coffee shop. Volunteers have built a fantastic fishing museum telling the story of the herring industry. Opportunities for tourism also now includes fishing and hiking, and the wonderful hospitality of the local people.
The town in the 1950's had about 3000 people when herring was king of the fishing industry. Although warnings were given, about overfishing the warnings were not heeded until to late and the result was that the industry collapsed.
The town has learned the valuable lessons of sustainable fishing practices and the role that tourism can play to diversify an economy.
Part of the lesson is the importance that preserving a community's unique cultural heritage can have in both bringing a community together, and providing a new resource for attracting tourists. Although Siglufjordur is a small town, The Herring Era Museum is the largest maritime museum in Iceland and has won the European Museum Award.
2. Packaging Natural Resources. - A trip to Godafoss ""Waterfall of the Gods"", the Myvatn Nature Baths, and the Dettifos waterfall was a lesson in how different natural resources can be packaged into an exciting tourism program while at the same time providing incentive to protect the natural world.
Our first stop was Godafoss ""Waterfall of the Gods"", one of the most spectacular waterfalls of Iceland. It received its name from Þorgeir Ljósvetningagoði, a local ruler around 1000 A.D. who made Christianity the official religion of Iceland. He then threw his Norse God Statues into the water fall thus giving it the name Godafoss meaning ""Waterfall of the Gods"".
Following our trip to Godafoss we relaxed and played in the in the Myvatn Nature Baths. The baths are a human made creation utilizing the National Power Company's bore hole for the supply of water. The bath has a scenic overview of the landscape where guests can swim or bathe in 97 to 104 degree water and relax in the pool with the scenic views.
The lesson is that we can utilize existing resources to partner with the natural environment to create new and sustainable attractions for locals and visitors alike.
We then traveled to the Dettifos Waterfall in Vatnajökull National Park. After a short and pleasant hike we arrived at an overlook where we realized that Godafoss was just a warm-up when it comes to viewing spectacular waterfalls.
Detifoss is the most powerful waterfall in Europe with a height of 45 meters (150 ft) and about 100 metres (330 ft) wide. The water volume is about 500 cubic meters of water per second, the most powerful in all Europe
The lesson was the importance of preserving and protecting our natural environment. The Vatnajökull National Park is a relatively new national park, established in June 2008. It has since expanded and now the second largest national park in Europe, and covers 14% of Iceland. Iceland has three National Parks and a strong foundation for continuing to increase its tourist base through this national protection.
3. Making Tourism Attractions Carbon Neutral - Our last stop on the day's tour was in Husavik, where we were treated to a carbon neutral whale watching trip provided by North Sailing. North Sailing is working to become more sustainable in every action it takes. Some of the ways they are doing this include:
- Setting a goal to become totally carbon neutral by 2020 using electric propulsion on day tours and hybrid regenerative systems and second hand bio diesel on expeditions where possible
For example sound travels more than four times faster in water than air and the noise from large vessels can carry long distances and impact and disrupt whales in important feeding grounds. North Sailings use of wooden sailing boats with slow propellers that operate at slow speeds makes this whale watching virtually noise free.
North Sailing advertises itself as ""Pioneers in Sustainable Tourism"". From what I saw and experienced, I would have to agree. Hopefully they will be a model that others will follow.
In summary, Iceland is a good case study for others who are beginning the process of transforming from old unsustainable models to new ones.
For sustainable tourism they provide good examples of best practices for preserving cultural heritage for tourism, protecting natural resources and packaging them for the visitor, and transforming a whale watching tour business to become carbon neutral and more sustainable.
I look forward to returning to Iceland again to explore and learn more.

Going digital, ensuring safety
Because the opportunity to advance women’s leadership in this symbolic and challenging year cannot be underestimated and neither can our commitment to creating an inclusive convening moment, we have made the decision to transform the Forum to ensure global conversations.
While we will all miss the icy wind and Northern Lights of Iceland, this decision allows us to ensure the safety of the Reykjavík Global Forum community.
Together with our Icelandic co-hosts, we are thrilled to announce the opportunity “to be together in Iceland” in spirit while we cannot in person. This will be made possible through the “Reykjavík Satellites”; small, local gatherings co-hosted by Icelandic embassies and consulates around the world. These events, which will adhere to local health and safety guidelines, will all have the same programme and play an important part in the wider, global programme.
Conversationists of the digital gathering, will be joined by participants of the Reykjavík Satellites and jointly contribute to the overall Forum outcome: the Reykjavik Manual.
New to the Forum this year, the Manual will gather the insights, best practices, and solutions offered by women leaders around the world in a practical guide on how to ‘build back better’.
ICELAND: THE GLOBAL CHAMPION OF EQUALITY BETWEEN WOMEN AND MEN
The Reykjavík Global Forum takes place in Iceland. For many years Iceland has been the global champion in the WEF’s Global Gender Gap Report which examines disparities between men and women in terms of political empowerment, economic opportunity, education and health.
milestones that matter:
4 things that made the difference
Equal Parental Leave
9 Months (3 for women, 3 for men and 3 to share). A combination of guaranteed daycare and parental leave allows women to continue working post-children. Over several years, men taking parental leave is up to 90%.
Equal Pay Law
On 1 June 2017, Iceland passed an instrumental law requiring proof from all Icelandic companies that they are paying men and women equally for doing the same job.
Strong Female Role Models and Women in Power
47% of MP’s are women, over 65% of members in local governments are women; over 65% of university students of women; 80% of women participate in the labour market.
Consensus From Left to Right
Icelandic women have, in most cases, agreed upon the greatest gender equality steps taken, across party lines. . ",False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False
oecd,http://www.oecd.org/environment/country-reviews/Iceland%20Highlights%20web6.pdf http://www.oecd.org/environment/iceland2014.htm ," . Iceland has one of the world’s most pristine natural environments and its glaciers, volcanoes and hot underground springs bring major economic benefits via renewable energy and tourism. Continued growth in power generation for aluminium smelting and in tourist numbers must be managed carefully to preserve these natural assets.
This is the third OECD review of Iceland’s environmental performance. It provides Iceland’s policy makers with a wide-ranging assessment of environmental progress and policies.
Iceland has a very small, open economy, built on plentiful and cheap renewable energy, aluminium industry, tourism and fishing. Its 324,000 people enjoy a high standard of living and a good environment, with excellent water quality, low air pollution and easy access to uncontaminated nature.
The deep recession sparked by the 2008 financial crisis reduced some pressures on the environment, but also affected the resources available for environmental programmes and related infrastructure investment. At the same time, it spurred interest in the transition towards a greener economy.
The natural environment is a key asset for Iceland’s recovery: it provides abundant hydro and geothermal energy reserves, as well as the pristine wilderness and spectacular landscapes that attract thousands of tourists every year.
Opportunities
A sound policy framework for environmental management and sustainable development.
Innovative policy approaches to managing natural resources such as fish and renewable energy sources.
A long tradition of public participation in decision making.
Historically low levels of air and water pollution.
A unique natural environment, with pristine wilderness, hot springs, lava fields and glaciers, which attracted more than 600,000 visitors in 2000.
A very low-carbon energy mix, with the highest share of renewables in the OECD.
Challenges
Financial constraints and insufficient local administrative capacity to implement environmental policy.
An unbalanced industrial structure that relies heavily on cheap, clean electricity to power energy-intensive industry.
A legacy of acute soil erosion, worsened today by subsidies that encourage overgrazing.
Growing and highly seasonal tourist arrivals, which exert pressures on fragile ecosystems and infrastructure designed for a small population.
Potential land-use conflicts between renewable power development and nature-based tourism.
Lack of viable alternatives to road transport for domestic passengers and freight. . ",False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False
