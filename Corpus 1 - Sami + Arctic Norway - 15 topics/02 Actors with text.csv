financial wealth for future generations
The aim of the oil fund is to ensure responsible and long-term management of revenue from Norway’s oil and gas resources in the North Sea so that this wealth benefits both current and future generations. The fund’s formal name is the Government Pension Fund Global.
The fund has a small stake in more than 9,000 companies worldwide, including the likes of Apple, Nestlé, Microsoft and Samsung. On average, the fund holds 1.4 percent of all of the world’s listed companies.
The Norwegian oil fund is one of the world's largest funds. Investments are spread across most markets, countries and currencies to achieve broad exposure to global growth and value creation, and ensure good risk diversification.
Most of the fund is invested in equities, which are ownership interests in companies. Another part is invested in bonds, which are a type of loan to governments and companies, and a final slice is invested in real estate and infrastructure for renewable energy.
Search in all of the fund’s investments by country, asset class and sector. This information is updated annually and is available for every year since our first investment in 1998.
The fund exists to help finance the Norwegian welfare state for future generations. The future value of the fund depends on sustainable growth, well-functioning markets and value creation at the companies we invest in.
Returns on the fund’s investments account for the biggest part of the fund's market value. Inflows from the government make up 3,092 billion kroner of the value. Fluctuations in the krone lie behind the remainder.
The fund's market value is affected by investment returns, capital inflow and withdrawals, and exchange rate movements.
Since 1998 the fund has generated an annual return of 6.3 percent, or 6,427 billion kroner.
The fund’s investment decisions are based on research and analysis of the developments in financial markets and the global economy. We share internal research and analysis as well as content from conferences or seminars. We invite to dialogue and have a strong collaboration with academics, peers and practitioners with an aim to improving the investment strategy and our results.
Internal active equity management has enabled the fund to develop investment strategies tailored to its characteristics. Today, we publish an historic review of the fund’s more than 20 years’ experience in this area.
In the first quarter of 2021, the Government Pension Fund Global returned 4.0 percent, equivalent to 382 billion kroner.

Indicator Assessment
Cumulative specific net mass balance of European glaciers
Projected change in the volume of mountain glaciers and ice caps in European glaciated regions
Past trends
A general loss of glacier mass since the beginning of the measurements has occurred in all European glacier regions, except some glaciers in Norway (Figure 1). The Alps have lost roughly 50 % of their ice mass since 1900 [i]. Norwegian coastal glaciers were expanding and gaining mass up to the end of the 1990s owing to increased winter snowfall on the North Atlantic Coast; now these glaciers are also retreating [ii]. Some ice caps at higher elevations in north-eastern Svalbard, Norway, seem to be increasing in thickness, but estimates for Svalbard as a whole show a declining mass balance [iii]. The centennial retreat of European glaciers is attributed primarily to increased summer temperatures. However, changes in winter precipitation, reduced glacier albedo due to the lack of summer snowfall and various other feedback processes, such as the increasing debris cover on the glacier, can influence the behaviour of glaciers, in particular on regional and decadal scales.
The melting of glaciers is contributing significantly to global sea level rise. For the period 2003–2009, the global contribution was 0.71 ± 0.08 mm per year, accounting for 29 ± 13 % of the observed sea level rise [iv].
Projections
The retreat of European glaciers is projected to continue throughout the 21st century (Figure 2). One study estimates that the volume of European glaciers will decline between 22 and 84 % relative to their extent in 2006 under a moderate greenhouse gas forcing scenario (RCP4.5) and between 38 and 89 % under a high forcing scenario (RCP8.5) (all European regions combined) [v]. The relative volume loss is largest in central Europe (83 ± 10 % for RCP4.5 and 95 ± 4 % for RCP8.5). Similar results were achieved in other studies [vi]. In Norway, nearly all smaller glaciers are projected to disappear and, overall, glacier area as well as volume may be reduced by about one-third by 2100, even under the low SRES B2 emissions scenario [vii].

In April 2013, the European Commission (EC) presented the EU Adaptation Strategy Package. This package consists of the EU Strategy on adaptation to climate change (COM/2013/216 final) and a number of supporting documents. The overall aim of the EU Adaptation Strategy is to contribute to a more climate-resilient Europe.
One of the objectives of the EU Adaptation Strategy is Better informed decision-making, which will be achieved by bridging the knowledge gap and further developing the European climate adaptation platform (Climate-ADAPT) as the ‘one-stop shop’ for adaptation information in Europe. Climate-ADAPT has been developed jointly by the EC and the EEA to share knowledge on (1) observed and projected climate change and its impacts on environmental and social systems and on human health, (2) relevant research, (3) EU, transnational, national and subnational adaptation strategies and plans, and (4) adaptation case studies.
Further objectives include Promoting adaptation in key vulnerablesectors through climate-proofing EU sector policies and Promoting action by Member States. Most EU Member States have already adopted national adaptation strategies and many have also prepared action plans on climate change adaptation. The EC also supports adaptation in cities through the Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy initiative.
In September 2016, the EC presented an indicative roadmap for the evaluation of the EU Adaptation Strategy by 2018.
In November 2013, the European Parliament and the European Council adopted the 7th EU Environment Action Programme (7th EAP) to 2020, ‘Living well, within the limits of our planet’. The 7th EAP is intended to help guide EU action on environment and climate change up to and beyond 2020. It highlights that ‘Action to mitigate and adapt to climate change will increase the resilience of the Union’s economy and society, while stimulating innovation and protecting the Union’s natural resources.’ Consequently, several priority objectives of the 7th EAP refer to climate change adaptation.
No targets have been specified.
Various methods are used to estimate mass balances. A literature overview can be found under http://wgms.ch/data_guidelines/.
Projections of volume changes are based on melt in response to transient, spatially differentiated twenty-first century projections of temperature and precipitation from ten global climate models.

Data on the cryosphere vary significantly with regard to availability and quality. Snow and ice cover have been monitored globally since satellite measurements started in the 1970s. Improved technology allows for more detailed observations and observations of a higher resolution. High-quality long-term data are also available on glaciers throughout Europe.
Continuous efforts are being made to improve knowledge of the cryosphere. Scenarios for the future development of key components of the cryosphere have recently become available from the CMIP5 project, which has provided climate change projections for the IPCC AR5. Owing to their economic importance, considerable efforts have also been devoted to improving real-time monitoring of snow cover and sea ice.

A safe, stable, sustainable and prosperous Arctic is important not just for the region itself, but for the EU and the rest of the world. While the Arctic region is rich in resources both on land and in the seas, the Arctic faces several challenges due among other things to its sparse population, limited logistical networks, and fragile environmental conditions.
The inhabitants of the Arctic are familiar with these conditions – however harsh they may seem to people living in lower latitudes – and have socio-economic aspirations for sustainable development under Arctic conditions. The indigenous peoples who have lived in various parts of this vast region for millennia have specific traditional knowledge and across the Arctic region, several forms of traditional livelihoods have developed over the centuries, not least reindeer herding, fishing, and hunting. As modern life has increasingly taken hold in Arctic regions, other forms of economic activity and technologies have been added. These include public administration and education, more intensive fishing, maritime and shipping operations, resource extraction, research activities, tourism, telecommunications etc.
The Arctic region attracts increasing interest from economic and civil society within each Arctic state as well as from many other parts of the world.
The EU is committed to implementing the United Nations (UN) 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development to achieve sustainable development in its three dimensions – economic, social and environmental – in a balanced and integrated manner. Several EU activities taking place in and relating to the Arctic region should contribute to the achievement of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
In order to support socio-economic activities taking place in the Arctic regions, Arctic infrastructure and logistics play an important role as enabling factors. These sectors also have strong growth potential, as well as environmental impacts and social implications in their own right.
The Commission Directorate-General for Regional and Urban Policy (DG Regio) and Directorate-General for Mobility and Transport (DG Move) are leading EU work to increase infrastructure capacity and improve transport connectivity in the Arctic. Depending on the context, the EU can support activities in these sectors, thereby contributing to increasing productivity and improving trade between the Arctic and the EU. It remains important to pay due attention to increased environmental impacts as well as positive and/or potentially adverse implications for social cohesion and mobility.
Infrastructure
The EU Cohesion Policy 2014-2020 supports Arctic investments and capacity building.
The Investment Plan for Europe supports various infrastructure projects in the European Arctic, including Greenland.
Increasing infrastructure capacity and transport connectivity contributes to 'building resilient infrastructure, promoting sustainable industrialization and fostering innovation' (UN Sustainable Development Goal 9).
The EU’s environment policies promote the transformation towards an inclusive green economy that balances environmental considerations with growth, creates jobs and helps reduce poverty through sustainable management of natural capital. Resource efficiency, ecosystem resilience and human well-being are three crucial factors needed to find the balance between development and sustainability.
The Commission Directorate-General for Environment (DG Env) together with the European Environment Agency (EEA) leads EU work on environmental matters, including the promotion of the green economy.
Further information on EU work to safeguard the Arctic environment can be found on the Climate Change and the Arctic Environment subpage.
Using innovation
To protect the environment and make EU industry more competitive, we need technologies, processes and business models that use resources more efficiently. We call these solutions 'eco-innovation'. The EU supports green technology and green products through a range of funding schemes and policies (non-exhaustive list):
Resource efficiency
Europe 2020, the EU's growth strategy, aims to make the EU a smart, sustainable and inclusive economy. This includes encouraging the use of resources, such as water, minerals and timber, in a more sustainable way. One of the building blocks of this initiative is the Roadmap to a Resource-Efficient Europe.
Sustainable consumption and production
Sustainable consumption and production maximises business' potential to transform environmental challenges into economic opportunities and provide a better deal for consumers. A range of EU and national policies foster resource efficient and eco-friendly products and raise consumer awareness. Notably, the Sustainable Consumption and Production Action Plan aims to improve the environmental performance of products and increase the demand for more sustainable goods and production technologies.
Preventing and managing waste
In order to promote the sustainable use of resources in the Arctic, the EU will share experiences and best practices on the circular economy with Arctic states.
Managing water resources
Access to good quality water and having a healthy marine environment are essential for people, nature and economic activities. The EU's Water Framework Directive aims to ensure good quality water around the EU by managing river basin systems in a coordinated way at regional and national levels.
Encouraging a move towards the green economy in the ways described above contributes to 'ensuring sustainable consumption and production patterns' (UN Sustainable Development Goal 12).
The Commission Directorate-General for Maritime Affairs and Fisheries (DG Mare), Directorate-General for Mobility and Transport (DG Move) and the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA), as well as the Directorate-General for Joint Research Centre (DG JRC), are leading EU work to facilitate the development of safe and secure maritime activities in the Arctic, notably through the Blue Growth strategy. Sectors of the blue economy include aquaculture, coastal tourism, marine biotechnology, ocean energy, and seabed extraction.
As the Arctic sea ice melts, the Northeast and Northwest passages become more accessible and maritime traffic in the Arctic may increase in the medium to long term. Furthermore, some fish stocks are now moving further north and fishing fleets are interested in following them; this raises interest in fishing regimes and the preservation of marine biodiversity etc. These maritime activities also require more attention to Arctic shipping safety.
Sustainable ocean governance
The EU aims to ensure that our oceans are safe, secure, clean and sustainably managed, as outlined in the Joint Communication on an International ocean governance agenda for the future of our oceans. The Joint Communication proposes work to be undertaken in three priority areas: improving the institutional framework; sustainable management to reduce human impact; and investing in knowledge and data for the oceans. The EU conducts various activities in line with this aim (non-exhaustive list):
Supporting the safe and sustainable blue economy contributes to 'conserving and sustainably using the oceans, seas and marine resources' (UN Sustainable Development Goal 14).
The Commission Directorate-General for International Cooperation and Development (DG DEVCO) leads EU work to help enhance education in the Arctic Overseas Countries and Territories (OCTs) (Greenland). The Directorate-General for Research & Innovation (DG RTD) also contributes to this work.
Technology for learning
Access to broadband internet can facilitate distance learning, on-line courses, file sharing, video uploads and other on-line educational support tools. EU satellite technologies and programmes are being used to support the educational needs of Arctic communities.
Arctic research and science education
EDU-ARCTIC is an innovative educational programme which aims to encourage students to pursue further education in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) and polar research. EDU-ARCTIC focuses on using Arctic research as a vehicle to strengthen science education curricula all across Europe. The EDU-ARCTIC project uses a mix of different tools to bring a fresh approach to teaching STEM subjects.
Greenland
Greenland is an autonomous territory within the Kingdom of Denmark, but withdrew from the EU in 1985. Greenland is now associated with the EU as one of the Overseas Countries and Territories (OCTs). DG DEVCO leads on all work relating to the OCTs. Relations between Greenland, the Kingdom of Denmark and the EU were reconfirmed by the signing of the 2015 Joint Declaration by the European Union, on the one hand, and the Government of Greenland and the Government of Denmark, on the other, on relations between the European Union and Greenland. Cooperation activities between Greenland and the EU fall under the Fisheries partnership agreement and/or the EU-Greenland Partnership.
Through the EU-Greenland Partnership, Greenland is eligible for EU funding, which is delivered through the Instrument for Greenland (IfG). Education, vocational training and the post-elementary school system are the main focus under the EU-Greenland Partnership.
Contributing to the development of education as described above works towards 'ensuring inclusive and quality education for all and promoting lifelong learning' (UN Sustainable Development Goal 4).
The Commission Directorate-General for Maritime Affairs and Fisheries (DG Mare) leads on the EU's work with Arctic indigenous peoples. Sustainable development in the Arctic is important to indigenous peoples, and should take into account their traditional livelihoods. In order to preserve and share traditional knowledge, dialogue with and between those living in the Arctic region is essential.
Indigenous Peoples Dialogue
The EU, led by DG Mare, organises the Arctic Indigenous Peoples Dialogue on a regular basis. This dialogue is a forum where Arctic indigenous peoples can exchange views and agree on areas for further cooperation with the EU, particularly in relation to sustainable development.
Tourism in the Arctic regions is developing rapidly, although in different forms across the Arctic region. While tourism brings important benefits to many Northern communities through economic growth, job creation, improved connections to lower latitudes (flights, telecommunications, social networks etc.) and increasing interest in local and indigenous goods, the potential risks to the fragile Arctic environment and to traditional ways of life cannot be ignored.
The Commission Directorate-General for Growth (DG Grow), Directorate-General for Environment (DG Env) and the Directorate-General for Regional and Urban Policy (DG Regio) lead EU work to support the development of sustainable Arctic tourism.
EU Tourism policy
A significant proportion of tourists to the Arctic are EU citizens. One priority of the EU Tourism Policy is to promote the development of sustainable, responsible, and high-quality tourism. Several Member States have created initiatives to promote sustainable tourism which incorporate the recommendations of the EU Tourism Policy.
Cruise ship tourism
With the thaw of sea ice, the cruise ship industry in the Arctic is growing. This brings significant economic benefits, but also risks, including the potential for grounding or sinking, oil spills, waste water discharge and water pollution.
In order to mitigate the potential for risk, the Arctic cruise ship industry is subject to EU standards for waste management, as well as related regulations under the International Maritime Organization (IMO).
Investment
In addition to funding available through the EU Tourism policy, the EU funds various projects to promote sustainable tourism in the Arctic (non-exhaustive list):
The Commission Directorate-General for Regional and Urban Policy (DG Regio) leads EU work to increase communications connectivity, and the Directorate-General for Growth (DG Grow) is leading EU work on space technology.
Some obstacles to sustainable development in the Arctic stem from its vast size, extreme climatic conditions, sparse population and relative inaccessibility. These challenges can be countered through EU space-based services which are able to provide cost-effective solutions to meet the needs of those living and working in the region.
Improved access to the internet and other means of communication in Arctic regions is an important factor that could increase economic productivity and facilitate access to wider markets for businesses operating in the Arctic. Increased connectivity could also bring strong social benefits, increasing the possibility for communication and creating/strengthening active links between indigenous communities, as well as facilitating remote education and public administration activities.
Earth observations
EU space programmes provide powerful observation coverage and operational services in the Arctic, which could increase efficiency in agriculture and fisheries, optimise transport, and improve crisis response.
Data sharing
As a member of the Group on Earth Observations (GEO), the EU will promote an integrated pan-Arctic observing system through the GEO Cold Region Initiative (GEOCRI), which aims to promote Earth observations data sharing and cooperation, enabling improved information services for stakeholders. This action has been funded by Horizon 2020, the EU Research and Innovation Framework Programme which is contributing to the ongoing development of pan-Arctic observing initiatives.
Investment
Through the Structural Funds programme 2014-2020, Sweden and Finland have both been allocated funding for regional projects, including investment in broadband. These investments build on national and/or regional growth and smart specialisation strategies.
The Commission Directorate-General for Research & Innovation (DG RTD), the Joint Research Centre (DG JRC), and the Directorate-General for Growth (DG Grow), along with the Directorate-General for Regional and Urban Policy (DG Regio) are leading EU work in supporting sustainable innovation and local businesses. The use of innovative technologies in the Arctic has the potential to bring broad social and economic benefits both within and beyond the Arctic region. The EU is supporting innovation in the Arctic through a variety of activities.
Funding programmes
The EU Research and Innovation Framework Programme Horizon 2020 supports actions that could speed up the translation of research outcomes into cold-climate technologies and services with commercial potential. InnovFin - EU Finance for innovators is one such Horizon 2020 instrument; a joint initiative with the European Investment Bank Group, to help Arctic-related research and innovation projects get access to the market.
The INTERACT (DG Regio) cooperation programmes, funded by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), provide free advice, services and products to support Interreg projects and facilitate exchanges between partners.
Collaboration between EU-funded programmes
Cross-programme collaboration is encouraged and mandated by the European Commission and the EU High Representative in the Joint Communication A new integrated EU policy for the Arctic. Ultimately, the collaboration should provide input for establishing research and investment priorities in the European Arctic.
Cross-programme collaboration is coordinated by the Northern Periphery and Arctic Programme. Participating programmes are Interreg Botnia-Atlantica, Interreg Nord, Kolarctic CBC, and Karelia CBC. The collaboration will consider including other programmes. With a view to enabling high complementarity with other policy initiatives and stakeholder organisations operating in the Arctic, these organisations will be consulted or involved where appropriate.
The programmes are working on:
You can find more information on the Northern Periphery and Arctic Programme website.
The EU is also funding research and innovation projects in the Arctic through the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF) programmes.
Supporting local businesses
The EU offers free support to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) through the Enterprise Europe Network which helps make the most of business opportunities in the EU and beyond. The Network will continue to ‘coach’ Arctic SMEs at their request. Furthermore, the EU invests in businesses operating in the Arctic through the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD).
The EU contributes European Structural and Investment ESI funds to kick-start growth, job creation and investment across Europe, notably in the least developed areas and sectors with growth potential.
European Investment Advisory Hub and Project Portal is a 'one-stop-shop' for investors or project promoters and public managing authorities to provide advice at EU and local levels on project identification, development and preparation.
Supporting innovation and local businesses in the Arctic in this way contributes to 'promoting inclusive and sustainable economic growth, employment and decent work for all' (UN Sustainable Development Goal 8).
The EU, led by the Commission Directorate-General for Maritime Affairs and Fisheries (DG Mare), has set up an Arctic Stakeholder Forum (ASF). This forum brings together EU institutions, European Arctic Member States, regional and local authorities, and indigenous peoples to identify key investment and research priorities for the coming years and enhance collaboration and coordination between different EU funding programmes.
From 2018, the ASF will be replaced by an Arctic Stakeholder Conference. . European Union External Action

The EU is committed to implementing the United Nations (UN) 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development to achieve sustainable development in its three dimensions – economic, social and environmental – in a balanced and integrated manner. Several EU activities taking place in and relating to the Arctic region should contribute to the achievement of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
In order to support socio-economic activities taking place in the Arctic regions, Arctic infrastructure and logistics play an important role as enabling factors. These sectors also have strong growth potential, as well as environmental impacts and social implications in their own right.
The Commission Directorate-General for Regional and Urban Policy (DG Regio) and Directorate-General for Mobility and Transport (DG Move) are leading EU work to increase infrastructure capacity and improve transport connectivity in the Arctic. Depending on the context, the EU can support activities in these sectors, thereby contributing to increasing productivity and improving trade between the Arctic and the EU. It remains important to pay due attention to increased environmental impacts as well as positive and/or potentially adverse implications for social cohesion and mobility.
Infrastructure
The EU Cohesion Policy 2014-2020 supports Arctic investments and capacity building.
The Investment Plan for Europe supports various infrastructure projects in the European Arctic, including Greenland.
Increasing infrastructure capacity and transport connectivity contributes to 'building resilient infrastructure, promoting sustainable industrialization and fostering innovation' (UN Sustainable Development Goal 9).
The EU’s environment policies promote the transformation towards an inclusive green economy that balances environmental considerations with growth, creates jobs and helps reduce poverty through sustainable management of natural capital. Resource efficiency, ecosystem resilience and human well-being are three crucial factors needed to find the balance between development and sustainability.
The Commission Directorate-General for Environment (DG Env) together with the European Environment Agency (EEA) leads EU work on environmental matters, including the promotion of the green economy.
Further information on EU work to safeguard the Arctic environment can be found on the Climate Change and the Arctic Environment subpage.
Using innovation
To protect the environment and make EU industry more competitive, we need technologies, processes and business models that use resources more efficiently. We call these solutions 'eco-innovation'. The EU supports green technology and green products through a range of funding schemes and policies (non-exhaustive list):
Resource efficiency
Europe 2020, the EU's growth strategy, aims to make the EU a smart, sustainable and inclusive economy. This includes encouraging the use of resources, such as water, minerals and timber, in a more sustainable way. One of the building blocks of this initiative is the Roadmap to a Resource-Efficient Europe.
Sustainable consumption and production
Sustainable consumption and production maximises business' potential to transform environmental challenges into economic opportunities and provide a better deal for consumers. A range of EU and national policies foster resource efficient and eco-friendly products and raise consumer awareness. Notably, the Sustainable Consumption and Production Action Plan aims to improve the environmental performance of products and increase the demand for more sustainable goods and production technologies.
Preventing and managing waste
In order to promote the sustainable use of resources in the Arctic, the EU will share experiences and best practices on the circular economy with Arctic states.
Managing water resources
Access to good quality water and having a healthy marine environment are essential for people, nature and economic activities. The EU's Water Framework Directive aims to ensure good quality water around the EU by managing river basin systems in a coordinated way at regional and national levels.
Encouraging a move towards the green economy in the ways described above contributes to 'ensuring sustainable consumption and production patterns' (UN Sustainable Development Goal 12).
The Commission Directorate-General for Maritime Affairs and Fisheries (DG Mare), Directorate-General for Mobility and Transport (DG Move) and the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA), as well as the Directorate-General for Joint Research Centre (DG JRC), are leading EU work to facilitate the development of safe and secure maritime activities in the Arctic, notably through the Blue Growth strategy. Sectors of the blue economy include aquaculture, coastal tourism, marine biotechnology, ocean energy, and seabed extraction.
As the Arctic sea ice melts, the Northeast and Northwest passages become more accessible and maritime traffic in the Arctic may increase in the medium to long term. Furthermore, some fish stocks are now moving further north and fishing fleets are interested in following them; this raises interest in fishing regimes and the preservation of marine biodiversity etc. These maritime activities also require more attention to Arctic shipping safety.
Sustainable ocean governance
The EU aims to ensure that our oceans are safe, secure, clean and sustainably managed, as outlined in the Joint Communication on an International ocean governance agenda for the future of our oceans. The Joint Communication proposes work to be undertaken in three priority areas: improving the institutional framework; sustainable management to reduce human impact; and investing in knowledge and data for the oceans. The EU conducts various activities in line with this aim (non-exhaustive list):
Supporting the safe and sustainable blue economy contributes to 'conserving and sustainably using the oceans, seas and marine resources' (UN Sustainable Development Goal 14).
The Commission Directorate-General for International Cooperation and Development (DG DEVCO) leads EU work to help enhance education in the Arctic Overseas Countries and Territories (OCTs) (Greenland). The Directorate-General for Research & Innovation (DG RTD) also contributes to this work.
Technology for learning
Access to broadband internet can facilitate distance learning, on-line courses, file sharing, video uploads and other on-line educational support tools. EU satellite technologies and programmes are being used to support the educational needs of Arctic communities.
Arctic research and science education
EDU-ARCTIC is an innovative educational programme which aims to encourage students to pursue further education in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) and polar research. EDU-ARCTIC focuses on using Arctic research as a vehicle to strengthen science education curricula all across Europe. The EDU-ARCTIC project uses a mix of different tools to bring a fresh approach to teaching STEM subjects.
Greenland
Greenland is an autonomous territory within the Kingdom of Denmark, but withdrew from the EU in 1985. Greenland is now associated with the EU as one of the Overseas Countries and Territories (OCTs). DG DEVCO leads on all work relating to the OCTs. Relations between Greenland, the Kingdom of Denmark and the EU were reconfirmed by the signing of the 2015 Joint Declaration by the European Union, on the one hand, and the Government of Greenland and the Government of Denmark, on the other, on relations between the European Union and Greenland. Cooperation activities between Greenland and the EU fall under the Fisheries partnership agreement and/or the EU-Greenland Partnership.
Through the EU-Greenland Partnership, Greenland is eligible for EU funding, which is delivered through the Instrument for Greenland (IfG). Education, vocational training and the post-elementary school system are the main focus under the EU-Greenland Partnership.
Contributing to the development of education as described above works towards 'ensuring inclusive and quality education for all and promoting lifelong learning' (UN Sustainable Development Goal 4).
The Commission Directorate-General for Maritime Affairs and Fisheries (DG Mare) leads on the EU's work with Arctic indigenous peoples. Sustainable development in the Arctic is important to indigenous peoples, and should take into account their traditional livelihoods. In order to preserve and share traditional knowledge, dialogue with and between those living in the Arctic region is essential.
Indigenous Peoples Dialogue
The EU, led by DG Mare, organises the Arctic Indigenous Peoples Dialogue on a regular basis. This dialogue is a forum where Arctic indigenous peoples can exchange views and agree on areas for further cooperation with the EU, particularly in relation to sustainable development.
Tourism in the Arctic regions is developing rapidly, although in different forms across the Arctic region. While tourism brings important benefits to many Northern communities through economic growth, job creation, improved connections to lower latitudes (flights, telecommunications, social networks etc.) and increasing interest in local and indigenous goods, the potential risks to the fragile Arctic environment and to traditional ways of life cannot be ignored.
The Commission Directorate-General for Growth (DG Grow), Directorate-General for Environment (DG Env) and the Directorate-General for Regional and Urban Policy (DG Regio) lead EU work to support the development of sustainable Arctic tourism.
EU Tourism policy
A significant proportion of tourists to the Arctic are EU citizens. One priority of the EU Tourism Policy is to promote the development of sustainable, responsible, and high-quality tourism. Several Member States have created initiatives to promote sustainable tourism which incorporate the recommendations of the EU Tourism Policy.
Cruise ship tourism
With the thaw of sea ice, the cruise ship industry in the Arctic is growing. This brings significant economic benefits, but also risks, including the potential for grounding or sinking, oil spills, waste water discharge and water pollution.
In order to mitigate the potential for risk, the Arctic cruise ship industry is subject to EU standards for waste management, as well as related regulations under the International Maritime Organization (IMO).
Investment
In addition to funding available through the EU Tourism policy, the EU funds various projects to promote sustainable tourism in the Arctic (non-exhaustive list):
The Commission Directorate-General for Regional and Urban Policy (DG Regio) leads EU work to increase communications connectivity, and the Directorate-General for Growth (DG Grow) is leading EU work on space technology.
Some obstacles to sustainable development in the Arctic stem from its vast size, extreme climatic conditions, sparse population and relative inaccessibility. These challenges can be countered through EU space-based services which are able to provide cost-effective solutions to meet the needs of those living and working in the region.
Improved access to the internet and other means of communication in Arctic regions is an important factor that could increase economic productivity and facilitate access to wider markets for businesses operating in the Arctic. Increased connectivity could also bring strong social benefits, increasing the possibility for communication and creating/strengthening active links between indigenous communities, as well as facilitating remote education and public administration activities.
Earth observations
EU space programmes provide powerful observation coverage and operational services in the Arctic, which could increase efficiency in agriculture and fisheries, optimise transport, and improve crisis response.
Data sharing
As a member of the Group on Earth Observations (GEO), the EU will promote an integrated pan-Arctic observing system through the GEO Cold Region Initiative (GEOCRI), which aims to promote Earth observations data sharing and cooperation, enabling improved information services for stakeholders. This action has been funded by Horizon 2020, the EU Research and Innovation Framework Programme which is contributing to the ongoing development of pan-Arctic observing initiatives.
Investment
Through the Structural Funds programme 2014-2020, Sweden and Finland have both been allocated funding for regional projects, including investment in broadband. These investments build on national and/or regional growth and smart specialisation strategies.
The Commission Directorate-General for Research & Innovation (DG RTD), the Joint Research Centre (DG JRC), and the Directorate-General for Growth (DG Grow), along with the Directorate-General for Regional and Urban Policy (DG Regio) are leading EU work in supporting sustainable innovation and local businesses. The use of innovative technologies in the Arctic has the potential to bring broad social and economic benefits both within and beyond the Arctic region. The EU is supporting innovation in the Arctic through a variety of activities.
Funding programmes
The EU Research and Innovation Framework Programme Horizon 2020 supports actions that could speed up the translation of research outcomes into cold-climate technologies and services with commercial potential. InnovFin - EU Finance for innovators is one such Horizon 2020 instrument; a joint initiative with the European Investment Bank Group, to help Arctic-related research and innovation projects get access to the market.
The INTERACT (DG Regio) cooperation programmes, funded by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), provide free advice, services and products to support Interreg projects and facilitate exchanges between partners.
Collaboration between EU-funded programmes
Cross-programme collaboration is encouraged and mandated by the European Commission and the EU High Representative in the Joint Communication A new integrated EU policy for the Arctic. Ultimately, the collaboration should provide input for establishing research and investment priorities in the European Arctic.
Cross-programme collaboration is coordinated by the Northern Periphery and Arctic Programme. Participating programmes are Interreg Botnia-Atlantica, Interreg Nord, Kolarctic CBC, and Karelia CBC. The collaboration will consider including other programmes. With a view to enabling high complementarity with other policy initiatives and stakeholder organisations operating in the Arctic, these organisations will be consulted or involved where appropriate.
The programmes are working on:
You can find more information on the Northern Periphery and Arctic Programme website.
The EU is also funding research and innovation projects in the Arctic through the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF) programmes.
Supporting local businesses
The EU offers free support to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) through the Enterprise Europe Network which helps make the most of business opportunities in the EU and beyond. The Network will continue to ‘coach’ Arctic SMEs at their request. Furthermore, the EU invests in businesses operating in the Arctic through the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD).
The EU contributes European Structural and Investment ESI funds to kick-start growth, job creation and investment across Europe, notably in the least developed areas and sectors with growth potential.
European Investment Advisory Hub and Project Portal is a 'one-stop-shop' for investors or project promoters and public managing authorities to provide advice at EU and local levels on project identification, development and preparation.
Supporting innovation and local businesses in the Arctic in this way contributes to 'promoting inclusive and sustainable economic growth, employment and decent work for all' (UN Sustainable Development Goal 8).
The EU, led by the Commission Directorate-General for Maritime Affairs and Fisheries (DG Mare), has set up an Arctic Stakeholder Forum (ASF). This forum brings together EU institutions, European Arctic Member States, regional and local authorities, and indigenous peoples to identify key investment and research priorities for the coming years and enhance collaboration and coordination between different EU funding programmes.
From 2018, the ASF will be replaced by an Arctic Stakeholder Conference. . ",True,True,True,True,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True

It is through language that we communicate with the world, define our identity, express our history and culture, learn, defend our human rights and participate in all aspects of society, to name but a few. Through language, people preserve their community’s history, customs and traditions, memory, unique modes of thinking, meaning and expression. They also use it to construct their future.
Language is pivotal in the areas of human rights protection, good governance, peace building, reconciliation, and sustainable development.
1. Increasing understanding, reconciliation and international cooperation.
2. Creation of favourable conditions for knowledge-sharing and dissemination of good practices with regards to indigenous languages.
3. Integration of indigenous languages into standard setting.
4. Empowerment through capacity building.
5. Growth and development through elaboration of new knowledge.

of all stakeholders to take measures that will support, access and promote indigenous languages in accordance with the legitimate rights of the people who speak them
We hope actions taken during IYIL2019 will generate as much interest and positive change as possible for indigenous languages and those who speak them.
It is with this in mind that we invite you to get involved in making the year a success. The survival and robustness of indigenous languages plays a vital role in the sustainable development of the communities that speak them.
As such, events taking place during IYIL2019 should take into account the three main themes of the year which encompass both the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the 17 Sustainable Development Goals.

Environmental impacts and indicators for the state of the nature on Svalbard
Published:
Svalbard covers 61 022 km 2 , about 98 per cent of which is wilderness. The annual average temperature in 2012 was -3.2°C (Svalbard Airport), compared to -7.6°C in 1967 – an indication that the temperature has gradually risen. The glaciers are dwindling. Local emissions of CO 2 are increasing. Long-range transboundary air pollution has declined.
Svalbard consists of all islands and skerries between 74° and 81° north latitude and 10° and 35° east longitude, and the largest is Spitsbergen. Svalbard is surrounded by the Barents Sea, the Greenland Sea and the Arctic Ocean. The archipelago contains the largest continuous wilderness in Norway.
The purpose of the Svalbard Environmental Protection Act is to safeguard the virtually untouched areas in Svalbard. Within the limits of this framework, environmentally sound settlement, research and commercial activity is provided for. Approximately 40 000 km 2 is protected, and around 99.8 per cent is national parks and nature reserves.
On the basis of environmental surveillance programs there are several statistics available on various formats and web portals. The motivation for all of them is to show whether the management is in compliance with the protection act and that the unique wilderness is kept unspoiled. Statistics Norway plays a central role in establishing official statistics for Svalbard and environmental statistics is part of this. It is challenging to delimit the statistics to a set of environmental parameters that in the best way possible reflects the development of the Svalbard nature. In addition, the parameters should have a proper time series with the prospects of continuity.
Long-range environmental impact
Persistent organic pollutants
Seemingly, Svalbard is far to the north and a long distance from where major pollution activities take place. Nonetheless, air- and sea-currents carry pollutants to the Svalbard archipelago and the surrounding oceans. Several persistent organic pollutants are easily absorbed in adipose tissue in organisms and these compounds accumulate in the food chain. This is very common for the long marine food chains of the Arctic. For some species the levels of persistent organic pollutants in adipose tissue have become so high that immune systems and hormone systems are damaged. This can lead to shortened lifespan and reduced fertility. On Svalbard, during the last 10 – 15 years, monitoring shows a decrease in concentrations for several airborne pollutants, but not for all.
Local environmental impacts
Emissions to air
The settlements are the main local sources of pollution. The pollution comprises emissions to air, water and ground, and the activities that cause most of the pollution are coal fired power stations, diesel generators and transportation (airplane, helicopter, boat, cars and snow mobile). A survey carried out in 2009 for the Norwegian Environment Agency, shows that for the years 2000 – 2007, the CO 2 -emissions are increasing. Boat traffic is the main contributor to the growing CO 2 -emissions.
Discharges to water
Discharges to water bodies (freshwater and sea) on Svalbard are mainly from the untreated sewerage system and from an unknown amount of diffuse pollution. The estimated annual discharge of phosphorus from Longyearbyen (population 2 100) is 1.2 tonnes. The discharge of nitrogen is estimated to 9 tonnes per year.
Waste
The settlements produce waste. The statistics for 2011 on waste from households in Longyearbyen show that on average each inhabitant discards 216 kg per year. That is less than half of what inhabitants on the mainland dispose of per year. In Longyearbyen all dwellings have quite recently installed waste disposers for food waste that are connected to the sewerage system. This contributes to the quite low figures on household waste but increases the load of organic material that is discharged to the fjord.
During the last couple of years somewhere between 100 and 300 tonnes of hazardous waste have been collected annually. In 2012 160 tonnes were collected and sent to the mainland for treatment.
Transportation
The statistics on local emissions reveals considerable contributions from traffic; ships, aircrafts and other types of vehicles. Since 2000, there have been on average 6 400 aircraft movements on Svalbard Airport every year. Around 1 300 movements are incoming or outbound flights. The remaining 4 100 are flights to and from destinations on the archipelago.
Most of the ships are involved in tourism. Regular cruise ships are dominating, but there are also smaller boats taking tourists on day trips to various destinations. Every year around 40 000 guests arrive in Longyearbyen. A considerable part of these guests also go on boat trips. A major part of the boat trip experience is to go ashore on sites of historical significance or for nature experiences. In 2012 circa 121 000 persons went ashore on 239 different sites. Many persons went ashore on several sites on their trips.
Another highly appreciated activity on Svalbard, for both residents and tourists, is snowmobile driving. There are slightly above 2 000 registered snowmobiles on Svalbard. The annual number of trips is partly determined by the weather and snow conditions, but also by the number of tourists wanting to go on a trip. In 2012 the snow conditions were very difficult and the number of trips accordingly low.
There is a falling trend in the driving of snowmobiles in areas where notification rules apply. The number of residents that apply for permits for driving in national parks has dropped and so has the number of completed trips. The same trend can be seen for tourists driving in areas where notification rules apply.
Guided trips on snowmobiles are still popular, and depending on the snow conditions, the number of days in the field for guided trips varies between 2 500 and 4 500 per year.
Hunting
Since 1997 there has been an annual average kill of 1 170 Svalbard ptarmigan, 180 reindeer, 122 arctic fox and 63 seals. Walrus and polar bear are protected, so there is no hunting season on these two species. Still, since 1990 there has been shot 2.6 polar bears per year, predominantly of safety reasons.
State of nature
Climate
An important precondition for the species that inhabit Svalbard to remain is a stable climate. Since the middle of the 1960-ies, the annual average temperature at Svalbard Airport has increased by 4.4 °C. The maximum temperature in the West-Spitsbergen current shows a similar upward trend.
Glaciers
Glaciers are influenced by climate. The gap between winter accumulation and melting in the summer expresses the change in mass balance for a glacier. Melting of glaciers on a large scale can lead to a rise in sea level. Glaciers also influence on microclimate and the conditions for local plants an wildlife.
The monitoring of the glaciers Austre Brøggerbreen, Midtre Lovénbreen, Kronebreen and Holtedalsfonna and also Kongsvegen has revealed a loss of ice mass. For Kongsvegen, since it is located higher than the other glaciers and has a larger accumulation area, the mass balance has been positive for several years throughout the monitoring period. However, the net balance has gradually shifted from positive to negative and Kongsvegen now seems to be in a long-term decline.
Sea ice
One of the most important preconditions for the entire arctic ecosystem, and the areas around Svalbard, is the sea ice. Enormous amounts of phytoplankton are produced along the ice shelf and give the basis for a complex food chain. The sea ice is also habitat for seal and polar bear. In April the sea ice is normally at its largest extent. Normally there are annual variations, but since the beginning of monitoring the sea ice there has been a falling trend for the ice extent. This can be seen for both the Barents Sea and the Fram Strait.
Indicator species
On both land and sea Svalbard boasts a rich plant- and wildlife. A selection of indicator species can give valuable information on status for the food chains. The huge variations in arctic fox breeding scientist assume are related to food supply. Available reindeer carcases in the winter and the vicinity of the den to seabird colonies are decisive for the number of arctic fox dens with cubs. The number of arctic foxes is quite stable even though there are variations in breeding activity. In addition, there seems to be a correlation, to some extent, between arctic fox breeding and the density of Svalbard ptarmigan.
In the breeding season Guillemot feed on fish species like capelin and herring. This makes Guillemot a good indicator on variations in fish populations. The Guillemot population in the Barents Sea and northern parts of the Norwegian Sea has dropped dramatically, and this bird is now on the Norwegian “red list” of threatened species. During the winter of 1986 – 1987 the Guillemot population on the island Bjørnøya collapsed due to lack of capelin to feed on. Since then the population has been increasing and Bjørnøya now has the largest breeding population in the Barents Sea.
In contrast to the Guillemot, Kittiwake feeds on organisms on or close to the sea surface. The Kittiwake feeds on shoals of young capelin, cod and crustaceans, and represents this part of the marine ecosystem. The Kittiwake population is now stable after a period of recession. . Topic

Amended by the Act of 20 April 2012 No. 20 (in force from 1 July 2012 in accordance with the Royal Decree of 20 April 2012 No. 332).
Chapter IX. Enforcement and sanctions
Section 93 (restoration)
Any person that has had an impact on the environment in Svalbard by contravening provisions laid down in or under this Act shall take the remedial action necessary to prevent further environmental impact and, if possible, to restore the original state of the environment by appropriate action such as collection, clearing up, removal, the release of organisms, or levelling the ground. Measures that in themselves may have a significant impact on the environment may only be carried out with the consent of or by order of the Governor.
The duty to take remedial action and to restore the environment does not apply in so far as it would be especially unreasonable in view of the cost and effect of the measures, the environmental impact of the contravention and the offender’s fault and financial situation.
Within the framework of this section, the Governor may issue orders regarding the remedial and restoration measures that are to be carried out, including orders regarding the killing of living organisms to which the contravention applies or the return of living organisms or items of the cultural heritage to their original location.
Section 94 (ownership rights to items of flora and fauna handled in contravention of this Act, etc.)
Items of flora and fauna that are collected, trapped or killed in contravention of this Act, or killed in accordance with section 33, first paragraph, and section 34, are to be dealt with by the Governor. The same applies to wildlife found dead, parts of wildlife found dead, animals killed in the interests of animal welfare and animals killed in connection with research. The arrangements set out in the first and second sentences may be enforced through the imposition of fines or court judgments under the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Act relating to confiscation.
The Governor will decide what is to be done with such items of flora and fauna. The value of items of flora and fauna such as are mentioned in the first paragraph accrues to the Svalbard Environmental Protection Fund. The Governor may require the payment of compensation equivalent to their value if the Governor is not given access to the flora and fauna in accordance with this paragraph.
Amended by the Act of 20 April 2012 No. 20 (in force from 1 July 2012 in accordance with the Royal Decree of 20 April 2012 No. 332).
Section 95 (compensation)
Any person that causes environmental damage by contravening provisions laid down in or under this Act is liable to pay compensation regardless of any fault on his part for economic loss resulting from the environmental damage. Persons that have indirectly contributed to the environmental damage (by delivering goods or services, carrying out inspection or control measures or in any other way) are nevertheless only liable to the extent that intent or negligence can be shown.
Liability in accordance with the first paragraph also applies to
- financial losses incurred because the environmental damage prevents or impedes the exercise of the public right of access and passage in connection with commercial activities;
- the costs of or losses relating to reasonable measures to reduce or mitigate environmental damage or to restore the state of the environment;
- the costs borne by any person for clearing up waste left in contravention of section 71.
The Governor may order any person that by contravening provisions laid down in or under this Act has caused appreciable environmental damage to pay environmental compensation to the Svalbard Environmental Protection Fund. The amount of the environmental compensation to be paid is set on the basis of the value of what has been damaged, the extent and duration of the environmental damage, the fault of the offender, other sanctions imposed on the offender and the general circumstances.
A decision by the Governor regarding environmental compensation in accordance with the third paragraph is enforceable by execution proceedings. Liability to pay compensation may also be the subject of criminal proceedings. If the compensation claim is brought before a court in a criminal case, civil action or complaint against execution proceedings, the court may conduct a full trial of the compensation claim. The decision may not be appealed under the provisions of the Public Administration Act. Notification of the decision shall provide information about the provisions of this paragraph.
This section applies in so far as it is not otherwise provided by international agreements to which Norway is a party and that apply to Svalbard.
Section 96 (coercive fine)
In order to ensure the implementation of the provisions of this Act or decisions taken under this Act, the Governor may impose a coercive fine payable to the Svalbard Environmental Protection Fund.
A coercive fine may be imposed when contravention of a provision is discovered. The fine becomes effective if the person responsible fails to meet the deadline for remedying the matter set by the Governor. A coercive fine may be imposed in advance if there are special reasons for doing so, and in such cases becomes effective from the date when any contravention starts. It may be decided that the coercive fine shall continue to be effective for as long as the unlawful situation persists, or that it is payable each time contravention takes place. However, a coercive fine does not continue to be payable if compliance with the obligation is impossible owing to circumstances for which the person responsible is not to blame.
If the contravention has occurred on behalf of a company or other association, a foundation or a public body, the coercive fine shall normally be imposed on the entity concerned. If a coercive fine is imposed on a group of companies, accrued amounts thereof may also be recovered from the parent company. The Ministry may waive accrued amounts of a coercive fine.
§ 96a.(contravention charge)
The Governor may order any person that wilfully or negligently contravenes the provisions of sections 16, second paragraph, 26 to 28, 30a, 30 to 33, 35, 42, 46, 65 to 68, 70, 71, 73, second paragraph, 79 to 83, 86 and 94 of this Act to pay a contravention charge to the Svalbard Environmental Protection Fund.
The ministry may in regulations lay down further provisions on which contraventions such as are mentioned in the first paragraph may result in a contravention charge. Such regulations shall also lay down further provisions on determining contravention charges, including their size.
A final decision to impose a contravention charge is enforceable by execution proceedings. The courts may decide on the size of the contravention charge.
A contravention charge in accordance with the first to third paragraphs may be imposed on an enterprise if the contravention was committed by someone acting on behalf of the enterprise. This applies even if no contravention charge can be imposed on an individual person.
Added by the Act of 20 April 2012 No. 20 (in force from 1 July 2012 in accordance with the Royal Decree of 20 April 2012 No. 332.
Section 97 (direct implementation)
In the event of failure to comply with any duties following from this Act or decisions made under the Act, the Governor may take the measures necessary to ensure compliance with the said duties. Before this is done, the Governor shall give notice requiring the person responsible to take such measures to make amends within a short time limit. Such notification may be dispensed with in cases where the measures are urgently needed in the interests of the environment or where the identity of the person responsible has not been established.
When implementing measures under the first paragraph, the Governor may make use of and if necessary cause damage to the property of the person responsible. The Governor may if necessary decide that the use of or damage to another person’s property is permissible in return for remuneration. The state will act as guarantor for such remuneration.
Expenses incurred by the Governor in implementing measures may be claimed from the person responsible. The demand is enforceable by execution proceedings.
Section 98 (Svalbard Environmental Protection Fund)
The Svalbard Environmental Protection Fund is comprised of proceeds collected under sections 32, second paragraph, 78, 94, 95, third paragraph, 96 and 96a.
The Fund’s proceeds may only be used for measures in Svalbard for the purpose of protecting the environment. They may be used for
- investigations and measures to survey and monitor the state of the environment, the causes of environmental pressure and the environmental impact of activities;
- restoration of the environment;
- grants for the management, maintenance and investigations of the cultural heritage in so far as the person responsible cannot be expected to cover the expenses of these measures;
- information and training measures and measures to improve access.
The Ministry will appoint the members of the board of the Fund and may prescribe rules relating to the way in which the Fund shall be managed. Decisions regarding allocations from the Fund are not regarded as individual decisions under the Public Administration Act.
Amended by the Act of 20 April 2012 No. 20 (in force from 1 July 2012 in accordance with the Royal Decree of 20 April 2012 No. 332).
Section 99 (penalties)
Any person that wilfully or negligently contravenes provisions laid down in or under this Act is liable to fines or to a term of imprisonment not exceeding one year. If a risk of substantial environmental damage has occurred or been caused or if there are especially aggravating circumstances, a term of imprisonment not exceeding three years may be imposed.

Major Seed deposit at the Svalbard Global Seed Vault, Longyearbyen
News story | Date: 25/02/2020 | Ministry of Agriculture and Food, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Office of the Prime Minister
Today, 36 genebanks from all continents deposited seeds at the Svalbard Global Seed Vault, at a deposit event hosted by Norwegian Prime Minister and co-chair ofthe UN group of SDG Advocates, Erna Solberg. President of Ghana and co-chair Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo and other members of the Group of Advocate salso participated at the event.
The Svalbard Global Seed Vault is the world’s largest back-up collection of seed samples from the world’s genebanks. The seeds that were deposited today come from 36 international and regional genebanks, as well as national institutions and civil society organisations, bringing the total number of seed samples stored in the Svalbard Global Seed Vault to more than one million, and the total number of depositors to 85.
Among them were first-time depositors Cherokee Nation (USA), the University of Haifa (Israel), Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique (Morocco), the Julius Kühn Institute (Germany), the Lebanese Agricultural Research Institute, the Baekdudaegan National Arboretum (South Korea), Suceava Genebank ‘Mihai Cristea’ (Romania), and Kew Gardens (UK).
– This deposit event is especially timely, given that 2020 is the deadline for meeting target 2.5 of SDG 2 on zero hunger, which calls on the international community to safeguard the genetic diversity of crops and livestock, said Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg.
The seeds of several hundred different plant species were deposited today and included common staple crops and a large variety of vegetables, herbs and their less-used wild relatives.
Today’s deposit was the largest since the Seed Vault’s opening in 2008, in terms of the number of institutions to send seeds at one time. It was also the first major deposit since the completion of a technical upgrade in 2019. The improvements that have been made to the Seed Vault include the construction of a new waterproof access tunnel, together with other security measures in preparation for what is expected to be a warmer, wetter future.
– Norway greatly values the trust shown to us by all the genebanks that have chosen to use the Svalbard Global Seed Vault as part of their strategy for securing important seed collections. We are strongly committed to managing the Seed Vault in accordance with the highest agreed international standards, said Norwegian Minister of Agriculture and Food Olaug Bollestad.
– Every single seed in the Svalbard Global Seed Vault holds potential solutions for sustainable agriculture. Solutions that are vital for feeding a growing population and achieving a green transition. As the operational manager of the Svalbard Global Seed Vault, we are proud to be part of this initiative and to be contributing to reaching SDG target 2.5, said Lise Lykke Steffensen, Executive Director at NordGen, the Nordic countries’ genebank and knowledge centre for genetic resources.
– As the pace of climate change and biodiversity loss increases, there is new urgency surrounding efforts to save food crops at risk of extinction,said Stefan Schmitz, Crop Trust Executive Director. – The large scope of today’s seed deposit reflects worldwide concern about the impacts of climate change and biodiversity loss on food production, but more importantly it demonstrates a growing global commitment – from the institutions and countries that have made deposits today and indeed the world – to the conservation and use of the crop diversity that is crucial for farmers in their efforts to adapt to changing growing conditions, Mr Schmitz said. .  .

Average high temperatures in July top out at 8°C; for three and a half months in the winter, the sun does not rise at all. Polar bears roam freely, meaning that anyone leaving the settlement of just over 2,000 people must carry a rifle. The mountainsides are bare but for a couple of shacks marking the entrance to the coal mines that brought the town into existence. Medical services are limited, and specialist care must be sought on the Norwegian mainland. Indeed, few if any people are born, or die, on the island of Svalbard, but instead move from the mainland for a few years.
Still, lower down in the valley, where a few scrappy blades of grass manage to grow, the colourful houses of today’s Longyearbyen residents, engaged mostly in tourism, line the mountains’ lower slopes. Despite their cheery appearance, they are increasingly threatened by climate change.
The biggest danger comes from the increased risk of landslides and avalanches, linked to climate change. One avalanche in December 2015 killed two and destroyed 11 houses; another, in February 2017, destroyed two buildings containing a total of six housing units. Svalbard’s local government reckons around 250 homes will eventually have to be torn down due to their location in risky areas.
Through Statsbygg, a state property-management company, Norway is ploughing Nkr220m ($27m) into 60 new houses to replace those already destroyed, and some of those still standing but most at risk. The first of these, shipped in modules from the mainland, were installed in September.
Climate change has made construction considerably trickier. Most of the town’s edifices are built on wood piles frozen into the permafrost; now that it is melting ever deeper, these are at risk of rotting, and so becoming unstable. Statsbygg’s new housing will consequently be put atop steel pilings driven deep through the permafrost to the underlying bedrock 10-15m beneath—the first residential buildings to be so constructed. The foundations will even come with sensors to monitor temperature and conditions. It is essential, says Hege Njaa Aschim of Statsbygg, to “be aware of everything [since] we cannot trust the permafrost anymore.”
Other places in Svalbard are affected, too. The Svalbard Seed Vault was built in 2008 into the permafrost just outside Longyearbyen to store seeds of a huge variety of crops in case of catastrophe. The vault itself, deep inside the mountain, is still fine, but the access tunnel to it from the surface failed to refreeze in the permafrost as expected, leading it to be flooded with rain and meltwater in 2016. Now, Statsbygg is spending Nkr100m to replace it with a waterproof concrete one, and installing equipment around the tunnel to freeze the surrounding soil.
So far, these problems have not stopped adventurers from arriving. There is a unique appeal to life in the remote archipelago—for outdoor enthusiasts, say, who can hop on a snowmobile to explore majestic glaciers. Locals swear by the camaraderie born of the harsh environment. (Even Longyearbyen’s fanciest hotels ask you to leave your shoes at the door, as if at home.) “Most people plan to come for a season, but end up staying for years,” says one local. Amid the melting glaciers and the destabilising mountain slopes, it remains to be seen if they can still do so in the future.

Statsbygg’s new housing will consequently be put atop steel pilings driven deep through the permafrost to the underlying bedrock 10-15m beneath—the first residential buildings to be so constructed. The foundations will even come with sensors to monitor temperature and conditions. It is essential, says Hege Njaa Aschim of Statsbygg, to “be aware of everything [since] we cannot trust the permafrost anymore.”
Other places in Svalbard are affected, too. The Svalbard Seed Vault was built in 2008 into the permafrost just outside Longyearbyen to store seeds of a huge variety of crops in case of catastrophe. The vault itself, deep inside the mountain, is still fine, but the access tunnel to it from the surface failed to refreeze in the permafrost as expected, leading it to be flooded with rain and meltwater in 2016. Now, Statsbygg is spending Nkr100m to replace it with a waterproof concrete one, and installing equipment around the tunnel to freeze the surrounding soil.
So far, these problems have not stopped adventurers from arriving. There is a unique appeal to life in the remote archipelago—for outdoor enthusiasts, say, who can hop on a snowmobile to explore majestic glaciers. Locals swear by the camaraderie born of the harsh environment. (Even Longyearbyen’s fanciest hotels ask you to leave your shoes at the door, as if at home.) “Most people plan to come for a season, but end up staying for years,” says one local. Amid the melting glaciers and the destabilising mountain slopes, it remains to be seen if they can still do so in the future.

Svalbard is exposed to the long-range transport of pollutants via air and ocean currents. There are also many local sources of pollution from the settlements, mining, research and tourism. The environment and many of the animal species in Svalbard contain, in part, very high levels of pollutants.
Industry, power production, tourism and other activities are strictly regulated by laws, regulations and individual permits. The regulations are designed to prevent and possibly minimise potential emissions and pollutants.
The Governor of Svalbard works actively to clear up old pollutants and remnants from mining and other activities. The Governor of Svalbard has an operational responsibility to deal with acute pollution. Waste management in the various settlements is regulated separately.
Several initiatives are carried out each year to clear marine litter from the Svalbard coast, with contributions from both residents and tourists who travel around the archipelago.
If you plan on putting out fuel for a snow scooter or boat trip, you must have permission from The Governor. Depots outside the planning areas that you do not have permission for or that violate set conditions can be seized by The Governor. . Environmental protection
Norway’s overarching goal for environmental protection in Svalbard is to preserve the archipelago’s distinctive wilderness and nature. In order to achieve the overarching goal, more detailed goals have been set for environmental protection in Svalbard.
- On the basis of its internationally important natural and cultural heritage, Svalbard shall be one of the world’s best-managed wilderness areas.
- Within the framework set by the Svalbard Treat and sovereignty considerations, environmental considerations shall be prioritised in conflicts between environmental protection and other interests.
- The scale of wilderness areas shall be maintained.
- Flora, fauna and cultural monuments that warrant protection shall remain virtually untouched and the natural ecological processes and biological diversity shall be allowed to develop virtually unaffected by activity in Svalbard.
- There shall be large and essentially untouched natural areas in Svalbard that meet the need for reference areas for climate and environmental research.
- The possibility of experiencing Svalbard’s natural environment without being disturbed by motorised traffic and noise shall be ensured, including in areas that are easily accessible from the settlements. . ",False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False

A public consultation on the opening up of nine new Norwegian oilfields closed on Wednesday. The areas in question are much further north in the Arctic than the concessions the US president, Donald Trump, announced for Alaska this month.
Experts say the area is regarded as risky both environmentally and in terms of profitability. They also say the decision risks antagonising other nations which are party to the 100-year-old Svalbard treaty, which regulates activity in the area concerned.
Ilan Kelman, a professor of risk, resilience and global health at UCL and Agder University in Norway, says there is no such thing as safe oil excavation in Arctic conditions. “Irrespective of changes in the environment, the Arctic is a very harsh place. A lot can go wrong, and when something goes wrong … it can cause extensive damage for a long time,” he said.
Helge Ryggvik, an oil historian at the University of Oslo, says Norway’s move is a result of the oil industry struggling, a crisis which has worsened during the coronavirus pandemic. “When prime minister Erna Solberg’s government announced the lease auction would go ahead, it was the culmination of a decades-long process that has seen Norway slowly edging ever further north,” he said.
Norway set the expected southern limit of ocean ice, also know as the “ice edge”, south of Svalbard in June. Oil exploration north of the edge is not permitted.
“In the recent ice-edge compromise, which redrew the zone, Norway is approaching the absolute limit of where oil exploration would be accepted by other nations,” said Ryggvik.
WWF, Friends of the Earth Norway, Greenpeace and Nature & Youth sent the Norwegian government an open letter on Monday, pointing out that in in the previous eight concession rounds between 2002 and 2019, the government had granted licences in areas where the environment ministry, Norwegian Polar institute and the Institute of Marine Research advised against exploration.
“Given that we don’t yet have the technology to clean up spills in an Arctic environment, it really doesn’t make any sense to continue with offshore extraction there,” said Kelman.
Erlend Jordal, a political adviser in Norway’s ministry of oil and energy,, said: “A broad parliamentary majority opened most of the Barents Sea to petroleum exploration more than 30 years ago. The exception is the south-east Barents Sea, which was opened by broad parliamentary consensus in 2013 following an agreement with Russia on the maritime lines drawn in that sea. In Norway we have a long experience with sound and secure petroleum activity in the Barents Sea.
“We have the strictest health and safety regulations in the world and a proactive policy for coexistence with the fisheries and other parties who use the sea.”
According to the Svalbard treaty, which has 46 signature states, Norway holds sovereignty over the island with some stipulations. It regulates the militarisation of the archipelago and allows all signatories to engage in commercial activities there, although only Russia and Norway have done so thus far. As the sovereign state, however, Norway is responsible for the environment and so could veto any oil extraction.
“If Norway wanted to, they could take a stance here,” said Kelman. “We know that fossil fuels are a finite source, so we need to get ourselves off that. Norway and other countries now have the opportunity to reduce their use and extraction of fossil fuel. By looking to the future, Norway could exercise their sovereign right and make it better for the people.”
Norway’s move also risks increasing tensions with Russia, for which the area has huge strategic importance. “In the past few years, Russia has modernised its northern nuclear submarine fleet and expanded their military presence on the nearby Franz Josef Land archipelago,” says Ryggvik. “Formally Russia supports the treaty, but Norway’s move into previously untouched territory could be perceived as aggressive.”
Kelman said: “Irrespective of what Russia is doing in the south, a lot of the analyses we are looking at and incorporating show that Russia does not want provocation in Svalbard or elsewhere in the Arctic. It is to Russia’s advantage to cooperate and keep people on side.
“So when Norway suddenly comes in and says: ‘We’re going to exercise our rights and go for this exploration,’ the open question is: is it really for the fossil fuel or is it to provoke Russia, or a combination of both?”
The deadline to apply for concessions is early 2021, with the aim of their being granted soon afterwards.
This article was amended on 27 August 2020. The open letter from environmental groups referred to the previous eight concession rounds dating back to 2002, not the previous 24 as an earlier version stated. . Among the many larger-than-life characters in Svalbard, the largest is arguably Kim Holmén, the international director of the Norwegian Polar Institute, who makes a Gandalf-like impression with his considerable height, a long beard and a penchant for pithy philosophy and humour (he uses a fluffy polar bear as a lecture aid). He has just returned from a trip trying to explain to 20 ambassadors from around the globe what is happening in the Arctic, and what it means for everyone else. Today, he is giving a speech at the university to an audience mostly from the oil industry.
“We are facing an Arctic that is warmer, wetter, wilder,” he tells them. “It’s happening under our feet.” What happens in Svalbard does not stay in Svalbard, he explains. The jet stream is weakening and weather systems are becoming lazier. Dry fronts linger, which worsens droughts. Wet weather sits longer in one place, which exacerbates floods. The changes in the Arctic are affecting monsoons in India and cold snaps in Japan.
Afterwards, he takes us on a field trip. He takes a rifle from the university arsenal – a legal requirement, because of the danger from polar bears – and we drive along the fjord shore to crags that are home to one of the highly specialised Arctic species in decline. As we get out the car and crunch through the snow, thousands of little auks tweet in waves as they soar and plunge across the landscape. “What we are hearing right now is something that fewer and fewer people will hear in the future, because of the changes taking place,” Holmén says. The small birds are struggling to find food because the Arctic plankton on which they depend are being pushed out of local waters by smaller Atlantic plankton, which thrive in the warmer conditions. More than any statistics, he says, it is these changes that count.
Swedish-born Holmén says he came to Svalbard 40 years ago because he believed in the power of science. He wanted to understand what was happening on this frontline and share that knowledge. He now accepts this approach was flawed; it is no longer enough to demonstrate a precise knowledge of the subject. “I’ve spent my whole life looking for the fourth decimal. But we don’t need another decimal. We need feelings and action. Feelings aren’t rational, but they are real.”
It may be through feelings that Svalbard has most to teach the world: first to try to avoid 4C of heating elsewhere, which still needs a huge amount of work, and then to cope with the disruption that will intensify with every increase of temperatures from now on. The experience here will not apply everywhere. The Amazon, sub-Saharan Africa and the deltas of Bangladesh and Egypt, other regions that will be badly affected by the climate crisis, will never match the resources that this Norwegian territory can throw at the challenge. But lessons about how to allay destabilising anxiety and to change mindsets quickly should be transferable – that and a recognition that, while the risks are greater than many people realise, so is the potential for action.
“Whether you like it or not, adaptation is part of the future,” says Holmén, who declares himself “an optimist, because there is no choice”. “It’s not over until it’s over. There’s always something to save.” . The small group of international scientists, politicians and business leaders are using the Arctic research station as a makeshift conference centre for urgent talks on how to fast-forward a low carbon economy. They have come to the snowy archipelago of Svalbard, a few hundred miles from the North Pole, to hear the latest bad news on melting glaciers and climate change.
""Nowhere are the implications of global warming more visible than in the Arctic. Ecosystems as well as livelihoods are presently undergoing rapid change. In spite of all the evidence provided by science, most governments in the world have failed to take the necessary action,"" warns Anders Wijkman, the Swedish MEP who is chairman of this special symposium.
After hearing predictions that 30% of species could be extinct and a fifth of Bangladesh underwater before 2100, he urges the removal of ""all subsidies on fossil fuels"" and a much stronger commitment to renewable power in measures to build a sustainable future.
Yet outside the room, in the grey Arctic waters, an oil rush looms which threatens more carbon emissions and the risk to the natural world of an accident similar to the 2010 Deepwater Horizon spill in the Gulf of Mexico.
The drilling also threatens to spark territorial disputes and sabre rattling, such as the bellicose noises made by Argentina over British companies seeking oil off the Falkland Islands.
While the polar bears and arctic fox of Svalbard have grazing rights, the legal standing of different human groups in the region is more fuzzy.
Ny-Alesund research station is a base not just for the Norwegians, who have political jurisdiction, but also for British, Indian and Chinese scientists. Few believe the national bases – Beijing's has huge stone lions outside – are there just for science. They are symbolic political and economic stakes in the future of Svalbard and the Arctic.
Drilling is also under way in earnest off Greenland to the west and in the Barents Sea to the east of Svalbard. Oil price rises and melting ice caps have made the region more accessible for mining, shipping and drilling. Yet ownership of the Arctic seabed is far from clear.
The 1920 Spitsbergen treaty, drawn up after the first world war, gave onshore mineral rights to more than a dozen signatories, including the UK. Yet there are arguments whether Svalbard's coastal waters are part of the Norwegian continental shelf and fall within Oslo's jurisdiction. Fishing rights are disputed between Norway and Russia.
Trond Giske, Norway's trade minister, says the uncertainty should not be exaggerated. ""On our part we have no problem interpreting the treaty. We have very few conflicts with other countries in this area,"" he argues, pointing to agreement with Russia last year to settle territorial boundaries in the Barents Sea.
The impact of that deal over the ""grey zone"" only brings oil drilling wealth closer to Svalbard's islands – and increases pressure on Oslo to debate limits to its sovereignty.
Diana Wallis, a British lawyer and former MEP, touched a raw nerve with Norway in a speech to the local European Movement in Tromso. She talked of ""unresolved disputes around Spitsbergen"" and insisted the EU had a legitimate interest in this and the wider Arctic.
Wallis said: ""The position of Svalbard needs to be discussed openly and I can't see why everyone is nervous about this. They seem to be waiting for a trigger event [like an oil find] and then we are going to have a real problem.""
A wider debate does not seem to be what countries licensing drilling operations off Alaska, Russia and Greenland want to hear. They have been happy to confine dialogue to an Arctic Council largely composed of states surrounding the Arctic Ocean. And they say territorial disputes – for example, between Canada and the US over seaways – are all being handled through the UN convention on the law of the sea.
They are determined to defend their right to introduce national oil regulations – which environmental groups and the global community are beginning to challenge.
""Like it or not, what is happening in the Arctic and how it is dealt with becomes everyone's business,"" said Wallis. ""This is an issue which Norway and other Arctic states have to accommodate. A growing number of players have a legitimate interest in what happens in the Arctic and therefore the governance regime there.""
While Greenpeace has physically tried to halt drilling off Greenland and future operations off Alaska, Norwegian environmental group Bellona is waging a war of words with Oslo. Its leader, Frederic Hauge, said: ""It's a big, big, big gamble exploring for oil in this area. There are so many stress factors here – be it the fish, the nuclear waste from the cold war and the fragility of the ecosystem. I am also very worried about the geopolitics of the Arctic. We are acting like petroholics and I do not believe there is widespread support for it.""
Norway's state energy company, Statoil, has its commercial compass pointing north, believing there is nothing to stop its deep water experience of the northern North Sea being safely applied to the Arctic or sub-Arctic.
Statoil points out it has been operating the first Arctic offshore gas field at Snohvit, using subsea technology and underwater links to shore, since 2007. The company – 67% owned by the government – has signed a strategic exploration and production deal with Russia's state-owned oil group, Rosneft. Statoil is also helping another Russian state company, Gazprom, build the huge Arctic offshore gas field, Shtokman – said to hold more gas reserves than remain in all Norway.
Hauge points to the irony of more fossil fuels being developed in an area where the impact of their carbon production is most acute.
Giske sees no contradiction between Norway's physical search for hydrocarbons and the hunt for low carbon solutions at Ny-Alesund. ""We are all going to be dependent on fossil fuels for a long period and natural gas is the bridge into a low carbon world,"" he says. ""If the EU replaced all its coal-fired power stations with natural gas it would easily meet its 20/20 (20% reduction in carbon emissions by 2020) goal.""
He is more concerned about EU energy commissioner Günther Oettinger's recent visit to Oslo to push a new regulatory regime. Oettinger is arguing that Europe is a key customer of Norwegian oil and gas and points to Norway's membership of the European Economic Area as a reason why a common offshore safety regime would make sense.
Giske said Norway and Britain had more experience than anyone else in Europe – over 40 years – so why change a system that has worked well.
Meanwhile, Norway has moved the headquarters of its army from Oslo to a northern town, Bardufoss, and signed its biggest ever single military contract for jets to be located there.
Who is the enemy? Russia? ""No,"" says Giske. China? He almost chokes at the suggestion. ""Look we don't need to identify an enemy to justify defence expenditure. We are after all part of the Nato alliance.""
In Ny-Alesund, there is no discussion of a new cold war over Arctic minerals, with Wijkman more worried about warming. He urges ministers to ""raise awareness among the public about the serious risks posed by climate change and the necessity of urgent action"".

The initiative, along with a ban on heavy fuel oil, is welcomed by both locals in Longyearbyen and Arctic expedition cruise operators.
The days may be numbered for mega cruise ships in the waters around Norway’s Arctic archipelago of Svalbard.
“It is now necessary to protect the wilderness and cultural heritage values at Svalbard from the increased pressure caused by both tourism and climate changes,” says Norway’s minister of environment Ola Elvestuen.
Minister Elvestuen initiates an action plan he said will “consider several targeted measures.”
A press-release by the government highlights four targets; expanding the existing ban on heavy fuel oil, limit the size of cruise ships, stricter rules to avoid disturbing polar bears and restrictions on landings at vulnerable places.
It’s a paradox, but global warming opens more Arctic waters for vessels with tourists who want to see the sea ice before it melts away.
The number of cruise ships to Svalbard, and their size, has increased year-by-year. While the larger cruise ships holding thousands of passengers sail the normally ice-free waters off the west coast of Spitsbergen, more and larger expedition ships sail the icy waters north and east of Spitsbergen which is the largest island on the archipelago of Svalbard.
In Longyearbyen, the main settlement on Svalbard, locals more than welcome the initiative by the government in Oslo to put an end to port-calls by mega cruise ships, some arriving with more tourists than inhabitants in the town. “Everyone Svalbardposten has spoken to, support the suggestions,” the local newspaper reports.
The proposed general ban on sailing with heavy fuel oil (HFO) at Svalbard is welcomed by the Association of Arctic Expedition Cruise Operators (AECO).
“By formalizing this ban, the expedition cruise industry is sending a message to decision-makers that it is time to act to protect the Arctic from the risk of HFO pollution,” said Frigg Jørgensen, Executive Director of AECO.
The association represents the great majority of operators that offer expedition cruising in the Arctic, typically with vessels with an average capacity of 150 to 200 passengers.
Jørgensen said she hopes other Arctic nations and the International Maritime Organization (IMO) will follow Norway’s lead.
Today, ships are not permitted to use or carry heavy fuel oil when sailing in the nature reserves on the east side of Svalbard or in the three large national parks along the west coast of Spitsbergen.
The Governor of Svalbard, in charge of imposing the environmental regulations, informs that ships sailing these areas must use light marine diesel, which will be less severe to the marine life and coastal fauna in the event of a spill.

“Some months have seen temperatures in the area around Longyearbyen with as much as 12-14 degrees [Celsius] over normal,” says climate researcher Ketil Isaksen with the Norwegian Meteorological Institute.
With March coming to an end, it has been 100 consecutive months where every month has been above normal.
“Some months have seen temperatures in the area around Longyearbyen with as much as 12-14 degrees over normal,” says climate researcher Ketil Isaksen with the Norwegian Meteorological Institute.
Since 1961, the average temperature at Longyearbyen airport has increased with 5.6 degrees Celsius. For comparison, measurements at the meteorological institute in Oslo show an increase of 2 degrees for the same period.
The old saying “the Arctic heats twice as much as the rest of the world” is not accurate anymore. Climate changes impact on the Arctic is worse, up to six times higher than global temperature increase.
Located at 76° North, Longyearbyen is the world’s northernmost permanent settlement.
A new normal
If global emissions continue to increase like today, annual average temperature at Svalbard will be above zero degrees by the end of this century, the meteorological institute predicts.
As reported by the Barents Observer in February, a new comprehensive climate impact study for Svalbard suggests the archipelago could become 10 degrees warmer by 2100. Consequently, permafrost will thaw and more heavy rainfall will trigger landslides and costal erosion.
In Longyearbyen, people already have a first hand knowledge on what it means to live in what likely is the world’s fastest warming town.
Houses are sagging as the ground underneath is melting. Stable permafrost is long gone for the 2,200 inhabitants 1,300 kilometers north of the Arctic Circle.
Isfjorden (The Ice Fjord) northwest from Longyearbyen hasn’t been ice-covered mid-winter for the last 10 years. Researchers says the fjord’s marine life is changing from Arctic to Atlantic climate zone.
On March 13th, Arctic sea ice likely reached its maximum extent for the year, at 14,78 million square kilometers, according to the National Snow & Ice Data Centre with the university of Colorado. The centre is leading in satellite studies of sea ice changes in the Arctic.
2019 sees the seventh lowest sea ice in the 40-years satellite record, the centre informs. This year’s maximum extent is 860,000 square kilometers below the 1981 to 2010 average maximum.

Health:
The University Centre in Svalbard (UNIS) is located in Longyearbyen at latitude of 78° North. It is a small town of approximately 2 200 inhabitants which has its own local hospital. The nearest regional hospital is located in Tromsø, Norway, a two-hour flight away.
A large part of UNIS’ activities includes field work which often takes place far from Longyearbyen and with limited access to medical assistance. On some of the excursions, participants are transported several days away from Longyearbyen by ship. They work in the field often without radio contact to the ship. Also during winter, fieldwork is conducted in remote areas by use of snow scooters as transportation. This kind of fieldwork requires that the participants are in good physical condition. A medical emergency will, in these situations, require an ambulance helicopter. Due to the large distances, rapidly shifting weather conditions and uncertain communications in some areas, this might take some time.
As a course- or project participant you have an obligation to report chronic conditions or other health related conditions, which could be of importance when it comes to accomplishing the most demanding field activities. Please contact UNIS prior to your arrival if you have any questions related to health issues and how it might affect your stay in Svalbard.

Course requirements:
Enrolment in a relevant PhD programme. Students should have a minimum of 15 ECTS in chemistry, and 7.5 ECTS in mathematics.
Academic content:
Svalbard is located in a remote area of the Arctic in the highest Northern latitude, however it is still well connected to the rest of the world through dynamic atmospheric and marine currents. The Arctic environment receives contaminants from both long-range transport from mainland Europe, North America and Russia, as well as local anthropogenic inputs from such as coal mining, which powers the town of Longyearbyen. Moreover, the Arctic exhibits unique environmental conditions including long periods of Arctic summer and polar night, extreme temperatures, dry air and strong wind. These particular physical conditions will affect the environmental chemistry we will measure in the class and plays a role in affecting persistence (lifetime) and distributions of contaminants in the Arctic environment. Climate change is expected to play a role, yet unspecified, in this process.
Specific topics:
- Processes and behavior of Arctic main contaminants
- Long distance transportation of persistent organic compounds and black carbon
- Black carbon local emissions in relation to fossil fuel and coal burning
- Coal dust impacts on snow due to local mining activities
- Trace metal pollution in the Arctic
- Mercury in the Arctic environment, sources, occurrence, mechanisms of toxicity and impacts
- The real “POPs” defined: persistent, bioaccumulative, toxic (PBT)
- Arctic conditions that affect “P” and “B” in PBT
- Chemistry of the polar environment
- Contaminant storage in ice in the Arctic and the effects of a changing climate.
- Forecasting and hindcasting movement of contaminants through the Arctic atmosphere: the application of models

The course will provide an interdisciplinary survey of tools for assessing the merit, challenges, and risks of different potential renewable energy exploration and development choices in the rapidly changing Arctic.
Learning outcomes
Successful students in this course will be able to identify key considerations, assess strengths and weaknesses of different disciplinary approaches, and be able to marshal appropriate information to develop a targeted set of recommendations for sustainable harvesting and use of energy in the Arctic.
Knowledge
Upon completing the course, the students will:
- be familiar with terminology in energy production, distribution and storage in remote polar areas
- have knowledge about present energy use and production in Longyearbyen
- be able to describe present challenges in Arctic energy supply and use, both locally (in Longyearbyen) and across the Arctic
- understand present-day considerations about Arctic energy development technically, environmentally, as well as socially
- identify strengths, weaknesses, and the most important interactions between different disciplinary perspectives.
Skills
Upon completing the course, the students will:
- define a scope of work that is tractable, but that also represents a meaningful academic contribution
- apply appropriate disciplinary theory to assess opportunities, challenges, and risks in future Arctic energy development.
General competences
Upon completing the course, the students will:

- generate new competency by integrating lecture and written material with preexisting knowledge
- gather necessary information from lecturers, students, and other resources in a small group project
- effectively communicate practical recommendations on energy production in oral and written form.
Learning activities:
The course extends over ca 3 weeks including compulsory safety training and is run in combination with AGF-853. Required advanced reading will provide a survey of relevant issues and background knowledge as well as selected case studies. Lectures will provide a foundational disciplinary framework for analysis. Group exercises as well as excursions and fieldwork will be used to apply knowledge from lectures and written material. Individuals will be tasked with compiling a subset of the information required by their group in the self-study time. Groups will have ample time to integrate their knowledge and assessment into a written recommendation in the form of a white paper and an oral presentation on their recommendation. See bottom of page for possible white paper subjects.
The excursions and field work vary from year to year but is based on visits to local energy producers and users (power station, coal mine, airport, sports hall). Plans are ongoing to also do a small fjord-cruise to examine locations for wind, wave and tidal energy production.
Total lecture hours: 30 hours
Total group exercises and writing sessions: 16 hours
Excursions and fieldwork: 2 days
Compulsory learning activities:
Participating in all excursions and fieldwork, as well as at least 80% of the lectures.
All compulsory learning activities must be approved in order to be registered for the final assessment.
Assessment:
|Method||Time||Percentage of final grade|
|White paper||Submitted after the course||70%|
|Oral presentation||30%|
A revised and final version of the white paper shall be submitted by the group about 4 weeks after the oral presentation.
Each assessment is graded, and subsequently combined into a single grade. Partial grades for each assessment will be available.
Application deadline: 15 February 2021
Suggested student projects that will be the basis for the white papers, these can be modified by the students:
- How effective is energy use in the Arctic? Locally in Longyearbyen or pan-Arctic.
Using energy effectively is one of the best ways to lower environmental impact because both production, storage and transport usually requires energy use too. Are there systematic difference between the Arctic and warmer regions?
- Impact of different new sustainable energy sources. Locally or Arctic wide.
Any production of energy will have an impact on the surrounding environment, but the impact may differ substantially regionally. This task should seek to give an impact overview to guide decision makers in the future.
- Social acceptance of sustainable energy – are Arctic people ready for change?
This task would require making interviews with the local people in Longyearbyen, and estimate their willingness to make substantial changes in their lives.
- Snowmobiles in 2030 on Hydrogen or batteries?
Driving snowmobiles is one of the major leisure activities in Longyearbyen, and quality of life would be very different if people should let go of this activity in a sustainable future. Can they run or batteries – or hydrogen?
- Electric cars in Longyearbyen – good or bad?
Electric energy is coal based in Longyearbyen, so electrical cars does not necessarily lead to less CO2 release. Electric cars also have issues with heating.
- Is solar and wind energy enough for Longyearbyen?
Based upon the wind and sunshine statistics of Longyearbyen, the sizes of a wind or a combined wind and sun power system should be estimated. An energy storage will be needed, the options of electrical batteries, hydrogen etc. should be considered and evaluated.
- Hydrogen as the main source and storage of energy in the Arctic.
Hydrogen is one of the most promising energy sources that can provide long-term storage and also be shipped much like fossil fuel today. What are the challenges for using Hydrogen in cold environments?
- Personal economy of energy use.
Should we all invest in big batteries and solar roofs in our houses? How is this different in the Arctic, where all the sun is in the summer, and we need a lot of heating in the winter?
- The development of energy in the Arctic as a potential source of international conflict.
As the Arctic region becomes more accessible, to what extent will the exploration and development of energy resources increase conflict between states? How might diplomacy and forums like the Arctic Council address international tensions?
- The “free heating” paradox.
Today, Longyearbyen has abundant hot water for heating. The hot water is “free waste energy” from the coal fired electrical power plant. If a transition to power production from renewable sources is taking place, this free hot water supply will disappear. Use of heat pumps utilizing seawater or shallow geothermal energy may then be an option. What will such a heating system look like? What kind of system sizes are needed, what is the impact of improved insulation of houses? .  . ",True,True,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False

Sailing to 34 key communities along the scenic Norwegian coast Go to Norwegian Coastal Express . Hurtigruten is the world leader in exploration travel, and the world’s largest expedition cruise company. This comes with a responsibility to ensure that sustainability is integrated across all of our operations. With the UN Sustainable Development Goals as a framework, we focus on innovation, technology and concrete measures to explore as responsibly as possible.
Hurtigruten has been operating in and exploring some of the most challenging waters in the world since 1893; our roots go back to the Norwegian polar heroes. Today we are facing the greatest and most difficult challenges in our more than 125-year history. Climate change, plastic waste and unsustainable mass tourism, which are all altering vulnerable ecosystems and threatening wildlife.
As we enter a new era of expedition crusing and adventure tourism, Hurtigruten aims to raise and set new standards for the enture travel industry.
That is why we
are building the first ever hybrid-electric powered expedition cruise ships
are the first major travel company to have removed single-use plastic from all our entire fleet and our hotels
invest in educating our guests and creating ambassadors for every destination on every voyage through actively engaging guests in the cultures we visit, the ecosystems we explore, and the consequences of climate change we observe
UN Sustainable Development Goals as a framework
Our business and operations directly impact many of the UN Sustainable Development Goals, especially those linked to responsible consumption and production, climate action, life below water, and more. This is where we believe we can have the most positive impact--for society as a whole and for our business, both now and in the future.
In addition, we have chosen four SDG goals that represent our very foundation, our licence to operate. These are goals related to quality education, gender equality, peace, and justice. They represent the values that sit at Hurtigruten's core, and are embedded in everything that we do.
Building on our passion, competence and heritage, Hurtigruten – with our dedicated crew and staff - is determined to address these challenges. We will leave behind a footprint we are proud of, contribute to sustainable development and create positive change through our operations.
Sustainable operations: Respecting and protecting wildlife and destinations
Exploring some of the most spectacular wildnernesses on our planet - and visiting the cultures that call them home - is an important part of every Hurtigruten voyage. This obligates us operate with respect and sensitivity. Hurtigruten is taking the lead in preventing degradation by mass tourism, respecting indigenous communities, and providing experiences without leaving permanent impacts, except for the impressions on all our explorers.
Science, innovation and technology
Hurtigruten is setting a new industry standard by building the world’s first hybrid-electric powered expedition cruise ships. These revolutionary ships are packed with green technology, and will be the backbone of the greenest and most advanced fleet of expedition ships than the travel industry has ever seen. Hurtigruten implemented a voluntary ban on heavy fuel oil more than a decade ago, and advocates for the rest of the industry to follow.
Plastic, pollution and cleaner ocean
Hurtigruten was the first major travel company to remove single-use plastic from all of our ships, restaurants and hotels. We are constantly improving how we reduce, recycle and handle our waste – and are sharing everything we learn along the way. Our crews and guests collect metric tons of waste from beaches every year and are educated and trained in conservation. Hurtigruten spreads awareness about pollution in every way we can, engages in strategic partnerships, works with relevant organisations, and conducts research and real time monitoring of the oceans.
Gender Equality Policy
Hurtigruten is committed to fulfill our responsibility to respect and uphold human rights.
All employees of Hurtigruten shall be given equal opportunities for employment and professional development, regardless of their gender, ethnic and cultural background, religion, age, sexual orientation, functional ability, and political view.
Hurtigruten Foundation
Hurtigruten established Hurtigruten Foundation to ensure that our guests of tomorrow can enjoy the same meaningful travel experiences as our guests do today. Hurtigruten Foundation is funded by onboard activities and donations, and focuses its efforts around three main pillars: Conserving the world’s marine widlife, fighting against marine and plastic pollution, and supporting local and global projects in the areas Hurtigruten explores.

Polar bears appear to be white, but underneath all that fur they’re actually black! The fur itself is translucent, so it looks white as it reflects the light of the Arctic ice. Unlike their land cousins, polar bears are classified as marine animals. This is because they spend most of their time not on solid land, but on the frozen flats of sea ice where their food supplies are found.
Polar bears have an extraordinary sense of smell. They can smell prey from over a kilometre away; this comes in handy when they need to find the breathing holes used by seals. Their sense of smell is so keen, they can even detect a seal when it’s a metre under the compacted ice and snow. A polar bear will wait a long time for a seal to come up for air!
Polar bears are always seen above ground, but they can actually swim for days at a time to reach another ice flat. They have very large paws to help them swim, while their hind legs act as a rudder. They can reach speeds of 10 kilometres per hour over long distances. . The Svalbard Polar Bear

We use all our expertise and 120 years of experience in these waters to try and navigate the ice in order to access areas for you to explore. One such site is Kongsfjorden, one of the most beautiful fjord areas in Spitsbergen, with mighty glaciers calving icebergs into the sea, framed by stunning mountain formations. We also plan to call on the former mining settlement of Ny-Ålesund, now an international centre for research, with a picturesque mix of old and new buildings. There will likely be many other exciting landings and scenic kayaking opportunities if we are able to move past the ice and go further north. Day 3-5North West Spitsbergen National Park

- Day 6-8Eastern Svalbard Nature Reserve
Enjoy Expedition Days in the Arctic
Eastern Svalbard boasts the highest population of polar bears in the archipelago. You will also be exploring the area in summertime, which is when polar bears and their cubs will be out hunting for seals on the ice floes. We therefore have high hopes that you’ll spot one or more during this journey.
The Arctic Ocean in this part of Svalbard is also full of drifting ice and its frozen seascape changes constantly. Being modern-day explorers, the captain and the Expedition Team will be carefully analysing the density and movements of the sea ice using advanced sonar and live satellite imagery. They will then discuss together and decide where we can safely sail or land. This is what makes this cruise an expedition; it is a true, suspense-filled adventure into the Arctic’s great wilderness, negotiating and adapting to whatever elements nature challenges us with. Ultimately, it is the sea ice that will determine whether we can cross the 80th parallel and head further north to Sjuøyane (Seven Islands) at the extreme of the Svalbard archipelago. Again, depending on sea and weather conditions at the time, we will sail east of Nordaustlandet to Kvitøya, before continuing towards Edgeøya, the third largest island in the archipelago.

- Day 9-10South Spitsbergen National Park and the area of Bellsund
The Expedition Continues
Our aim for these days is to navigate any sea ice and reach the southernmost tip of Spitsbergen. The varied geology here at Hornsund has created a dramatic and photogenic landscape. Ice pushed into the fjord early in the season also attracts polar bears that hunt on the floes, so with a bit of luck, we may spot this magnificent predator.

MS Spitsbergen will take you on a voyage beyond the ordinary. She cruises along the Norwegian coast from September to May, and becomes part of our global Expedition sailings during the rest of the year.
Read more about MS Spitsbergen . The Svalbard Polar Bear
Polar bears appear to be white, but underneath all that fur they’re actually black! The fur itself is translucent, so it looks white as it reflects the light of the Arctic ice. Unlike their land cousins, polar bears are classified as marine animals. This is because they spend most of their time not on solid land, but on the frozen flats of sea ice where their food supplies are found.
Polar bears have an extraordinary sense of smell. They can smell prey from over a kilometre away; this comes in handy when they need to find the breathing holes used by seals. Their sense of smell is so keen, they can even detect a seal when it’s a metre under the compacted ice and snow. A polar bear will wait a long time for a seal to come up for air!
Polar bears are always seen above ground, but they can actually swim for days at a time to reach another ice flat. They have very large paws to help them swim, while their hind legs act as a rudder. They can reach speeds of 10 kilometres per hour over long distances. . - Comfortable and intimate expedition experience aboard refurbished MS Spitsbergen
- Attempt to sail above 80°N and fully circumnavigate the entire archipelago
- Summertime offers good chances of sighting polar bears hunting on the sea ice
- See beautiful fjords, glaciers, and icebergs in the pristine Arctic wildnerness
Hurtigruten offers unique expedition cruises to some of the most remote and pristine waters of the world. As with all expeditions; nature prevails. Weather, and ice and sea conditions, sets the final framework for all Hurtigruten’s operations. Safety and unparalleled guest experiences are at all times our top priorities.
All our indicative itineraries are continuously evaluated for adaptions, whether this is due to constraints the elements unexpectedly presents – or exciting possibilities nature and wildlife offer. That is why we call it an expedition.

Svalbard expeditions and excursions
Experience the beauty of the High Arctic wilderness with the experts – we have a dedicated expedition team in Svalbard. The expedition team are there for you and safeguard both explorers and the pristine environment that we sail in and explore. Along with guest lectures and scientists they will enrichen your cruise to Svalbard with knowledge and fascinating insights. . Svalbard
Remote, mysterious and extreme. Explore the Svalbard archipelago, located halfway between Norway and the North Pole. The largest of Svalbard's islands, Spitsbergen, is a land forged by ice, wind and sea. Our expedition-style landings will take you closer to the ghost towns of early whaling stations, spectacular fjords and icebergs, wildlife and the King of the Arctic - the Polar Bear.

Join us as we attempt a full circumnavigation of Spitsbergen, taking in mighty glaciers, peaceful fjords and arctic wildlife under the enchanting midnight sun.
Last Frontier to the North Pole
After an evening flight from Oslo, your expedition starts in Longyearbyen, the town on top of the world. Get a taste of what it feels like to live this far north of the world as you meet the ingenious, resilient and conscientious residents of this unique town. From here, we traverse the stunning terrain of North West Spitsbergen National Park. Explore picturesque fjords, steep mountains and beautiful offshore islands while sweeping the landscape for wildlife.
Polar hope
Eastern Svalbard boasts the highest population of polar bears in the archipelago. Hopefully, over our three-day exploration of Spitsbergen’s eastern seaboard, you’ll spot one or more of these apex predators. The bird cliffs in the region also make bird watching a rewarding activity. Svalbard is home to a wide variety of seabirds including thousands of Brünnich’s Guillemots, gulls and kittiwakes.
Due South
Prepare to explore the wonderfully varied landscape and geology of Hornsund. The rugged, steep mountains, stunning fjords, and rich, colourful vegetation make it one of the world’s most scenic natural corners. After exploring this area, we’ll sail north towards the Isfjord before concluding your expedition in Longyearbyen.
Our Svalbard Attempts are expeditions where we, in true expedition style, challenge the elements and the ice-edge of the Arctic Ocean, to circumnavigate this remote archipelago – in a safe way. Several alternative routes combined with our deep knowledge of the area and flexibility are key factors to giving you the most amazing experience. And if we really manage to circumnavigate Svalbard, it will be one for the books.
- Day 1Oslo / Longyearbyen
From 59º N to 78º N
Your journey begins with an evening flight from Oslo, Norway’s fjord-side city surrounded by forested hills and lakes. The high number of electric cars you’ll see on the roads speaks to the city’s commitment to sustainability that led to it being awarded the title of European Green Capital in 2019. As you explore this green metropolis, you’ll discover its booming arts scene, modern beauty and culinary delights.
Thanks to an efficient and well-connected public transport system, every area is accessible without using a car, so make use of the buses, trains and trams while you’re here! You can even tour the city on an Oslo city bike, admiring the work of Oslo’s world-renowned architects out in the open air.
With no shortage of cultural experiences, you can spend the day visiting some of Oslo’s many excellent museums and contemporary art galleries. See the home of one of Oslo’s most celebrated cultural icons, Henrik Ibsen. Soak up the history of Norwegian Polar exploration at Fram museum, which has countless displays and the chance to step aboard a polar ship. Discover what it must have been like to live and work on it as you explore the deck and cabin rooms.
When you need to rest, you’ll find plenty of options for enjoying traditional Norwegian dishes or New Nordic cuisine. Choose from cosy cafés, hip coffee shops, modern fine dining, hot dog stands and the many microbreweries.
As a metropolitan city surrounded by nature, Oslo offers a variety of activities. If you have time, you might take a walk in the forested hills that frame the city. Or you could simply spend the time you have relaxing in one of the city’s many parks before your flight to Longyearbyen in the Svalbard Archipelago.Day 1Oslo / Longyearbyen
From 59º N to 78º N
- Day 2Longyearbyen
The Norwegian Stronghold in the High Arctic
Estimated time of departure is 8:00 PM
After an overnight stay in your hotel, you’ll have the opportunity to explore the colourful frontier town of Longyearbyen before boarding your ship in the afternoon. This is a small town on the island of Spitsbergen, where the 2,000 inhabitants are outnumbered by snowmobiles.
Walk up to the church just a few minutes away. Maybe you will encounter the Svalbard reindeer that are often walking around town minding their own business. Although wild, you’ll find them more curious and tamer. Stroll the main street, admiring the colourful buildings and picking out souvenirs and gifts from the shops of the world’s northernmost town.
During your visit, have lunch at one of Longyearbyen’s impressive restaurants and spend some time learning about the history and wildlife of the archipelago at the Svalbard Museum. Before entering most public buildings, make sure to remove your shoes! This is a custom that originated in the mining days to prevent people from trekking coal dust indoors, and is just one way the town’s mining history continues to affect its culture.
Polar bears live outside Longyearbyen, and while it’s rare to see one in town, keep an eye out for art inspired by these iconic Arctic bears. See if you can find the polar bear statue, or the giant polar bear mural in the centre of town.
Once aboard the ship, you’ll pick up your complimentary expedition jacket, settle into your cabin and attend a mandatory safety drill. Locate the restaurants, Science Center, observation deck and Explorer Lounge and Bar - you’ll be spending a lot of time here. We’ll then say a fond farewell to Longyearbyen as we start our journey of discovery.Day 2Longyearbyen
The Norwegian Stronghold in the High Arctic
- Day 3-4North West Spitsbergen National Park
Exploring Amazing Fjords with Fascinating History
Leaving behind what little civilisation there is, we now enter full exploration mode. In these beautiful yet remote areas, there is no internet, nor are there telephone masts to provide a mobile phone signal.
Free from emails and text messages, this is therefore your rare opportunity to disconnect and detox from the modern world. It's time to really get back in sync with what truly matters.
North West Spitsbergen National Park embodies Arctic beauty in all its rugged, untouched glory. This is a wilderness of steep mountains, stark glaciers and eerily beautiful offshore islands. It’s also one of those rare spots of the world where natural beauty and fascinating history combine. Here, you’ll find the largest concentration of graves, blubber ovens and other cultural treasures from Svalbard’s first explorers.
Weather and sea conditions will determine which areas we’ll attempt to visit. Kongsfjorden is one of the most beautiful fjord areas in Spitsbergen, with panoramic coastal views and a lush alpine tundra. Framed by dramatic mountain formations, you might catch sights of glaciers calving icebergs into the sea.
We may also call on Ny-Ålesund, a culturally rich former mining town now transformed into an international science centre. With a picturesque mix of old and new buildings, it hosts a variety of research stations from different countries dedicated to the study of glaciology, wildlife, and climate change.
The north-west corner of Spitsbergen is a birdwatching mecca in the summer months. You’ll also scan for wildlife, including whales, bearded seals, walruses, Svalbard reindeer and the ‘Lord of the Arctic’ himself, the mighty polar bear. With a bit of luck, you’ll be able to spot one or more of these apex predators as they trek along the coast’s drifting ice on the hunt for seals.
The stunning terrain of this region makes it ripe for outdoor adventure. We’ll attempt to take full advantage of any opportunities that come our way. Activities might include using our expedition boats to come ashore for hiking, participating in a beach clean-up or launching our kayaks.Day 3-4North West Spitsbergen National Park
Exploring Amazing Fjords with Fascinating History
- Day 5-7Eastern Svalbard Nature Reserve
Enjoy Expedition Days in the Arctic
Eastern Svalbard boasts the highest population of polar bears in the archipelago. We have high hopes that over the next three days in this region, you’ll spot the elusive ‘Lord of the Arctic.’
In this part of Svalbard, the Arctic Ocean is full of drifting ice, and its frozen seascape changes constantly. Being modern-day explorers, the captain and the Expedition Team will carefully analyse the sea ice’s density and movements using advanced sonar and live satellite imagery. They’ll determine which part of this Arctic wilderness we’ll explore in landings, hikes and optional kayaking opportunities.
If conditions are favourable, we will cross 80° N, sail through the Hinlopen Strait and head south, scouting for walrus and seabirds along the way. This region is home to thousands of Brünnich’s Guillemots, gulls and kittiwakes.
As we cruise through Freemansundet, you’ll marvel at the sight of seabirds soaring against a panoramic backdrop. Not to be confused with its cousin, the fjord, Freemansundet is a sound separating Barentsøya, to the north, from Edgeøya.
We’ll attempt landings along the coasts of Edgeøya or Barentsøya. We might explore Kapp Lee, an excellent site where you will find cultural heritage from all eras of human exploration of Svalbard. If we are lucky, we may meet some of the marine mammals of Svalbard as we head towards the South Cape Land. Day 5-7Eastern Svalbard Nature Reserve

The Expedition Continues
Our aim for today is to reach the southernmost tip of Spitsbergen. Explore the wonderfully varied landscape and geology of Hornsund, a part of the South Spitsbergen National Park. For many, this is Svalbard’s most beautiful fjord.
Hornsund’s rugged, steep mountains, stunning fjords, and rich, colourful vegetation make it one of the world’s most scenic natural corners. As we cruise along the 30-kilometre fjord, you might catch sight of glaciers calving ice in the waters. On a clear day, you may also see the towering Hornsundtind, reaching 1,431 m above sea level.
Hornsund is a known crossing area for polar bear migrations. In fact, up until 1973, the area around Hornsund was popular with polar bear hunters. The old Hurtigruten steamer D/S Lyngen had scheduled stops here in the past to serve trappers in the area.
Fertilisation from Little Auk colonies found here, is responsible for the surprisingly green patches you might encounter in landings. The lush tundra around the bird colonies attract fauna, including Svalbard reindeer and Arctic fox. Other animals to keep an eye out for are seals and whales when we’re sailing in the ocean.
Hornsund’s other residents are the scientists based at the Polish Polar station. Established here in 1957, the station serves as a research centre for disciplines such as climate change, glaciology, and seismology
In the evening, we’ll start our journey north as we sail past Bellsund towards Isfjorden. Day 8South Spitsbergen National Park and the area of Bellsund
The Expedition Continues
- Day 9The Isfjord
Fjord, Wilderness
Today we sail into the remarkable Isfjord, the most prominent fjord system in the Svalbard archipelago. Leading out to many smaller fjords, it forms a lush and beautiful system rich in wildlife and vegetation. Prepare to explore immense U-shaped valleys carved out of the mountains by giant glaciers some ten thousand years ago.
To the north of the fjord, Alkehornet is a prominent landmark. It’s an imposing example of carbonate rock, with a horn-shaped mount at its peak. Naturally, the surrounding wildlife has conquered it. Arctic fox might be spotted here, as well as Svalbard reindeer and thousands of guillemots and kittiwakes.
It is noticeable how well traces of early human presence have been preserved in Isfjorden. You can find cultural remains of Svalbard’s whaling and hunting heritage along the beaches and bays, such as hunting stations and tryworks.
A more modern cultural icon is further south of the fjords. Here lie the buildings of the famous Isfjord Radio station, a former radio and weather station established in 1933 that now serves as undoubtedly, one of the most beautifully situated hotels in the world.
The landscape of the inner parts of Isfjorden is constantly changing. Still, we have several good landing sites in this area, and we will decide where to go and what to do based upon weather and ice conditions when we arrive. Day 9The Isfjord

End of the Expedition
Estimated time of arrival is 6:00 AM
Your Arctic adventure around Svalbard is over for this time. As you wind down from your expedition, you’ll have some time to look back on all your new memories, still holding onto that elated feeling of having just been quite literally near the “top of the world.”
After saying goodbye to the ship and its crew, you’ll take a transfer to the airport for your flight back to Oslo. If you want to spend more time in Longyearbyen, you can extend your stay with one of our Post-programmes to really get to know the area.
In Longyearbyen, you’ll often find many places hold the record for being the most north anything. The world’s northernmost cinema, church, library, high school, supermarket – they’re all here. You can chalk off each landmark with a customary selfie.
You can join the locals for a drink in the world’s northernmost craft brewery. Art lovers will definitely want to make time to visit Galleri Svalbard to admire diverse works of art inspired by the High Arctic.
If you have the time, grab some souvenirs from the local shops before heading home. A toasty Svalbard sweater or a box of local handmade chocolates would make a wonderful gift for family and friends. Svalbard is a duty-free zone and Longyearbyen has a selection of sports and outdoor clothing shops, so you could stock up on supplies for your next adventure!
Whatever’s next for you, we wish you a safe onward journey and look forward to seeing you again! Day 10Longyearbyen / Oslo

coolgeography,https://www.coolgeography.co.uk/gcsen/GCSE_LW_Development_Issues.php ,"Development of cold environments creates opportunities and challenges.
Cold environment areas are often wilderness areas that are extremely fragile, small perturbations within the system can have catastrophic effects. However, there is enormous mineral wealth in the tundra, and the potential for tourism, fishing, hunting and logging. It is for this reason that many of these areas are decidedly under threat from EXPLOITATION. The Russian tundra has been exploited for mineral deposits such as phosphates, gold, tin, natural gas; and most recently the Russian government has announced a plan to use nuclear powered oil rigs to exploit oil reserves in the Arctic Ocean. The USA has the world famous Trans Alaska pipeline which traverses Alaska from its hugely valuable oil fields near to Prudhoe Bay next to the Beaufort Sea in the North of the State southwards to Valdez on the Pacific Ocean. In addition, North American tundra has reserves of gas, gold, silver, iron ore and copper.

Challenges
Extreme temperatures
The tundra is one of our most Northerly ecosystems and covers a huge tract of land running between latitudes of 50°N (where there is no modifying sea influence) to 80°N. This means that winters are long and cold, minimum temperatures are very low, with some mean monthly temperatures as low as MINUS 25°C, with little influence from the sea and ocean currents.
In some areas because of the tilt of the Earth (23.5°) they don't receive any insolation throughout the winter months. These factors make the environment a very difficult place for people to live. Despite this, there are groups of indigenous people such as the Sami in Northern Norway, Sweden and Finland, and the Iñupiat people of Northern Canada
The Iñupiat people are hunter-gatherers, as are most Arctic peoples. Iñupiat people continue to rely heavily on subsistence hunting and fishing. They harvest walrus, seal, whale, polar bears, caribou, and fish. When they are available they also gather food staples such as ducks, geese, rabbits, berries, roots, and shoots. Whales are shared amongst the community and the skin and blubber of Bowhead and other whales, is rich in vitamins A and C. The meat is eaten raw to preserve the vitamins and these vitamin-rich foods contributes to good health in a population with limited access to fruits and vegetables.
Permafrost
Permafrost is permanently frozen ground where soil temperatures have remained below 0 °C for at least 2 years. It develops because of the cold temperatures but the surface layer does melt in the summer. This layer is known as the Active Layer. This poses big challenges in the summer for developing the Tundra because this layer can be very mobile. This moving soil layer can make buildings sink and subside, roads to crack and even make trees topple and fall, so called “drunken Trees”.

In the winter, the water freezes which makes finding water supplies difficult. The freezing soil also expands upwards due to the process of frost heave. This means people have had to adjust. Roads are constructed of gravel, and houses are often built on stilts to reduce the risk of subsidence. The depth of the permafrost is larger at higher latitudes, and the active layer which seasonally melts, increases in size and movement generally as we move to slightly warmer climates. This can be seen on the transect diagram below, from Resolute in Northern Canada to Hay River at lower Latitudes.
Changes in the permafrost from North to South
Inaccessibility
Many cold environments are sparsely populated and have few communication links going through them. This makes them difficult to reach (inaccessible) and people may not be able to rely upon reliable supplies of food and energy. This encourages people to rely upon themselves and be self-sufficient. Some cold environments are ironically more accessible in winter, when frozen roads and roads built on ice (see the McKenzie River ice road below) allow easier passage than on roads that crack and shift in the summer.
The inaccessibility can isolate people but can also carry advantages. Governments can put some of their more sensitive buildings in such areas. In Svalbard, a set of islands to the North of Norway there is the Svalbard Global Seed Vault, where seeds of plants from all over the world are stored in an attempt to insure against the loss of seeds in other gene banks during large-scale regional or global crises.
Infrastructure and buildings
To have buildings in cold environments people have had to adjust how buildings, roads and pipeline are constructed. Buildings can collapse if built on top of melting permafrost and pipes can be damaged in melting soils as they are more likely to move. Roads are more prone to cracks, potholes and land slips in summer.
To adapt to frozen ground
1. Many houses are raised up above ground to prevent subsidence
2. Roads are built on gravel to prevent them cracking with frost heave.
3. Oil pipelines are raised on stilts to prevent melting of the permafrost
To adapt to the extreme cold
1. Many houses have Triple glazing and insolation to prevent loss of heat from the building
2. Many people wear multiple layers to keep warm
3. Geothermal power is used where underground pumps pump water deep underground where it is warmer and then bring that warmed water back to the surface to heat buildings.
4. Buildings have steep pitched roofs to get rid of the snow that falls.

The effort comes as UN efforts have been deemed too slow.
Norway on Friday (6 November) proposed to completely ban the use of heavy fuel oil (HFO) by shipping around the Arctic archipelago of Svalbard.
“A spill of heavy oil will be catastrophic for nature and the environment. But it will also have an impact on the reputation of tourism in Svalbard. Therefore, we must do everything we can to prevent the unthinkable,” Norway’s Minister of Climate and Environment, Sveinung Rotevatn, told NRK about the plans.
According to the minister, a spill around Svalbard could lead to major damage, because heavy oil is difficult to handle amid low temperatures and ice.
In addition, the work of cleaning up would be both costly and complicated in the event of a spill. This is because of large distances, difficult weather, and scarcity of response capabilities in the area.
“Svalbard has very vulnerable nature and large distinctive wilderness areas. Therefore, the government has set high environmental targets for Svalbard, which means that the risk of damage to the environment must be low. A ban on heavy oil that applies to the whole of Svalbard is a natural step to take to reduce this risk,” Rotevatn said in a press release.
At present, there is already a partial heavy oil ban in protected areas around Svalbard in place which only allows sailing if the ship runs on diesel or other more environmentally friendly fuels.
Over the last few years, the number of cruise ships with several thousand passengers visiting the archipelago’s main town Longyearbyen has drastically increased.
HFO has been banned from Svalbard’s national park waters since 2015, and has been banned in Antarctic waters since 2011.
So far, no date for the start of the ban has been set as the proposal for the new regulation is meant to go through a public hearing in parliament.
The push by the government wants this to apply to the entire archipelago.
The Norwegian announcement also comes at a time as researchers rate a proposal to curb ship pollution in the Arctic, weakened to suit Russian interests, would delay meaningful action until the end of the decade.
In February 2020, the IMO and its member states developed a draft regulation prohibiting the use and carriage as fuel of heavy fuel oil by ships in the Arctic.
Under draft plans being negotiated at the International Maritime Organisation (IMO), the UN body responsible for international shipping, restrictions on heavy fuel oil would only come into effect in July 2024.
Arctic shipping study exposes flaws in planned fuel ban
A proposed ban on polluting ship fuel in Arctic waters would only eliminate 5% of the most harmful climate-busting emissions due to a raft of waivers and exemptions, a new study warned on Thursday (3 September).
But a host of exemptions would allow most ships using and carrying HFO to continue to pollute Arctic waters until 2029.
A recent study, published in September by the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT), estimated that if the draft ban had been in place in 2019, around three-quarters of the fleet using HFO would have still been allowed in the Arctic.
According to the findings, the regulation will only reduce the use of HFOs by 16% and the carriage of HFO as a fuel by 30% when it takes effect in July 2024. Overall, it will allow 74% of Arctic shipping to continue with business as usual, the ICCT said.
As the Arctic fleet grows, so will the number of ships that qualify for an exemption, “and the effectiveness of the ban would be further eroded,” the researchers warned.
Reacting to the announcement by the Norwegian government, the Clean Arctic Alliance, an international pressure group, welcomed the “important commitment” taken by Norway. The alliance calls on IMO member states to agree a stronger ban on HFOs in the Arctic region ahead of its November meeting.
“If the IMO’s Arctic HFO ban is approved as currently drafted, it will expose the Arctic to even greater risks associated with HFO throughout the 2020s,” warned Sian Prior, lead advisor at the Clean Arctic Alliance.
“Norway’s commitment to protect the waters and environment of Svalbard must serve as the impetus for greater ambition from Arctic states to agree to a stronger and effective ban on this dirty shipping fuel throughout the Arctic,” Prior said.

By Roger Harrabin
BBC environment analyst
Plastic waste is building up in the supposedly pristine wilderness of the Norwegian Arctic, scientists say.
Researchers are particularly concerned about huge concentrations of microplastic fragments in sea ice.
They say they've found plastic litter almost everywhere in the Arctic they have looked.
Norwegian fishermen are worried that their fish stocks may lose their reputation for being untouched by pollution.
Most of the large plastic waste there comes from discarded fishing gear.
And boat owners admit it will take hundreds of years to overcome a few reckless decades of using the sea as a dump.
Norway's environment minister says politicians in the past haven't fully registered the extent of the problem.
A synthesis report from the Norwegian Polar Institute to the recent Arctic Frontiers conference in Tromsø says there's a great need for more research into the extent of possible harm from plastic.
It says effects have been monitored so far on zooplankton, invertebrates, fish, seabirds, and mammals.
Research shows that up to 234 particles have been found concentrated into just one litre of melted Arctic sea ice. That's much higher than in the open ocean.
Researchers explain that sea ice forms from the top. By unfortunate coincidence, plastic particles also float at the surface, so they get bonded into the ice as it freezes.
They are not yet sure how much of a threat this presents.
But they are worried about the impact on Arctic wildlife if the particles are released as sea ice continues to shrink.
Geir Wing Gabrielsen, one of the paper's authors, told BBC News: ""We are finding more and more plastic waste in Svalbard, where I work. ""The northern fulmar breeds in Svalbard.
""At the end of the 1970s we found very few plastic in their stomachs. In 2013 when we last investigated, some had more than 200 pieces of plastic in their stomachs.
""Other creatures are getting entangled in nets washed up on beaches - like reindeer. Some die because they can't release their antlers - we find them every year.""
He said in southern Norway pollution was dominated by plastics from the home - but in Svalbard 80% of it comes from fishing activities, local and distant.
Surveys suggest that fishing crews are increasingly aware of their responsibilities now.
Jan Roger Lerbukt, manager of Hermes Fishing in Tromsø told me: ""In the past 20 years I've seen a change in awareness in everyone towards protecting the environment.
""Fishing has been in our soul for thousands of years. If there's any environmental threat to the fish it's also a threat to our livelihood and that's a big concern.
""We have a reputation for a pure product and we don't want that damaged.""
He agreed that trawler crews used to throw tangled nets overboard, but says they now they return them to harbour.
He says they also salvage plastic litter they catch, under a scheme called Fishing for Litter.
More and more crews are using paper packaging and moving away from plastic tape, he said.
But on a short walk along a plastic-strewn beach in Skulsfjord near Tromsø, I found clear evidence of fishing ropes still being deliberately cut.

By Øystein Overrein (ed.), Jørn Henriksen, Bjørn Fossli Johansen, Kristin Prestvold
Upon planning a trip to Svalbard, either onboard your own vessel or as passenger on a cruise ship, you are obliged to acquaint yourself with the laws and regulations for traffic in Svalbard. The following is an outline of the most important rules. Through links in the text, the reader may read the full texts of the rules elsewhere. The website of the Governor of Svalbard is a good place to start your reading.
The Svalbard Environmental Protection Act and related regulations came into force in July 2002. The act applies to the islands of Svalbard and the waters out to the territorial border at 12 nautical miles offshore. The introductory regulations regarding duty of care and principles regarding the exercise of authority are as follows:
- Any person who is staying in or operates an undertaking in Svalbard shall show due consideration and exercise the caution required to avoid unnecessary damage or disturbance to the natural environment or cultural heritage (§ 5).
- A head of undertaking shall ensure that every person who carries out work or takes part in the activities for which an undertaking is responsible is aware of the provisions set out in or pursuant to this act regarding the protection of Svalbard’s flora, fauna, cultural heritage and the natural environment otherwise (§ 5).
- Exercise of authority under the act shall build on the precautionary principle and the overall environmental pressure on the natural environment and cultural heritage (§§ 7 and 8).
The following fundamental principle is stated in the act § 73:
All access and passage in Svalbard shall take place in a way that does not harm, pollute or in any other way damage the natural environment or cultural heritage or result in unnecessary disturbance to humans or animals.
Management Area 10
Management Area 10 is roughly the area from the fjord Van Mijenfjorden in the south to the fjord Isfjorden in the north (including Nordenskiöld Land) and also parts of Dickson Land, Bünsow Land and Sabine Land. Traffic regulations applying to this area differ from those outside of this area.
In the provisions there is a distinction between non-resident visitors, residents, tour operators and scientists. The scope here will be the first three groups.
Non-resident visitors
Within Management Area 10 visitors may travel on their own without notifying the Governor of Svalbard. Upon planning a trip outside this area, notification to the Governor of Svalbard is mandatory. In any case, it is wise to start your trip with a stop at the “Svalbardporten” (the Gateway to Svalbard), in Forskningsparken (Research Park) in Longyearbyen, where you can get relevant information from Visit Svalbard in Longyearbyen.
- Visitors staying in the settlements or taking part in activities arranged by tour operators do not need to notify the Governor of Svalbard.
- Visitors planning private trips within Management Area 10 do not need to contact the Governor. The same applies to boat trips within Kongsfjorden and trips within a 20 km radius of Ny-Ålesund.
- Visitors going on longer private trips or expeditions in Svalbard outside Management Area 10 are required to have sufficient insurance or other form of guarantee to cover any expenses incurred by the authorities in connection with search and rescue operations, and are required to notify the Governor prior to the trip and must acquaint themselves with the relevant environmental and safety regulations.
Details are found in “Regulations relating to tourism and other travel in Svalbard”.
A trip to Svalbard outside Management Area 10 must be reported on a special form to the Governor of Svalbard prior to the trip. The planned trip will be evaluated regarding the need for insurance/bank guarantee to cover the cost of search and rescue operations and the transport of patients should the need arise. A registration card will be issued to you when the trip and insurance/bank guarantee has been acknowledged. The registration card must be brought with you on your trip for inspection, and completed and returned to the Governor after the trip.
Safety precautions must be top priority when travelling in Svalbard. The conditions can be challenging in terms of changing weather conditions, winds, difficult waters and landings, sea ice/drift ice, glaciers, fog and polar bears, among other things. More information on safety can be found in the folder “Safety in Svalbard”. Due to the risk of meeting polar bears visitors travelling in Svalbard must always have firearms and protection devices at hand, such as a big-game rifle and ammunition for self-defence, flare gun or an emergency signal flare pen for driving off polar bears and tripwire with flares for camping. To protect yourself against polar bears you need know-how about firearms and experience. For trips outside Management Area 10 it is required to bring an emergency beacon. You should also bring a satellite telephone, as there is limited range for mobile phones in Svalbard. VHF radios also have limited range but may still be useful for communication in some situations.
There are many cabins in Svalbard, and some are not locked. Except in an emergency, a cabin may not be used without the owner's consent.
Residents
Residents are persons listed in the Svalbard population register, as well as Russians residing in Barentsburg and Poles in Hornsund. Residents may travel more freely within Svalbard, but are required to notify the Governor when entering Nordvest-Spitsbergen, Sør-Spitsbergen and Forlandet national parks and Nordaust-Svalbard and Søraust-Svalbard nature reserves. Notification is given on a form to the Governor of Svalbard. Residents may also be required to provide proof of insurance or a bank guarantee for search and rescue operations; registration cards are then issued by the Governor. Residents may use open cabins for short and overnight stays. The passage restrictions detailed below also apply to this group.
Tour operators
You are considered a tour operator if you organize a trip in, or to, Svalbard with pertinent services, such as transport, accommodations and activities, receiving a commission for your work. Tour operators have certain obligations as provided by ""Regulations relating to tourism and other travel in Svalbard"". Tour operatiors must get acquainted with the relevant legislation and regulations, and provide for necessary training of personnel and tourists for whom they have responsibility (see § 5 – Responsibility of tour operators and tourist carriers for the safety and behaviour of participants). See the website of the Governor of Svalbard for more detailed information.
Traffic restrictions
The main points contained in the environmental legislation are outlined below:
- All mammals, birds and their eggs, nests and dens are in principle protected and should not be disturbed.
- The use of ship whistle, firing shots or making other loud noises is prohibited within a distance of 1 nautical mile (1852 m) of bird cliffs between 1 April and 31 August.
- It is prohibited to lure, pursue or in any other active way seek out polar bears so that the polar bears are disturbed or danger is caused for either polar bears or people.
- Carcasses, skeletons and parts of skeletons are properties of the State and are not to be removed from the site.
- All plants are protected against damage and against being picked. Exceptions are damage caused by legal traffic, for instance passage on foot.
- Collection of mushrooms, seaweed and kelp for private use is permitted.
- It is prohibited to leave garbage in the natural environment.
- It is prohibited to burn waste other than paper and clean wood. Driftwood may be used for campfires on site.
- Human (toilet) waste may be buried in the river gravel, below the high tide mark or be thrown in the sea.
- Discharge of waste at sea from ships or other vessels is prohibited. However, waste food and sanitary drainage water may be discharged at sea, in open waters.
- It is not desirable to leave cairns or any other sings of your visit in the natural environment.
Within several of the protected areas there are traffic regulations, including the 15 bird sanctuaries, Moffen and Kong Karls Land, the southern tip of Bjørnøya and another area north on Bjørnøya. Additionally, all traffic is closed in Virgohamna and inside the fence at the point of Gravneset in Magdalenefjorden.
Cultural remains
Cultural remains in Svalbard shall be protected and safeguarded as part of Svalbard’s cultural heritage and identity (The Svalbard Environmental Act § 38).
The following cultural remains are automatically protected:
- Structures and sites dating from 1945 or earlier.
- Movable historical objects dating from 1945 or earlier that come to light by chance or through investigations, excavation or in any other way.
- Elements of cultural heritage dating from after 1945 that are of particular historical or cultural value and that are protected by a decision of the Directorate for Cultural Heritage.
- Evidence of human graves of all kinds, including crosses and other grave markings as well as bones and bone fragments found on or below the surface of the ground and skeletal remains at slaughtering sites for walruses and whales, and associated with self-firing gun traps for polar bears, are considered to be structures and sites and are protected irrespective of their age.
- Around automatically protected cultural remains there is a 100 m security zone extending in all directions (§ 39).
- No person may damage, dig up, move, remove, alter, cover up, conceal or disfigure protected structures and sites or movable historical objects, including within any security zone, or initiate measures that may entail a risk of this happening.
- In the security zone it is not permitted to erect tents, light fires or undetake similar activities.
The Governor may regulate or prohibit access and passage within the security zones around protected cultural remains (§ 42).
Camping regulations
For camping in any area, except the regulated camping grounds in Longyearbyen and Ny-Ålesund, the following requirements apply:
- Tents should be pitched in vegetation-free areas, as far as possible, to reduce the wear on the vegetation.
- Within a 100 m radius of fixed protected cultural remains (including old fox traps), cabins and inhabited settlements camping is prohibited, including pitching of tents and campfires.
- Campfires should always be placed on vegetation-free ground.
- When camping activities come to an end the camp site shall be cleared. Stones, stakes and other objects that have been used to fasten tent canvas or guy ropes or to form shelters, shall be cleared away and replaced where they were found. Campfires shall be cleared and all waste must be removed and delivered to approved reception facilities.
- Any person that plans camping activities lasting for one week or more in the same locality shall notify the Governor’s office of this at the latest three weeks prior to camping.
Fishing for Arctic char
Non-resident visitors are only permitted to fish using fishing rods and handheld fishing lines. All fishing gear that has been used outside Svalbard must be disinfected prior to use. Local residents may be granted permission for gill net fishing. All fishing is prohibited in the nature reserves. Fishing in Svalbard requires a fishing licence, which can be purchased at the Governor’s office.
Dogs on a leash
Dogs must be kept on a leash between 15 May and 15 August according to the general regulations. Northern breeds of dogs, such as samoyeds, huskies, malamutes and cross-breeds in which these strains predominate, shall be kept on a leash or safely confined or fenced in at all times of year.
Other regulations
Please refer to the website of the Governor of Svalbard for further information on current legislation, regulations and maps of protected areas. . The plants in Svalbard differ in many of their characteristics; for example, they may be evergreen (Arctic bell-heather) or deciduous (polar willow), woody (Arctic bell-heather) or herbal (alpine bistort), and they may have roots (all vascular plants) or not (mosses and lichens). The plants’ characteristic traits help determine the types of areas they grow best in, how they respond to growing conditions (impacts), and what types of disturbances they withstand (threats and vulnerability).
Status
The some 160 plants species, 380 mosses and 600 lichens found in Svalbard exist in many different combinations, often referred to as vegetation types, or plant communities. The terrain, substrate type, humidity, exposure to wind and frost, summer temperatures, access to nutrients and how the area is used by grazing animals are among the most significant factors for determining the type of vegetation that grows at a given site. In addition, the plants also affect their own surroundings, and the interactions between plants contribute to the range of impact factors.
On mounds and ridges exposed to wind and frost, we find, for example, vegetation dominated by mountain avens, in community with purple saxifrage or lichens. On slopes, with somewhat more snow cover, we find Arctic bell-heather or grasslands with, for example, alpine meadow-grass. On flatlands and open plains with moderate snow cover, various types of moorland vegetation occur, composed of Arctic wood-rush, polar willow and mosses and lichen. Places where the snow lies longest are referred to as snowbeds, and such hollows are habitats for mosses and many herbs, such as mountain sorrel. On flat areas, with significant seepage, the mosses grow well. It is here that moss-dominated wetlands are created. On drier, slightly sloping substrates, we also find grasses (e.g. polar foxtail), and ferns (e.g. common horsetail), while sedge species, such as Hoppner’s sedge and polar white cottongrass, are common on wetter flatlands. Another type of flat ground are salt meadows, where the salinity determines the prevalence of plants. Fertilizer creates large differences in productivity in Svalbard, notably below bird cliffs, where many different herbs and grasses grow and productivity reaches a high-arctic peak. The polar desert is found on upland terrain and in the north of Svalbard, featuring only sparse vegetation between stone and gravel.
Depending on the choice of spatial scale and methodology, vegetation can be divided into many types and configurations; field surveys and remote sensing naturally yield somewhat different descriptions of the vegetation. The main differences, however, are independent of methodology and follow the overarching growing conditions.
Impacts
One fascinating trait of the plants in Svalbard is that, even though they grow slowly and the individuals are long-lived (from several years to hundreds or even thousands of years, studies show that the plants are able to closely respond to the growing conditions.
Temperature is a decisive factor for high-arctic plants. The polar willow is one of the species that closely tracks summer temperatures, both in its annual secondary growth (through the creation of annual rings, like trees) and in its primary (shoot) growth. The other common plants’ summer production also tracks July temperatures remarkably closely. It follows from this that, even if the annual growth is small, the plants have a potential to change over time.
Most of the plants are also important food sources for some of Svalbard’s herbivorous animals. The Svalbard reindeer, Svalbard rock ptarmigan and different goose species enjoy a varied supply of new shoots and flowers in spring, and grass and herb stems in summer; and some, such as reindeer and geese, also eat mosses. The activity of the grazing animals also naturally affects the plants.
Some of the impacts of grazing on vegetation are relatively well-known; geese may grub up their favourite food (such as alpine bistort) by the roots, and this activity breaks up moss cover on the tundra in addition to removing plant material. In the first instance, this can result in a change from moss to grass- or sedge-dominated vegetation or clearings without vegetation, and in the most dramatic cases these patches appear to remain clear. The vegetation itself helps manage developments in the event of cessation of grazing: among the many vegetation types that are grazed by geese at different times, the most humid have the best resistance and regeneration. Likewise, changes in the main vegetation type have been described as a result of the impact of reindeer, including eating, trampling and fertilizing. For example, a single location, given fundamental growing conditions that are not overly different, can change from being dominated by woody plants to containing mostly grass. The grazing impact of ptarmigan has been little studied in Svalbard, but many plants (such as the alpine bistort in summer and buds and dry inflorescence in winter) are naturally an important resource for ptarmigan. We know less about the combined effects of the grazing animals, but it is conceivable that areas regularly grazed by several of the animals are subject to significantly different grazing impacts than places that are mostly used by only one of the grazers. In line with the plants’ response to temperatures, vegetation responds to grazing from year to year, and fairly large changes in plant dominance may occur on an annual time scale.
It is well-known that the plants’ proximity to each other is significant for the configuration of vegetation in general, for example, the mosses keep the ground moist and cool. This may benefit other species which grow well in damp places but, equally, dense moss cover can prevent new shoots from growing. The net effect of plant communities is a topic for present-day research, and may acquire even greater significance if the environment otherwise continues to change.
Six red-listed habitats have been described in Svalbard: Arctic permafrost-wetland, Arctic steppe, poor fen, bird cliffs, polar desert and hot spring, each of which has its own characteristic vegetation. Work is in progress to map and protect red-listed plant species, including moonwort and tundra birch. Most of the 54 red-listed vascular plants in Svalbard are herbs, grasses or sedges, whereas there are fewer woody plants. The natural explanation of this is that there are in general far fewer woody species growing in Svalbard than representatives from the other groups. Climate change, human traffic, random events such as landslides or floods and grazing are potential threats to red-listed plant species.
Threats/vulnerability
Svalbard’s climate is in transition and climate change is considered to be one of the greatest threats to Svalbard’s ecosystem in general. However, warmer temperatures alone rarely appear to be enough to increase plant growth dramatically, in contrast to research results from low-arctic areas where the tundra is locally being overgrown by shrubs. On the other hand, warming combined with better access to water and/or food may be expected to increase plant growth, to the extent that community-level changes in the vegetation may also be expected in the High North, even if this will happen more slowly. The plant groups which grow rapidly (herbs, grasses) may be expected to have greater potential to increase their dominance than the woody species currently established in Svalbard, since these have relatively slower growth rates. The impact of grazing animals in Svalbard may to some degree be expected to favour grasses, for example, which generally withstand grazing better than plants such as dwarf shrubs. The combined impacts of climate change and varying or altered grazing animal populations are, however, very difficult to predict.
Some vegetation types in Svalbard are locally vulnerable to trampling, and this applies in particular to the wettest types and slopes holding loose material. Since the growth rate is generally slow, trampled vegetation will have a very long regeneration period, and in some cases will not regrow. Human activity also brings with it plants not previously found in Svalbard, and there are a number of introduced species in limited locations. It is uncertain how quickly these new arrivals will find suitable conditions on the archipelago.
Monitoring
Long time series and other studies that seek to distinguish the effects on vegetation of climate, grazing animals and other impact factors, such as introduced species or trampling, are accorded high priority as tools for understanding vegetation patterns and changes by the many research bodies which are studying plants in Svalbard.

As part of a broader investigation into recent environmental change on Svalbard, the inorganic geochemical record of six lake-sediment cores was analysed. The major temporal trends in sediment elemental composition are driven by variations in two contrasting sediment components, both derived from catchment soils: (1) mineral matter, and (2) soil organic matter (SOM), enriched in Fe and Mn oxides and heavy metals. Two environmental impacts are recorded in most or all of the lake sediment sequences. An up-core increase in organic matter can be partly attributed to diagenetic effects, but also requires an enhanced supply of SOM relative to mineral matter. In addition, the central and southern sites all show a ca. 1970 event characterised by an enhanced mineral matter accumulation rate. This requires either an enhanced allochthonous supply or an enhanced mobilisation of littoral sediments. In either case a regional-scale driving force, such as a shift in climate, is required. At five of the lakes the sediment heavy metal concentration profiles can be explained entirely by natural factors. However, at Tenndammen (U), situated close to the Svalbard’s largest settlement at Longyearbyen, possible anthropogenic Pb enrichment is found. Comparison of observed and expected heavy metal profiles (based on Greenland ice-core data) shows that the lakes are generally too insensitive to have recorded a long-transported heavy metal pollution signal.

A large number of mushroom species grow in Svalbard. Most are small, some are poisonous, while others are edible and tasty. Fungi have most of their biomass under ground, invisible for man, and only produce small fruiting bodies aboveground in autumn, in order to reproduce. Their activity makes nutrients available for plant roots. Vegetation in Svalbard would be scarce without fungi and their ability to mediate nutrition to the plants. Fungi are also an important food item for reindeer and various invertebrates.
The picture in the lower right-hand corner shows a Cassiope tetragona with a fungus-infection (Exobasidium). The fungus is not visible as such, but it changes the appearance of the plant and the usually green leaves change colour to red or greenish-white. Exobasidium is an example of the numerous microfungi that also grow in Svalbard
Cap: 2-5 cm, orange red, becoming cracked when older. Gills: pinkish buff. Stem: 2.5 cm high, 0.3-1 cm thick, similar colour as the cap. Flesh brittle, with white latex, slightly bitter taste. Heath vegetation and mesic tundra. Not edible.
Cup shaped and 1.5-3 cm broad, black surface, inside smooth, outside with greyish white, scaly granules towards the margin. Stem: 1-1.5 cm high, 0.2-0.5 cm thick, cylindrical, smooth, and black. Occurs in sparsely vegetated sites, in calcareous soils.
Small, 1-4 cm, fan shaped, undulating and wavy, thin and almost transparent, with irregular veins underneath, grey. Grows on mosses in moist areas, moss tundra, mires, and along creaks and streams. Probably edible, but small.
Cap: 4-6 cm or larger, yellow brown to red brown, sticky. Gills: young pale whitish or occasionally bluish, becoming rusty brown. Stem: 3-7 cm high, 0.5-1.3 cm thick, white, slimy below a distinct ring. Common in tundra dominated by Salix polaris and Dryas octopetala. Not edible.
Cap: 5-12 cm, convex to slightly depressed in the middle, yellow brown to red brown. Gills: beige to pinkish brown. Stem: 4-10 cm high, 1-2 cm thick, similar colour as the cap. Grows many together, fasciculate, often on disturbed ground, along roads and dikes. Edible and very tasty.
Cap: 3-6 cm, convex, buff. Tubes: white-beige. Stem: 4-6 cm high, 1-1.5 cm thick, pale, covered by small scales. Only found together with Betula nana. Edible.
Brightly egg yellow, resembles a miniature chanterelle. Cap up to 2 cm. Grows among mosses and lichens in both mires and heath vegetation. Forms a lichen together with a green algae, visible here as a thin, green crust around the stem base. Edible, but small.
Ball shaped. White as young, densely covered with a layer of fine matted hairs, 7-17 cm in diameter. The mature fruiting body becomes brown with age, dries and breaks open, and releases the brown powdery spore mass as “smoke” over the tundra. Grows in tundra and pastures. Edible when young and white.
Cap: 10-15 cm, white, densely covered with small, thin scales. Gills: first pink, later brownish black. Stem 1.5-2 cm thick, with ring. Known from a handful of places in and around Longyearbyen, occurs in large fairy rings. Edible and very tasty.

Abstract
The increasing number of visitors in polar regions and demand for outdoor extreme ac-
tivities create a pressure on local fragile ecosystems. Two examples of mechanical dis-
turbances of the glacier forefields are presented in this study to demonstrate the impacts
of different frequencies of visits on the local environment. Foxfonna study site expe-
rience only minor disturbances in comparison with the Langjökull study site on Iceland.
This is due to the number of tourists visiting the two localities and also the means of
transportation used for reaching the ice caps. It is likely that with still ongoing increase
of number of tourists coming to these localities, the anthropogenic pressure will continue
to grow. The combination of human pressure and ongoing climate change can have irre-
versible effects on sensitive local environment especially in places easily accessible for
tourists.

Introduction
During the last decades, polar regions
experienced high increase of visitors and
related tourism activities. The quest for ex-
ploring the polar wilderness pushes the
tourist agencies to go further in offering
diverse outdoor activities and continue to
explore new territories. These activities are
necessary to meet the tourists´ demands.
With increasing number of arriving tour-
ists and rise in the offer of local tourist
agencies, negative impacts on local environ-
ment start to occur (e.g. Tverijonaite et al.
2018, Runge et al. 2020). The human pres-
sure together with the effects of climate
change can have significant impacts on an-
imal species, vegetation and the landscape
as a whole. For the moment, most of the
studies dealing with tourism in the Arctic
take into account the possible effect of cli-
mate change on tourism (e.g. Hewer and
J. KAVAN and V. ANDĚROVÁ
60
Gough 2018, Wang and Zhou 2019, Schrot
et al. 2019). Less studied is the opposite,
i.e. the effect of tourism on local environ-
ment which, however, often amplifies the
negative effect of climate change. Some
examples are represented in e.g. Wang et
al. (2019) or Czortek et al. (2018). One of
the recent impacts on local environment is
certainly the use of off-road or all-terrain
vehicles for access to the distant localities
(Hinkel et al. 2017). The importance of
transportation and its effect on reshaping
the local surface was identified long time
ago (e.g. Abele et al. 1984). In the 80ies,
only local inhabitants and local industrial
companies were moving around the settle-
ments. This has, however, changed in the
last decade and tourism related transporta-
tion became the leading sector using off-
road vehicles.
The number of tourists has been con-
stantly increasing in Svalbard. This trend is
well illustrated on the Fig. 1A, where num-
ber of incoming passengers to the Long-
yearbyen airport is plotted. The number al-
most doubled in last decade from 53 000
in 2009 to 90 000 in 2018 ([1] - SSB 2019).
The same trend is obvious from the num-
ber of guests´ nights in local hotels, where
increase from less than 50 000 in late 90ies
to more than 150 000 in 2015 is apparent
(Eeg-Henriksen and Sjømæling 2016).
Similar trend could be observed in case
of Iceland (Fig. 1B, C), where detailed sta-
tistics on arriving foreign passengers to
Keflavik airport is available since 50ies.
The increasing number of arriving tourists
is even more pronounced in comparison to
Svalbard. In 2009 the number of incoming
foreign passengers was 494 000 whereas
in 2018 the number has increased up to
2 344 000. Such enormous increase in num
ber of tourists was accompanied by conse-
quent increase in tourist activities, travel
agencies offers and increase in accom-
modation
capacities. The importance of in-
creasing tourism on the state of the local
environment was obviously recognized in
Iceland as well, Ólafsdóttir and Runnström
(2013) examined the state of hiking trails
and its impact on enhanced erosion in Ice-
landic highlands for example. The climatic
conditions of Iceland, especially strong
winds and precipitation lead to intensive
wind and water erosion (Arnalds et al.
2012), that might enhance the negative ef-
fects of increased tourism.
The objective of the study is to describe
the physical damage on local environment
in means of terrain alterations caused by
heavy transportation directly related to tour-
ism activities. Such damage is described
with use of UAV photography and pub-
licly available aerial photos together with
direct land-based observation.
Study sites
Two study sites of glacier forefields
were investigated during July and August
2019. Their positions are marked in Fig. 2.
Svalbard is located in High Arctic envi-
ronment with rather low precipitation and
long-term average temperatures in nearby
Adventdalen reaching approximately -7°C
(Nordli et al. 2014). On the other hand,
Iceland can be considered as subarctic en-
vironment with higher temperatures and
especially higher precipitation. However,
both localities are rather similar with re-
spect to their landscape context. Both are
located in the vicinity of the ice caps, both
localities are experiencing rather important
glacier retreat in last decades.

Iceland 1949-2018 (C, Ásgeirsdóttir and Karlsson 2016).
Foxfonna, Svalbard
The study site is located about 2 km in
front of Foxfonna, one of the most easily
accessible ice caps on Svalbard, not far
away from the archipelagos´ capital, Long-
yearbyen. The site is frequently visited by
organised groups of tourists, usually with
use of off-road vehicles to reach the ice
cap summit. Even though the Governor of
Svalbard office is rather strict regarding the
environmental protection, substantial dam-
age of ground surface is visible. The study
site itself is located in the northern fore-
field about 2 km off the ice cap edge on
the relatively flat plateau where ice wedged
polygons are very well developed. The Fox-
fonna site represents a remote locality ac-
cessible only for few visitors especially
because of the need to walk for relatively
long distance and be in a good physical
shape. The local tourist agencies advertise
the summer guided trip as moderate to dif-
ficult with necessity to walk approximate-
ly 11 km in rugged terrain and limit the
minimum age of 12 years to attend the trip.
The winter trips are however more acces-
sible due to the use of snowmobiles, all-
terrain vehicles or dog sledges. It is there-
fore especially the winter activities caus-
ing the terrain alterations.

Langjökull, Iceland
Langjökull is the second largest Iceland-
ic ice cap (953 km2) located not far from
the capital, Reykjavík. This position makes
it a perfect touristic spot. Number of tour-
ists reaching Langjökull is much higher in
comparison to Foxfonna study site in Sval-
bard. The Foxfonna site is visited by maxi-
mum of tens persons per day, whereas
Langökull can be reached by hundreds or
even thousands per day. This corresponds
also to the infrastructure which has been
recently developed. On contrary to still rath-
er untouched environment of Foxfonna,
Langjökull is easily accessible by car. Or-
ganised groups are then transported on the
edge of the ice cap with off road buses and
further on the ice cap summit with snow
scooters (Fig. 3).

Material and Methods
Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) was used
for mapping of the Foxfonna study site.
The Yuneec MantisQ drone has recorded
30 minutes 4k video from which 76 select-
ed photographs were used. Structure from
Motion (SfM) technique was used for con-
structing orthophoto and digital elevation
model (DEM). Orthophoto and DEM was
processed in Photoscan Agisoft software. 4
reference points were recorded in the field
with Trimble dGPS device for the period
of 120 seconds for each point. Horizontal
precision of the dGPS reference points was
in average 0.175 m and vertical precision
0.35 m after the postprocessing. The spatial
error of the reference points after align-
ment within the Agisoft environment was
0.82 m. The resulting orthophoto was ex-
ported with 0.03 m resolution and DEM in
0.1 m resolution.

Publicly available aerial photos ([2]) and
direct land-based observation were used to
illustrate the impact of transportation on
the terrain at the Langjökull study site. The
old aerial photo ([3] - National Land Survey
of Iceland database 2019) from August
14th 1986 was used for comparison of the
study site before construction of the trans-
portation infrastructure (photo ID J-7886).
The recent aerial photograph was taken in
August 2018.
Results and Discussion
Substantial terrain alterations were found
in both studied localities. The disturbances
found at Foxfonna site were considerably
smaller in comparison with the Langjökull
site. This is no surprise with regard to the
much lower number of tourists visiting
Svalbard and the locality itself.
The Foxfonna study site and the level
of disturbance is presented in Fig. 4. The
tracks from the off-road vehicles are well
visible crossing the high plateau with well-
developed sorted polygons. The high water
content in the active layer leading to rather
soft and vulnerable surface contributed to
relatively deep impacts of just few vehi-
cles crossing the area. Even though the
tracks are clearly visible on the orthophoto,
the spatial impact on the surface is not de-
tectable on the DEM with 0.1 m resolu-
tion. On the other hand, such tracks persist
for several decades in the bare soil surface
ecosystem of the high elevated plateau.
These tracks are visible for several decades
even on the vegetated tundra surface, where
the potential to recover is much higher,
which could be shown on examples of off-
road operations in the vicinity of polar sta-
tions or nearby the old Russian settlements
on Svalbard.
In case of the Langjökull study site, the
imprints of the transportation are more per-
sistent, especially because of construction
of transportation and logistics infrastruc-
ture directly at the site and relatively high
frequency of visits. 12.9-17.7% of tourists
visiting Iceland has paid for glacier/snow-
mobile guided tours between 2011 and 2016
(Ásgeirsdóttir and Karlsson 2016), which
means approximately 300 000 visitors of
Icelandic glaciers. Considering that Lang-
jökull is the glacier closest to the country´s
capital, where large part of the visitors is
going and have two principal access sites,
it can be estimated that several tens of
thousands of visitros per year can use this
infrastructure. As shown on Fig. 5, the site
near Langjökull glacier haven’t been ac-
cessible by car in late 80ies and the trans-
port facilities have been constructed only
in late 90ies, when the local tourist agency
started to organize the tours on the glacier
surface. Even though the agency stated its
carbon dioxide neutral footprint on envi-
ronment through supporting reforestation
programmes, its impact on the local gla-
cier forefield is inevitable. The footprint
on the landscape is obvious as well as the
tracks on glacier surface. The question of
chemical contamination of the glacier it-
self through the emissions from snowmo-
biles and other vehicles arises apart the
mechanical disturbances. The important im-
pact of snowmobile emissions on Svalbard
environment was reported e.g. by Reimann
et al. (2009) or Aamaas et al. (2011). Apart
the direct emissions ranging from 2.5 g/km
to 69 g/km depending on type of engine,
Reimann et al. (2009) also reported that
large part of the fuel leaves the engine un-
burned and contaminates the surface direct-
ly with the fuel.

(B) with an oblique close up focused on disturbed ice wedged polygons on the high elevated
plateau and Adventfjord with Longyearbyen, the Svalbards’ capital, in the background (C).
Burning huge amount of fossil fuels
(the average consumption of a snowmobile
ranges from 13.1 to 18.1 l/km according to
the survey of Reimann et al. 2011) direct-
ly on the glacier surface might contribute
to elevated levels of certain chemical com-
pounds (i.e. aromatic hydrocarbons) but al-
so increase the glacier albedo by deposi-
tion of dust particles directly related to fos-
sil fuel burning.
The effects of transportation on surface
layer of tundra soils was found to be im-
portant even several decades ago (see e.g.
Abele et al. 1984, Buchkina et al. 1998).
The artificial deepening of certain zones
due to deep trails of the vehicles can
change the surface hydrology of the flat
Foxfonna study site. This may have sig-
nificant effect on reshaping the ice wedge
polygons as described in similar condi-
tions by Hinkel et al. (2017). Use of off-
road vehicles has been identified to have
extensive impacts on the landscape also
by Eisner et al. (2008) in Alaska. Land-
scape degradation directly related to tour-
ism activities was identified by several
studies from polar or high-mountainous re-
gions (e.g. Hawes et al. 2006, Tomczyk and
Ewertowski 2011).

Conclusions
It is obvious that with massive increase
of tourism in polar regions, there are in-
evitable consequences for local environ-
ment. These impacts are often concentrated
in few areas, that are widely used by
groups of tourists organized by local travel
agencies. It is the case of both studied lo-
calities – Foxfonna in Svalbard and Lang-
jökull in Iceland. In correspondence with
much higher number of tourists arriving to
Iceland, the effects on terrain disturbances
are more pronounced in the Langjökull
site. New transportation infrastructure has
been developed in last two decades espe-
cially for the purpose of facilitating access
on the ice cap for tourists. The infrastruc-
ture and number of vehicles have direct
impact on the forefield of the ice cap but
also on the glacier surface itself. The nega-
tive effects of off-road transportation are
visible in case of Foxfonna site as well.
These disturbances are, however, present
in much smaller scale and are probably a
result of individual breaking of environ-
mental law restricting in general off-road
activities.
Ásgeirsdóttir and Karlsson (2016) dem-
onstrated that 12.9-17.7% of tourists visit-
ing Iceland has paid for glacier/snowmo-
bile guided tours between 2011 and 2016.
This percentage suggests several tens of
thousands of visitors per year in the Lang-
jökull locality. The high concentration of
tourists to the most famous Icelandic natu-
ral sites have been recognized as the big-
gest problem for natural conservation and
sustainable development of tourist business
by the authorities. Number of actions to
support spatial diversification of visits have
been therefore employed from 2010 (Øian
et al. 2018). The high tourist pressure on
nature has been also identified as the big-
gest problem concerning tourism in the sur-
vey among the local Icelandic population
(Óladóttir 2019). Svalbard is obviously less
visited (see Fig. 1) and proportionally low
number of visits can be expected at the
study site – especially taking into account
the relative difficulty of accessing the lo-
cality. However, the rising trend in visits
persisting for several consecutive years sug-
gests that the pressure is about to rise.
The Arctic tourism as a special branch
of tourism market has emerged during the
last three decades (Viken 2011) and both
regions are a good example of tourism-
oriented economies. As shown by Saarinen
and Varnajot (2019), the demand for “Arc-
tic” experience is still high. On one hand,
Øian et al. (2018) identified the preserved
nature and experience of solitude as an im-
portant reason for visiting the Arctic. On
the other hand, too many tourists concen-
trated on touristic sites can damage this im-
pression and reduce the demand for visit-
ing the Arctic countries in general. There
is a challenge for the future to balance the
sustainable development and nature con-
servation of the Arctic environment with
the high demand and increasing number of
tourists, that may lead to its damage.

Hi Reddit and fellow ice-lovers,
We are Frigga Kruse, Franziska Paul, and Linus Müller-Hillebrand of the Timeless Arctic Project and we are part of the Timeless Arctic Project. Over the course of five years (2018-2023) we are assessing the impact humans had on Svalbard - a formerly pristine environment until it was discovered by European whale hunters.
Also in the team, we have a drone pilot, a scientific illustrator, a nature photographer and filmmaker, a specialist in plastic waste, a psychologist, a bacteriologist, and an archaeologist.
The project is funded by the Volkswagen Foundation as a Freigeist Project since 2018. That basically means that we've got a nice pot of money and can work on a project, which the foundation deemed to be inventive and original. In our case, we want to quantify the human presence and the commercial hunting in the formerly pristine ecosystem of Svalbard.
Frigga is our team leader. She has a PhD in Arctic Archaeology, specilised in Svalbard (which she has visited many times), and this is her project. Svalbard was first documented by Willem Barents in 1596. Soon afterwards, Europeans voyaged to the North to hunt bowhead whales, polar bears, Atlantic walrus, Arctic foxes, and Svalbard reindeer. The populations of these ""Arctic Big Five"" got diminished to the point of almost-extinction. In the 20th century, protective measures were implemented in hopes of recovering the populations. Now Frigga wants to quantify the number of animals killed and study the human-animal-interactions of 420 years of Svalbard history.
Franziska is doing her PhD in Archaeozoology. Her goal is to study the remaining walrus bones left by European hunters. She will count the number of dead animals, quantify the age structure and look for marks on the bones, which will tell her how the animals were killed. This way, she will find out more about hunting techniques of past times.
Linus is the EOC Officer (Education, Outreach, and Communication) and is responsible for PR. Besides working for TA, he is doing a M.Sc. in Environmental Management.
Us three are here today to answer your questions about the Arctic, Svalbard, the project itself, and whatever else comes to your mind.
What do you think of the increasing tourism on Svalbard? I'm surprised at the number of hotels in Longyearbyen.
Linus - I sometimes think about my own interest in going there. I could theoratically do my research locally as well. But I chose Svalbard because... I want to go there? In a way, I'm a tourist as well, but I try to justify it with doing something valuable while I'm there.
How is Svalbard ? I came to know of it first when I read of it in ""His Dark Materials"" and have been fascinated by how isolated it is. Also considering the current pandemic how is the COVID situation there?
Frigga: Yes!, His Dark Materials and that film The Golden Compass instantly home in on Svalbard. I couldn't believe it! Mind, Svalbard in summer is not like the book at all. Svalbard in winter is not far off though, esp. if you sit in a small hunter's cabin in the middle of a snow storm (I have to imagine this; I have not done this myself).
When I am guiding tourists, I tell them to pack like they are going to Scotland in late autumn. The summer whether, during which I do my guiding, is fairly changable but not that extreme. Rain mixed with wind chill is a bummer.
When is the best time of the year to visit Svalbard?
Frigga: Of course that depends on what you go for. If you are interested in Arctic wildlife, I recommend round about end of July: all the newborn are underway then!!! Fox cubs, reindeer calves, chicks of any kind!!!
However, there is also something to be sad for the polar night in Longyearbyen or for when the light comes back and you travel further afield in a snowy, cold but beautiful landscape.
Whatever you do, you will need a guide and polar bear watch. You cannot leave Longyearbyen by yourself.
Hallo :), when did you know you want to become a scientist? Was there a special experience?
Frigga: I really like new knowledge, so I went to university in the first place to get loads and loads of new knowledge in the Bachelor and later in the Master degree. I am quite good at languages, but I did not want to do a language degree because I thought I would only be learning what I already know, just in a new language :/ (Of course, you learn about cultures, etc, too, but such was my thinking back then).
Once at uni, you kind of drift into your research direction :) You have to pick something for your dissertation anyway and eventually you get hooked on something that really interests you :)
Did that give you an idea?
How would you rate a) polar bears and b) puffins on a scale of 1 (kinda boring, will not be looking for those) to 10 (SO EXCITING I WILL BE MAD IF I DO NOT SEE THEM EVERY. SINGLE. DAY. THAT I SPENT IN SVALBARD!!!!)?
Frigga: Polar bears are a 10 for nerve-wrecking! At least if you are on land and then need to evacuate :/ Puffins are a 10 for ""customer satisfaction"" :) They make tourists in general and photographers with large lenses in particular very happy when I am guiding :)
One thing you definitely must not forget to pack for your journey?
Linus - Anti-Sea Rhino Undergarments. You never know.
Can you tell me what roles the other members of your team play for example the archeologist and the bacteriologist ?
Frigga: The most important person is Franzi! The main reason why we are going is so that she can do the fieldwork for her PhD research in archaeozoology. We are aiming to visit some walrus slaughter sites that are know to me. I have been to Svalbard many times since 2008.
Franzi will be supported by myself (knowledgable person ;) and polar bear watch) as well as Matthias Lang. He is a drone pilot: we want to spatially analyse the bones as well to see if we can say something about, for instance different slaughter events or the impact repeated tourism visits had on the assemblage.
I really wanted a filmer and an illustrator on board: Lars Soerink and Jakob Näf, from the Netherlands and Switzerland, respectively.
Since the team was growing and we had ten bunks to fill in any case, I've asked a guiding colleague of mine along as a second polar bear watch: Birgit Lutz. That way we can split the team and a seond group can do other things.
Enter Linus, Marlene, Sean, and Merle. Linus wants to sample different deposits for microplastic. Marlene Jessen wants to do her project on bacteria, basically looking at ""unlikely hosts"" on our archaeological sites to investigate if something new or unexpected will come out of it. She'll look over Sean Desjardin's shoulder as he will be excavting a midden (refuse dump of fromer Russian walrus hunters). And Merle Schmidt? She is doing a project on positive psychology of the group. What do we all bring and what do we all do to make this project a success. And more importantly, how does this inform studies about resilience in our society and what can we tell young people about Arctic research.
I typed a lot. Please ask more specifically whatever you like :)
How do you not get completely depressed about the impacts you see? Hell, just a glance at the news makes me reconsider waking up; I can’t imagine actually diving deep into the bleak details.
Frigga: I genuinely believe the world, this planet is beautiful! Svalbard has so much to offer! And the hunting history is bleak on occasion, but we are seeing that the main game species are recovering from its impact. (Mind, we do not know yet how climate change will affect them.)
I also think human beings are by and large wonderful. We could do more to appreciate the wonders of this world though before losing them.
And lastly, through this project I get a chance to tell the (hi)stories of this amazing part of the world. Science communication and story telling are extremely important. To all generations. Which is why we decided to do today's AMA ;)
Hello! I was wondering what each of your favorite films are?
Franzi: Catch me if you can
Hi, can I ask, what’s the most interesting thing you’ve found in your line of work in Svalbard?
Frigga: A plank of wood! Seriously. I was measuring a building and there was the wooden lid of a box... that came from the dynamite factory of Alfred Nobel! Wow! How long had it been there!
On that note, I also found what looked lile old chewing gum, and that worked out to be small sticks of dynamite. Over 100 years old. I keep them ""in a safe place"" now, so I can show tourist grups when we happen to land in that place...
Would you say this is the coolest thing ever that you can do as a scientist or do you prefer working in the lab? (or is there something else even cooler) (how about writing those funding proposals, Frigga? Sounds fun?)
Linus - There are so many cool things to do as a scientist! But yeah, I'm really happy about this path and it is at least the coolest thing that happened to me (so far ;) ). Lab work is still part of it for me though (but I enjoy that as well).
I seem to get quickly sick at colder regions. What precautionary efforts should I do before travelling to Svalbrad? Thanks in advance!
Frigga: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. I've not heard of anyone complaining about that. Could it be that you are not drinking enough water? I know that the cold represses the need to drink - but we all should keep the water topped up. Also, the air in Svalbard is extremely dry! I never go up north with a ton of moisturiser in my luggage these days. And since I have very short hair, I always, always wear a hat. Do these answers go in the right direction...?
So how much ya'll get paid and what should we do to get a job like yours?
Linus - I'm just a student assistant, so I only work a few hours a month for a little more than German minimum wage. However, my place in upcoming expeditions in paid for. Other people have to pay it themselves and I couldn't afford that on my own. So that's really nice.
I have a BSc in Biology, now I'm doing a MSc in Environmental Management. But as you can read in our OP, we have people from all kinds of backgrounds. I would say the main thing is reaching out and getting into contact with people. Be good at something and apply it to the Arctic environment, whatever that may look like.
Have you listened to The White Vault?
Frigga: I had not heard of it, but now I have saved it. I do like audiobooks and stories, so this will be a treat.
What is the impact of your presence there? Could you not just work remotely?
Frigga: We have a carbon footprint for sure! Flying there, being on board of a ship for three weeks, flying back... but I can as of yet combine it with my conscience.
I did consider if any of it could be done remotely. It is one of the big topics of the Arctic Science Summit Week that is happening just now. But archaeology cannot be done remotely; you really need to be on site. In addition to that, archaeologists and archaeozoologists are highly specialised, so we could not ask the community to do our work for us.
It would maybe be different if we were just doing visual surveys, but this is hands-on archaeology in need of very special fieldwork permits.
It's a good and just question. We think about this all the time.
Sorry to be late to this; there's much I'd like to ask :) Svalbard (probably) landed in the broader consciousness when flooding began to impact the seed vault.
If you're still taking questions: what has been your most jarring finding, and how should the broader population feel about it?
Frigga: I would be happy if the audience to our Timeless Arctic project would stop and think for a while: about whale products past and present, about walrus products, animals furs, soya plantations and plastic. How much do we really need, if any, and how much is just feeding into a luxuary lifestyle?
Where even is Svalbard?
Frigga: hahaha, good one ;) If you draw a line from Norway's North Cape to the North Pole, there's an island group somewhere halfway. That is Svalbard. You may know it better as Spitsbergen.
The name Svalbard pops up in the old sagas and was adopted by Norway for the island group. The name means cold coast (which may refer to a land) or cold edge (which may also refer to the solid edge of the sea ice). So it's an old name for an original place we will never know now used for this island group.
How's the weather over there during Summer?
Frigga: I guess my team and I really found out what the weather is like when we spent a few weeks in summer 2016 in a tent camp! It was alright though. We were dressed for the cold. The average in July/August is around +6 degrees Celsius. The wind chill can be nasty. The worst was the rain. No, I lie, the worst was having to get up out of your sleeping bag in the morning.
Talking of sleeping bags: I do have a woolen hat and a pair of gloves ready, in case it gets too cold. A colleague recommends having a chocolate bar handy: if you wake up cold, you can eat it and it will power the system for a while longer.
I tell people to pack for the changability of a Scottish autumn.
Is the area small enough that you know most people? I first found out about Svalbard from Cecilia Blomdahl on tik tok and Instagram. https://instagram.com/sejsejlija?igshid=sjtiuieqn6cd it looks so beautiful!!
Frigga: I guess if you lived in Longyearbyen, you could place most people after a short while but maybe not known them. There are over 2,000 inhabitants there, and I don't think I even know 2,000 people in total!
I am nowhere near knowing even a handful, and the population keeps changing. I am getting better at knowing summer researchers and summer guides though.
Hey there!
Did any of you read the book about the 4 guys who were stranded there on Svalbard for 4 or 5 years? I'm amazed every time I think of it - which is every time I look at a world map.
Frigga: I did indeed. It wasn't just any guys; they were four Russian walrus hunters and they were not prepared to stay longer than one winter. They managed six years! You have to wonder how. You have to simply marvel!
How much microplastic have you found?
Frigga: I've taken part in several garbage collections on some extremely remote islands. The macro stuff is scarry enough. We haven't looked into the micro part yet; that is a project on the upcoming expedition in August.
As a middle school science teacher, has your team ever considered hosting teacher fellows to help with the research, similar to Teach Earth Fellowships? Teachers could help on the project for a couple of weeks to see what the research is like and find ways to incorporate it into curriculum. For myself, because clearly I'm interested, I teach life science and our last unit is on human-environmental interaction within ecosystems. Being able to help would be super interesting and relevant to what I teach.
Frigga: Do your students know your reddit name ;)
Yes, we have and are considering taking educators on board the expedition, but we unfortunately only have ten bunks. At the moment, there are two educators and a science communicator in our 'ground crew', ready to jump in if one of the core team needs to drop out. We are hoping to make the absolute most of the education, outreach, and communication!
On that note, have you heard about Polar Educators International (PEI). They are have some great resources for teaching polar science in the class room. mind, they are a little thin on archaeology, but my team is working on that.
I have a question for Frigga ! May I know what did you study for your bachelors and masters and how you got into Arctic archeology ?
Frigga: My Bachelor was a joint geology and archaeology degree in Glasgow. My Master was in forensic archaeology in Bournemouth. I once went on a trip to Antarctica and thought the worst of the traces of past human activities there. Little did I know I would one day get hooked on that kind of ""trash""! It wasn't straightforward though. I worked as a geologist in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, where everything is industry, mining, ship-building... without the experience of that amazing cultural heritage, I would never have been attracted to a PhD in mining history and industrial archaeology. It was rather by chance that it happened to be in Svalbard in the Arctic.
These days, I am the Chair of the Polar Archaeology Network. And I teach Arctic archaeology at Kiel in the hope that others find their way into the subject.
How was the experience of visiting the seed vault in Svalbard ?
Frigga: I only ever made it to the front door. To the gangway. Well, to under that gangway. And you would only ever end up under it if you had a friend who was into geo-caching: there used to be a geo-cache there. I don't know what happened to it now that they have totally re-vamped the site and entrance... But me, myself, and I can say that I once sat under the old gangway...
I have, however, been on a tour into the coal mine at Barentsburg. Fully suited and booted. There, they house a film archive. Someone had dropped a slide just outside its door. Well, that poor little slide now never made it into the archive. Any guesses as to what was on that slide?
... the Sphinx!!!
I lived there for a few years and eventhough its breathtakenly beautiful, I've come to the agreement with myself, people shouldn't be living in Svalbard at all! 100%electricity is generated from burning coal and burning trash for heating. They are literally peeing in their own bathtub. Is this your opinion aswell?
Frigga: It is beautiful. Many places in the world are. Luckily, I can look out the window and think that about my own village every day :)
I am not overly negative, and I see some poetic justice in the way we are chosing to treat the planet (I refrain from using 'our' planet) and how it's backfiring on us. And I don't have a bathtub; I think it's a waste of water!
What do you do to amuse yourselves with downtime (if any)? Any good/interesting practical jokes?
Frigga: On expedition, be it research or guiding, there is no such thing as downtime! It's easy to exhaust yourself because you don't want to miss a thing! So you mostly catch up on sleep, whever the chance arises. Or you are glued to your binoculars, trying to spot wildlife. I do bring a book, and I usually get to read it, too. It's important to tune out on occasion. Also, you are always around people! As much as I like my colleagues and crew, sometimes you go to your bunk just to be alone...
Can I visit Svalbard? In the winter? How do I go about it?
Frigga: Thanks for chipping in, folks. So, yes, it is actually fairly easy to fly to Longyearbyen (in non-corona times), but it is not that easy to get around without a bear watch paid for the task. Svalbard is usually a very expensive trip, even if you manage to stay at the campsite and only eat the specials from the supermarket. It needs to be planned very well; don't just go on a whim.
Are there any provisions of the Svalbard Treaty you feel are outdated or need to be revised/updated?
Edit - Feel like adding an Arctic lawyer to your team? Environmental regs in Svalbard are pretty extensive, especially regarding archeology.
Frigga: My PhD thesis treats British mining at the time when Spitsbergen was still a no man's land and the company's tried to get the island group incorporated into the British Empire. Interesting stuff (even if I say so myself!)
The Treaty (signed 1920, ratified 1925) only really treats the land and not the sea. It never foresaw this increase in tourism, and international science and scientific collaboration is badly covered, esp. when it comes to accessing and working in protected areas. But generally, those involved in the fieldwork application and permission process are doing what they can.
I lead a research group in Arctic historical ecology in Kiel. I'd welcome all, if I could. Funds are the limiting factor, but maybe you have a cracking idea...
Would you rather fight one polar bear-sized puffin or thirty puffin-sized polar bears?
Follow up: How many puffin-sized polar bears do you realistically think you could fend off for several hours and what's your reasoning?
Frigga: Just for a laugh, I just looked up the list of unusual measurement units on Wikipedia. Your units are not listed, and my scientific brain cannot cope. However, if we convert centipawn (whatever that is...) to centipaw, we could maybe work out how many times I would need to be pawed by either before I go down.
Oh, I just don't know. Death by puffin might be quick. Death by tiny polar bear might be like piranhas... I go for puffin!
What is the biggest impact on Svalbard from humans? And is there anything imported to the area that makes it worse?
Frigga: I think the biggest impact was having been put on the map by Willem Barents in 1596 in the first place!
But imagine, even if the island group had not been reached by people yet, it would be experiencing climate change and global population! Woah, that's mind-boggling!
You'd have to define what you think is ""bad"" human impact. There have been biological and technological introductions, the latter making human habitation possible. I bet none of the Arctoc foxes are too happy about getting rabies from time to time...
A meteorologist can't accurately predict the weather from day to day so what makes you think that humans legitimately are causing climate change? and not just an earth cycle.
Frigga: Meteorologists are pretty good at what they do; how accurate do you need the weather report to be? As for human-induced climate change: using the generally accepted scientific method, all data points that way. But whether one believes the scientific data or not, the question is in any case what we all can do to alleviate the negative trends we are, all of us, witnessing in the world today.
Longyearbyen is a gem. I've been fortunate enough to visit it 3 times before...and heading back there again next month.
@Franziska, are you focussing on the historical numbers and human-impacts for Jan Mayen as well? I believe the last bear was shot there in the 80s...and the fauna is now limited to birds and 2 huskies (Storm & Kuling).
Franzi - Hey, sorry for my late reply. As Frigga already said, I am solely focusing on the human related changes in animal populations in Svalbard. However, Jan Mayen sounds like a very interesting area for such examinations.
Hello! I was wondering what each of your favorite films are?
Frigga: That was the first question we got on this AMA! Is there a trick behind it? In any case, I have more than one favourite film, so I'll name The Last Unicorn here.
When are you starting your band?
Frigga: As soon as I no longer find my Arctic research rewarding. I guess by then I'll be covering ""oldies"" from back in 2021 ;)
Thoughts on climate change?
Frigga: The planet's climate has always been changing. We are actually at the end of the last ice age. There is much scientific data to suggest though that humans have accelerated the process beyond predictability. We've tipped the points.
How do you cope with environmental grief?
Frigga: By accepting that human beings are not perfect. We seem to be setting on finding out which way the dinosaurs went! Only we seem to be going that way knowingly and willingly.
How timeless?
Frigga: Legit! So timeless is a play on words. Many people perceive the Arctic in general as timeless; we used to use phrases like eternal ice - but, well, I guess no one who has any idea about the state the planet is in uses that anymore :/
Timless also suggests that we simply do not have much well-dated data yet to really differetiated hunting practices and their immediate and lasting effects.
We are thinking of keeping the timeless part and then just adding other regions of the Arctic as we expend our research :)
iirc you’re required to have a gun when visiting svalbard, so doesnt that mean you have to be 18 AND you have to complete a norwegian gun test? if so wouldnt it be easier to move to america and THEN go to svalbard?
Frigga: Check out what the Governor says about this on sysselmannen.no
How do you not get completely depressed about the impacts you see? Hell, just a glance at the news makes me reconsider waking up; I can’t imagine actually diving deep into the bleak details.
Frigga: The big picture can be very overwhelming. I recommened to people to also look at the small, good things that happen in their communities. And if they are not happening already, get involved in initiatives that put quality back into your life.
How much radiation had America hid in Greenland and how soon will it affect the arctic?
Frigga: That is a question I cannot answer. I don't know. There are varying amounts of radiation distributed all over the planet, incl. the Arctic. The assessment programmes I know of seem to be focussing on mercury just now. But I waffle; I don't know. . ",False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False
maritime-executive,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/norway-moves-to-ban-carriage-of-hfo-in-waters-near-svalbard ,"Norway Moves to Ban Carriage of HFO in Waters Near Svalbard
The government of Norway has proposed to ban the use or carriage of heavy fuel oil in waters off Svalbard, extending a prohibition that currently applies to a limited number of protected areas in the archipelago.
""Svalbard has a very vulnerable environment and large, distinctive wilderness areas. Therefore, the government has set high environmental goals for Svalbard, which means that the risk of damage to the environment must be low. A ban on heavy oil that applies to the whole of Svalbard is a natural step to take to reduce this risk,"" said Minister of Climate and Environment Sveinung Rotevatn in a statement.
The regulation would require vessels to bunker with marine gas oil or diesel prior to transiting Svalbard's waters (and encourages a transition to ""green"" alternatives). Lighter fuels like MGO dissipate more quickly in the marine environment, unlike HFO, which can linger for years in the Arctic cold. HFO carries a particular risk for ice-bound regions: no definitive response technique has yet been found to clean up a heavy fuel oil or crude oil spill in ice.
The prohibition will primarily affect large cruise ships and the cargo ships that carry supplies to and from the port of Longyearbyen. The Ministry of Climate and Environment noted that fuel costs will rise for the vessel operators, but the clean-up costs and economic costs in the event of a spill will be reduced. The proposal includes a two-year transition period for merchant vessel traffic to Longyearbyen and Barentsburg, and this will be reassessed after a period of consultation.
At present, an HFO carriage ban is in effect for Nordvest-Spitsbergen National Park, Forlandet National Park and Sør-Spitsbergen National Park, along with the Nordaust-Svalbard Nature Reserve and Søraust-Svalbard Nature Reserve. The ministry said that it seeks to expand the ban because these areas could still be damaged if an HFO fuel spill occurred outside of their boundaries.
The Clean Arctic Alliance, an NGO which advocates for an HFO ban throughout the Arctic, welcomed the Norwegian government's announcement and called on other nations to follow suit.
""Norway leads the way amongst Arctic nations in getting rid of HFO from Arctic waters, and is demonstrating international leadership by going above and beyond the weak ambitions of Arctic HFO ban currently being considered by the International Maritime Organization,” said Clean Arctic Alliance lead advisor Dr. Sian Prior in a statement.
The IMO has drafted an Arctic HFO regulation, but the International Council on Clean Transportation assesses that its text will have a limited effect on shipping, with a large majority of Arctic HFO users permitted to continue operations unhindered through the 2020s. .

The Norwegian government has given the go-ahead to a new coal mine in Svalbard, a high-arctic archipelago off the northern coast of Norway, despite clear objections from WWF and an acknowledgement from all Norway’s political parties that climate change is greatest challenge of our time.
The Norwegian government has given the go-ahead to a new coal mine in Svalbard, a high-arctic archipelago off the northern coast of Norway, despite clear objections from WWF and an acknowledgement from all Norway’s political parties that climate change is greatest challenge of our time.
""The climate change issue is not determined by yes or no to a new coal mine on Svalbard, but the sum of what all countries are doing. This coal mine is completely unnecessary, and a prosperous country like Norway should have set a good example"", says Rasmus Hansson, Secretary-General of WWF-Norway.
WWF believes the project is the world's most unnecessary coal mine, and is asking the government present a plan for Svalbard to be a renewable society .
Words don't match actions
Norway's Labour Party acknowledges in its platform that ""climate challenges must be met in all areas of society, locally, nationally and internationally"", and that phasing out coal is key to addressing globally rising greenhouse gas emissions. The decision to approve new coal mining, then, shows a tremendous disconnect between words and action. ""Now is the time for the Labour party to put forward a phase-out plan as part of the upcoming government white paper on climate change"", says Hansson. “The government must also present a plan for Svalbard, the high-arctic climate change showcase of the world, to become a society powered by renewable energy.”
Ten percent of Norway's emissions
The planned mine in Svalbard will produce 1.9 million tonnes of coal per year, creating 5.5 million tonnes of new CO2 emissions per year when it is burned in power plants -- equivalent to ten percent of Norway's total emissions per year. After a start up phase of 2 years, the mine will be fully operational for 4-5 years , and will be exhausted by 2020.
The main argument for further coal mining in Svalbard is to ensure settlement and Norwegian sovereignty on the archipelago. It is estimated that the mine will provide up to 400 jobs.
Coal is one of the most environmentally damaging forms of energy, and according to the International Energy Agency, accounts for half the rise in energy consumption in the past decade. There is widespread agreement that global coal production needs to decline and move to other energy sources in order to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions and accelerating global warming. .

By Alexandra Brzozowski
(EurActiv) — The Norwegian government has announced plans to ban heavy fuel oil (HFO), a dirty marine fuel that propels most vessels, around its Svalbard archipelago in the Arctic Ocean. The effort comes as UN efforts have been deemed too slow.
Norway on Friday (6 November) proposed to completely ban the use of heavy fuel oil (HFO) by shipping around the Arctic archipelago of Svalbard.
“A spill of heavy oil will be catastrophic for nature and the environment. But it will also have an impact on the reputation of tourism in Svalbard. Therefore, we must do everything we can to prevent the unthinkable,” Norway’s Minister of Climate and Environment, Sveinung Rotevatn, told NRK about the plans.
According to the minister, a spill around Svalbard could lead to major damage, because heavy oil is difficult to handle amid low temperatures and ice.
In addition, the work of cleaning up would be both costly and complicated in the event of a spill. This is because of large distances, difficult weather, and scarcity of response capabilities in the area.
“Svalbard has very vulnerable nature and large distinctive wilderness areas. Therefore, the government has set high environmental targets for Svalbard, which means that the risk of damage to the environment must be low. A ban on heavy oil that applies to the whole of Svalbard is a natural step to take to reduce this risk,” Rotevatn said in a press release.
At present, there is already a partial heavy oil ban in protected areas around Svalbard in place which only allows sailing if the ship runs on diesel or other more environmentally friendly fuels.
Over the last few years, the number of cruise ships with several thousand passengers visiting the archipelago’s main town Longyearbyen has drastically increased.
HFO has been banned from Svalbard’s national park waters since 2015, and has been banned in Antarctic waters since 2011.
So far, no date for the start of the ban has been set as the proposal for the new regulation is meant to go through a public hearing in parliament.
The push by the government wants this to apply to the entire archipelago.
The Norwegian announcement also comes at a time as researchers rate a proposal to curb ship pollution in the Arctic, weakened to suit Russian interests, would delay meaningful action until the end of the decade.
In February 2020, the IMO and its member states developed a draft regulation prohibiting the use and carriage as fuel of heavy fuel oil by ships in the Arctic.
Under draft plans being negotiated at the International Maritime Organisation (IMO), the UN body responsible for international shipping, restrictions on heavy fuel oil would only come into effect in July 2024.
But a host of exemptions would allow most ships using and carrying HFO to continue to pollute Arctic waters until 2029.
A recent study, published in September by the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT), estimated that if the draft ban had been in place in 2019, around three-quarters of the fleet using HFO would have still been allowed in the Arctic.
According to the findings, the regulation will only reduce the use of HFOs by 16% and the carriage of HFO as a fuel by 30% when it takes effect in July 2024. Overall, it will allow 74% of Arctic shipping to continue with business as usual, the ICCT said.
As the Arctic fleet grows, so will the number of ships that qualify for an exemption, “and the effectiveness of the ban would be further eroded,” the researchers warned.
Reacting to the announcement by the Norwegian government, the Clean Arctic Alliance, an international pressure group, welcomed the “important commitment” taken by Norway. The alliance calls on IMO member states to agree a stronger ban on HFOs in the Arctic region ahead of its November meeting.
“If the IMO’s Arctic HFO ban is approved as currently drafted, it will expose the Arctic to even greater risks associated with HFO throughout the 2020s,” warned Sian Prior, lead advisor at the Clean Arctic Alliance.
“Norway’s commitment to protect the waters and environment of Svalbard must serve as the impetus for greater ambition from Arctic states to agree to a stronger and effective ban on this dirty shipping fuel throughout the Arctic,” Prior said. .

Preventing damage to the environment has become a way of life for many people, with zero waste, sustainable living and carbon footprint reduction becoming common goals in households and businesses across the nation. Selecting even a few actions from the vast array of options for greening the planet to incorporate into daily activities can protect water resources, improve air quality, reduce waste and raise awareness of environmental issues.
Conserve Water
With 36 states in the U.S. potentially facing water shortages in 2013, water conservation is a critical environmental concern (See References 1). Conserving water not only extends our water resources for use by future generations, it protects the animals and plants that live in areas with limited water availability. Easy ways to conserve water include installing low-flow fixtures in bathrooms and kitchens, planting a native garden instead of a lawn in your yard, taking short showers and fixing leaks immediately (See References 2).
Clear the Air
Despite significant improvements in air quality since 1990, approximately 124 million people in the U.S. lived in counties that exceeded one or more national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS) in 2010 (See References 4). Taking action to improve air quality runs the gamut from planting trees to filter the air to purchasing green energy for residential use and using ride-sharing, public, pedal or pedestrian transport to reduce trips and vehicle emissions (See References 4).
Reduce Waste
In 2010 Americans generated garbage at a rate of 4.43 pounds per person per day and recycled garbage at a rate of only 34 percent, leaving 165 million tons of trash destined for landfills (See References 5), according to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency statistics. Reducing waste in combination with recycling can reduce methane emissions, save energy and increase forest carbon sequestration (See References 6). Waste reduction actions include reusing and buying used or recycled items, choosing items in less packaging and purchasing fewer items that could end up in a landfill (See References 7, Waste).
Bonus Action: Become an Advocate for the Planet
Becoming an advocate for the environment can extend individual actions to a much larger group, creating a positive impact on protecting the planet. Talking to others about the state of the environment locally and globally raises awareness and increases the likelihood of action (See References 7). Steps to consider include participating in a local environmental event, starting a recycling competition at work or sharing a commitment for the environment on social networking sites (See References 7).

Environmentalists are concerned about the fragile Arctic ecosystem, and campaigners worry relations with Russia will deteriorate as Norway pushes the limits of the Svalbard treaty.
The Svalbard archipelago is northwest of Norway, east of Greenland and south of the North Pole. In addition to the 2,667 people who lived in Svalbard as of 2016, polar bears, Svalbard reindeer and Arctic foxes make their home in the remote and rugged terrain. Svalbard is one of the northernmost inhabited areas of the world.

“Irrespective of changes in the environment, the Arctic is a very harsh place,” said Ilan Kelman, a professor at UCL and Agder University in Norway. “A lot can go wrong, and when something goes wrong … it can cause extensive damage for a long time.”
Several environmental groups, including WWF, Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth Norway, sent an open letter to the Norwegian government pointing out its long track record of ignoring the wisdom of environmentalists to not continue a decades-long northward expansion of oil exploration. “Given that we don’t yet have the technology to clean up spills in an Arctic environment, it really doesn’t make any sense to continue with offshore extraction there,” Kelman said of the Svalbard move.
Two of the reasons that this oil expansion is so tricky are the Svalbard treaty and the definition of the “ice edge.” Originally called the Spitsbergen Treaty, eight countries signed it in Paris in 1920 to try to regulate administrative and economic activities in an area that has been compared to the Wild West. Now, 46 countries are involved. The treaty states that Norway governs Svalbard legally and administratively, but that citizens from all treaty signatory nations can access Svalbard for economic activities. No nation, including Norway, is allowed to permanently station its military on the archipelago. Some experts are worried that Norway’s petroleum development in Svalbard will cause tension with other countries, especially Russia.
Then there’s the ice edge, that place where open seas meet ice. This area is important because it’s where marine mammals, fish and birds feed on plankton. Because it’s so ecologically sensitive, the ice edge has been a no-fly zone for petroleum activities. But Norway has continually nudged its definition of the ice edge north to accommodate oil extraction. This latest move to open parts of Svalbard to petroleum companies is the farthest push north yet.

thenation,https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/svalbard-arctic-open-borders/ ,"Svalbard, Norway
When you land in Longyearbyen, the largest settlement in the Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard, you can step off the plane and just walk away. There’s no passport control, no armed guard retracing your steps, no biometric machine scanning your fingers. Svalbard is as close as you can get to a place with open borders: As long as you can support yourself, you can live there visa-free.
That doesn’t make Svalbard an egalitarian place—far from it. All commercial flights currently go through Oslo or Tromsø, so travelers must obtain transit visas and wait in lines there instead. Svalbard provides minimal social services, so it won’t attract the world’s tired, poor, and weary. When in 2015 a right-wing Norwegian politician offered to send refugee families north rather than accommodate them on the mainland, it was not meant as a kindness.
Still, there is something utopian about a place where almost anyone could live. Amid scaremongering about unrestricted migration, I went to Svalbard because I wanted to see whether there were lessons we could learn from this 2,300-person community a few hundred miles south of the North Pole.
What I discovered was a historical accident, rooted in environmental determinism and shaped by economics, that is being irreversibly upended. There’s a dismal symmetry at play: As climate change renders the rest of the planet as hostile to human life as the far north, we too must make the choice between throwing up walls and letting them down. Svalbard’s geopolitics provide an imperfect but alternative vision of how places can be governed, whom they can accommodate, and how communities can form.
Formally, Svalbard—known as Spitsbergen until the 20th century—belongs to Norway, which writes the laws, enforces order, builds infrastructure, and regulates hunting, fishing, and housing. Last year, when a Russian man was caught trying to rob a bank in town, a Norwegian judge sentenced him under Norwegian law to a Norwegian jail. But Norway’s control over Svalbard comes with obligations outlined by an unusual 1920 treaty signed as part of the Versailles negotiations ending World War I.
Written in the aftermath of the war, the Svalbard Treaty is both of and ahead of its time. Its architects stipulated that the territory cannot be used for “warlike” purposes. They included one of the world’s first international conservation agreements, making Norway responsible for the preservation of the surrounding natural environment. The treaty also insists that the state must not tax its citizens more than the minimum needed to keep Svalbard running, which today typically amounts to an 8 percent income tax, well below mainland Norway’s roughly 40 percent.
Most radically, the treaty’s architects held Norway to what’s known as the nondiscrimination principle, which prevents the state from treating non-Norwegians differently from Norwegians. This applies not just to immigration but also to opening businesses, hunting, fishing, and other commercial activities. Other countries could not lay formal claims on Svalbard, but their people and companies would be at no disadvantage.
That freedom might be a function of how logistically difficult life here can be. In June Svalbard’s weather compares to January in New York City. But the winter brings three months of night, when temperatures can dip below –40 degrees—where Fahrenheit meets Celsius. In mid-February, the days start to lengthen, and by mid-April, the midnight sun makes a mockery of the body’s circadian rhythms. Come August, the sun’s transit shortens once more, and the cycle repeats.
You can tell a lot about a city by its arrivals terminal. Geneva, where I grew up, is full of ads for expensive watches and wealth management firms. New York’s John F. Kennedy Airport assaults you with opportunities for commerce and consumption—Starbucks, taxis, currency exchange. In Longyearbyen the terminal is about the size of a school gym. There are posters for the local research university, a logistics and shipping company named Pole Position, and satellite operators whose white orbs dot a nearby mountaintop. Because of its northern latitude, Svalbard is ideally located to pick up communications from polar-orbiting satellites and houses the world’s largest commercial ground station.
The terminal’s most prominent signs, however, are aimed at the growing number of tourists—walrus safaris, trips to see the Northern Lights, and shops, restaurants, and bars. In the middle of the baggage claim belt stands a taxidermied polar bear with Svalbard’s most famous bylaws displayed by its side: To leave Longyearbyen, you must respect nature, notify the government, and carry a gun. These days, travelers from around the world go to Svalbard for what has become known as last-chance tourism: The desire to see polar bears, glaciers, and icebergs before they disappear.
Svalbard never had an indigenous population, and seafaring Vikings may have spotted it around 1200. But Willem Barentsz, a Dutch explorer, is credited with the discovery in 1596 during his expedition to find the Northeast Passage to China at a time when maritime embargoes blocked Dutch ships from much of Southern Europe. A decade later, on one of his trips in search of the Northwest Passage, Henry Hudson noticed pods of whales swimming off the archipelago’s coast, helping to spur the development of a whaling industry.
As foreigners clamored for whales and territory, Spitsbergen’s wildlife suffered. At the end of the 17th century, the Dutch fleet alone killed 750 to 1,250 whales a year. By the 1870s, overexploitation had taken its toll. In a recent book, the legal scholar Christopher Rossi describes the remains of butchered whales lining the coasts even as the industry declined: “Denuded of its cetological economy, human interest in Spitsbergen was swept away, along with the detritus left by flensers at the water’s edge.” Those slaughtered whales are said to haunt Svalbard’s bays and beaches to this day.
In the late 19th century, Sweden and Norway—at the time one nation—tried to claim sovereignty over the archipelago. But Russia, then a monarchy, objected. Through an exchange of diplomatic notes, Russia and Sweden-Norway reached a compromise, declaring Spitsbergen terra nullius: It “could not be the object of exclusive possession by any State.” So until the 1919 Paris Peace Conference, Svalbard was officially a no man’s land, arguably the world’s last.
This, unsurprisingly, led to conflict. At the turn of the 20th century, prospectors found coal buried deep below Svalbard’s ice, and coal production and export became the archipelago’s main industry. Companies competed against one another for land, resources, and labor in an essentially lawless environment. When workers went on strike, no one knew whom to appeal to. At one ill-fated mine operation named Advent City, English managers tried to petition the Royal Navy to intervene in the unrest. Later, disgruntled Norwegian miners complained to their government about how an American company was treating them, objecting in particular to the food. In neither case did the governments do much to help.
Among Svalbard’s most prominent personalities was an American businessman and coal entrepreneur named John Munro Longyear, who cofounded the Arctic Coal Company in 1906. It established a company town called Longyear City—now Longyearbyen. He fancied himself a kind of polar emperor, bragging about being the “King of Spitsbergen.” The more money he poured into his creaky mines, the more entitled he felt to political control.
Longyear was shameless. He lobbied the US State Department to expand the Guano Islands Act, which allowed US citizens to take possession of uninhabited islands caked in bird feces, to apply to coal as well. When that didn’t pan out, he tried to preempt a 1911 conference on the future of Svalbard’s governance by proposing that the region be run by a private corporation, registered in the US or Britain and capitalized with a combined $10 million from interested countries; naturally, he, his business partners, and their Arctic Coal Company would control a combined one-third of the stock.
Under his plan, the territory would remain open to all nationalities, and the corporation would oversee government functions like regulating hunting and fishing, managing prisons, administering land and real estate, and limiting the sale of booze (to deter the miners from getting drunk, which the coal boss resented). Longyear’s contact at the State Department was not impressed, pointing out that should shareholders opt to liquidate their assets, another country could seize control. Also, the company could purchase a majority of the shares, turning Svalbard into a corporate dictatorship overnight.
Norway, meanwhile, was inching closer to staking its own claim. It built the first telegraph station in Svalbard in 1911, establishing control over crucial telecommunications infrastructure; two years later, a papal decree combined the archipelago “with the Apostolic vicarate of Norway,” suggesting an entitlement of a more divine provenance.
Conferences came and went without a decision on what to do with Spitsbergen. Then war broke out across Europe. Exhausted by his efforts, Longyear sold his holdings in 1916 to a Norwegian company, Store Norske Spitsbergen, which continues to operate a mine on the archipelago.
Svalbard remained ungoverned until the Paris Peace Conference, when the Allies accepted Norway’s sovereignty, in part as a reward for its wartime support. Even the neighboring USSR agreed to the deal. The Bolsheviks were apparently so desperate to establish their own sovereign legitimacy that they ceded the land in exchange for diplomatic recognition from Norway. The treaty went into effect in 1925, and 46 countries have signed—notably North Korea in 2016.
I remember the moment I realized I needed to visit Svalbard. A college friend and his partner were visiting from Boston, and after listening to me complain about my difficulties in applying for a US green card—the interminable paperwork, the agonizing delays, the black box of US Citizenship and Immigration Services, and most of all, the feeling of not quite belonging in the place I have called home since I turned 18—my friend asked if I’d heard of Svalbard. His partner joked that I should consider relocating. “I have a high school friend who moved there for good,” he said. “My sister went last year, and she had a great time.”
I had heard of Svalbard, but it never fully registered as a real place where people actually lived. I’d read Wikipedia, skimmed an academic paper or two, and glossed over a couple of articles about a doomsday vault that holds specimens of nearly a million seed varieties. I’d assumed it would be like Werner Herzog’s portrayal of Antarctica in Encounters at the End of the World: governed by an international treaty system but monotonous, closed off, and full of scientists.
I’d also never thought of myself as a polar kind of person. They seemed to me to be a different sort of animal—ruddy, straightforward, strong of nerve, and keen to endure physical challenges. Australian, perhaps, and on the taller side. Definitely blond.
I—small, dark, often anxious, and usually cold—have few polar qualities. But I was restless for adventure, and when my green card finally arrived, I applied for an art residency to sail around Svalbard for two weeks. We departed from Longyearbyen, which was nothing like what I expected. The town, perhaps obviously, has lots of normal towny things: roads, a veterinarian, a supermarket, and museums. Its center is a small strip of shops and colorful prefabricated buildings. Longyearbyen was unremarkable—ugly, even—save for the dramatic backdrop of mountains with names like Sukkertoppen, Gruvfjellet, and Trollsteinen.
Evidence of Svalbard’s open border policy is subtle. There are people of 53 nationalities living here, including a significant Thai and Filipino population and a number of younger backpacking types (seemingly all polar) from around the world who show up mainly to work in the tourism industry. According to Svalbard’s governor, 37 percent of Longyearbyen’s population is foreign.
The leader of our traveling expedition—let’s call her Anna—was the platonic ideal of a polar person. Blond and agile, with sun-seared cheeks and eyes blue as glacier ice, she spends much of her time on ships, passing the northern summer months in the Arctic and the southern summer in Antarctica—a migratory pattern comparable to that of the Arctic tern, a bird that traverses the globe to chase the sun. Our ship was the Antigua, and it was where we slept, worked, and ate. Mealtimes, regular to the point of being military, kept us on a schedule in the endless daylight. We quickly learned that the experience of visiting the Arctic depends overwhelmingly on the season, the weather, and the thickness and thaw of the ice, which can immobilize waters for months at a time.
Far from a frigid monochrome, the landscape can be varied and full of life. Our first stop was Gnålodden, a landing spot in Hornsund, a fjord where we anchored after a queasy day at sea. A Zodiac took us to shore at the foot of a mossy mountain where small white gulls called kittiwakes chattered over waterfalls and crackling ice. There was no discernible smell other than an occasional whiff of loam. The ground under my hiking shoes felt damp and squishy, with snowmelt trickling its way through rocks and clusters of purple flowers.
Back at sea, we were well within Svalbard’s territorial waters and subject to the 1920 treaty. But beyond 12 nautical miles from the coasts, governments don’t all agree on how Norwegian—or not—the waters are. Maritime regulations can be complex, but disagreements, not unlike those over the US Constitution, are essentially over whether the Svalbard Treaty is a living document. The Norwegians contend that any area not explicitly mentioned in the treaty defaults to ordinary Norwegian sovereignty. Critics like Russia and Spain say the spirit of the treaty, namely the nondiscrimination principle, should prevail.
The reason this is more than an abstract dispute is that in 1969, Norway discovered oil in the North Sea. More recently, snow crabs, escaping warming waters, migrated north, bringing renewed attention to the Svalbard Treaty. In January 2017 the Norwegian Coast Guard held a Latvian trawler, the Senator, in Svalbard’s port for setting out 2,600 crab traps. The ship claimed to have a permit from the European Union, but Norway insisted that only it could hand out licenses; the case made it to the Norwegian Supreme Court, where all 11 of the judges ruled against the trawler.
The case wasn’t just about shellfish, though. Snow crabs are sedentary species, unlikely to move far during their short lives. That means they’re regulated not like fish but like minerals. Snow crabs were a proxy for oil. The crab case is settled for now, but the underlying conflict over jurisdiction is unlikely to stay dormant for long.
Svalbard has always been a place for superlatives. It was the site of the northernmost battle of World War II, after which much of its population was evacuated. Today, Svalbard boasts the world’s northernmost pub, northernmost wine cellar, northernmost alternative weekly newspaper, and northernmost jazz festival. A performance artist once traveled here to make the world’s northernmost piece of toast—a metaphor for climate change, or late capitalism, or something.
Svalbard is also home to the northernmost statue of Vladimir Lenin: a symbol of faded Soviet ambitions as well as the nondiscrimination principle at work. Norway owns all the land in Svalbard, except for the settlements belonging to a state-owned Russian coal company, Arktikugol. The treaty granted the Soviet Union (and now Russia) the right to maintain a commercial presence on the archipelago as long as it abided by Norwegian law; because the USSR could not go in as a state, it asserted itself with industry instead.
One Arktikugol company town, Barentsburg, was founded by the Dutch and sold to the USSR in 1932, destroyed by the Nazis in 1943, then rebuilt in the 1970s. Today it has a population of roughly 450 and a sputtering mining industry. Barentsburg is just 35 miles from Longyearbyen but is accessible only by boat, snowmobile, or helicopter. In 2014, The New York Times described it as “grim,” and a decade earlier, a Norwegian court sentenced a murderer to just four years in prison, reasoning that conditions here provided “mitigating circumstances in favor of the convict.” We did not visit Barentsburg.
Pyramiden, on the other hand, has none of these problems: It has been practically a ghost town since 1998. We arrived there about 12 days into our voyage, and it was the first sign of human life we’d seen since departing on the Antigua, save for some run-down trapper cabins, one of which had been destroyed by a polar bear. When I stepped onto the decrepit pier, a rotting wood plank collapsed, nearly claiming my ankle. In the distance, coal tunnels raised above the permafrost snaked their way up the peak for which the town is named, passing by the words “Miri Mir” (Peace on Earth) painted in white Cyrillic letters on the side of the mountain.
Today, Pyramiden—or Pyramida, as the Russians call it—has only a half-dozen residents, but for decades it was a thriving Soviet town. Between the crumbling remnants of its mining infrastructure, the classic Soviet architecture, and some surprisingly resilient monuments (including Lenin), you can see clues as to how it prospered. Unlike other settlements on the archipelago, Pyramiden boasts grassy lawns, with soil the Soviet government shipped in from the mainland. The town has an old greenhouse where tomatoes, cucumbers, and greens grew; a barn for imported livestock; a playground; and workers’ dorms, where iceboxes still sit on windowsills.
Over the years, mismanagement and dwindling coal reserves—not to mention the fall of the USSR—caused residents to trickle out. Then a Svalbard Airport plane crash in 1996 killed more than 100 residents, pushing more to move away. Most didn’t bother to take their belongings, so it looked as if the people of Pyramiden had just evaporated, leaving their furniture, clothes, books, and tools behind. The most unsettling thing about Pyramiden today is the massive colony of kittiwakes that have taken up residence in the ruins and shriek at all hours as they build nests and feed their young.
Under their din, the town may be experiencing the beginnings of a revival. Wandering around the nearly abandoned Soviet recreation center, complete with a basketball court, a movie theater, and music rooms with untuned pianos, broken drum kits, and Russian sheet music for songs from Paul McCartney’s band Wings, I ran into four young men in skullcaps. I asked them in Russian how they got here; they replied that they were builders from Tajikistan who arrived on a charter flight from Moscow that flies every few months (thus avoiding Norwegian transit visa requirements). They were hired to restore a few of the buildings; it’s lonely, one of them said.
The builders live alongside a small group of entrepreneurial Russian hipsters who lead tours trying to capitalize on Pyramiden’s Soviet kitsch and spooky ghost town appeal. There is a hotel, Tulpan (Tulip), with a bar that serves negronis (yes, the world’s northernmost) and vodkas infused with local cowberry, ginger, and horseradish while screening black-and-white footage of the town from decades past. It’s easy to picture boatloads of tourists filling Pyramiden, or at least this bar, ready to let loose, as we were, after long days at sea. It’s hard not to resent them in advance for ruining something so perfectly ruined.
The problem of overtourism in Svalbard is hardly confined to Pyramiden: During the summer months, cruise ship passengers descend upon Longyearbyen, sometimes doubling the town’s population in a matter of hours. It seems everyone in the town—tour guides, shopkeepers, entrepreneurs, the governor—agree that the archipelago’s infrastructure cannot handle this many bodies. Longyearbyen still runs on coal, has no septic system, and ships most of its trash back to the mainland. But regulating these arrivals is contentious and brings up bigger issues of governance, regulation, and economics.
Tourism, like whaling and coal before it, is a lucrative industry that can’t continue growing indefinitely. Only this time, instead of frontiersmen acting largely alone, decision-making happens by a great many people. Svalbard might appear to be a libertarian fantasy of open borders, self-sufficiency, and low taxes, but managing such a society requires a surprising amount of government.
The highest authority on the islands is the sysselmann, or governor, of Svalbard, who is appointed by the central government in Oslo. The job—a combination of police chief, spokesperson, and consul general—is a bit like being a sheriff in the Wild West. “I never thought I’d have to learn to use a rifle and a satellite phone for my job,” the current governor, Kjerstin Askholt, told me as we walked down the halls of her office (per local tradition dating to coal-mining days, I took off my shoes upon entering and thus conducted the interview in Hawaiian print socks).
She said her office manages search and rescue operations, arrests drunken drivers and snowmobilers, and occasionally officiates marriages. She also expels people to the mainland three or four times a year if they are homeless, ill, or broke. “This is not a cradle to grave society,” one of Askholt’s colleagues told me.
In Longyearbyen, there’s also a democratically elected mayor and community council, which oversees the school, roads, waste management, and other town affairs. Residents can vote if they’ve lived in town for at least three years, though, oddly, Nordic citizens—not just Norwegians—can vote after only a few weeks. (The Svalbard Treaty’s nondiscrimination clause does not mention democratic representation.)
Askholt said the governor’s office is working with the council as well as with tourism companies to make recommendations to Oslo on how to manage the crush of arrivals, but the final decision gets made on the mainland. Her immediate concern is that there is little regulation about who can lead tours. “A few years ago, six Saudi tourists hired a guide who took them out with a weapon but no real license,” she recalled. “They thought they saw a polar bear, but because the guide wasn’t certified, he tossed the weapon, left, and told them all to run for their lives.”
She added, “We found six very cold Saudi tourists a few hours later. This is the sort of thing that needs to stop.”
Askholt did not criticize Svalbard’s diversity, but she did note, referring to a government white paper, that making sure Norwegians aren’t outnumbered here is a national priority. Norway appears to want to avoid ruling over a community made up mostly of nonnationals. “What matters the most to us is to protect the wilderness and maintain the Norwegian community in Svalbard,” she said.
In a place with open borders, crafting incentives is complex: If you make life on Svalbard appealing—with good schools, for instance, or better housing—there’s no way to guarantee that it will be Norwegians who come. At the same time, Svalbard cannot turn away anyone on account of nationality. The result, which can be easily justified with the treaty’s mandate of low taxes, is that the Norwegian government provides as little as possible: Unlike the mainland, the islands have minimal health care, child care, and housing benefits.
And that, in turn, shapes Svalbard’s spirit—for better or for worse. “A lot of people are coming here with different kinds of dreams and visions, and it’s not always a success for them,” Askholt said. “When you can come from so many countries, to come up at all says something about the kind of person you are. You have to have something in you.”
Or maybe Svalbard is where you go to find it. On midsummer, my shipmates and I stripped down and jumped into the ocean from the side of the boat. The water is not like other cold water—not the chilly North Atlantic, not an icy shower, not even the cold pool at a Russian bathhouse. It does not register as having a temperature at all. Swimming in the Arctic is a senseless act, but it brings you to your senses. Afterward, you feel weightless, like everything is new. You feel almost polar.
When you spend enough time at sea, especially while writing, you come to a deeper understanding of many maritime clichés: to be in the same boat, make waves, and have the wind in your sails. And then there’s cabin fever. I can describe it only as a mania of the limbs, a wrestling of the spirit trying to escape its human cage. It is my idea of bodily hell, and I fought it until our landing at Sarstangen, a sliver of a beach jutting into a glassy sound with a blurring palette of blues and whites—sea, ice, clouds, and sky—stretching out to the horizon. If it hadn’t been for the stench of a nearby walrus colony, it was how I imagined heaven. But then I looked down; the ground was covered in trash.
The refuse of humanity came in all shapes, colors, and textures—yellow fishing nets, rusted tin cans, pink candy wrappers, a black TV. We picked up as much as we could, filling white bags that we dragged back across the sand to our Zodiacs so we could drop them off in Longyearbyen. It was so distracting that we couldn’t look up.
Even without the spectacle of Arctic garbage, we encountered human damage at every stop—glaciers calving as though they were losing their teeth, their shorelines receding like sickly gums. It put the idea of sovereignty into perspective in a different, cosmic way: Who are any of us to be here at all?
In the modern world, the concept of state sovereignty governs how we govern. Its legitimacy is rarely questioned, even though it is a human invention—the setting of borders, the wielding of power, the deciding of who belongs. But in the Arctic, as in any remote place, it’s obvious that we’re not actually in charge.
We carry no special privileges or diplomatic immunities in spaces where nature makes the rules. It is absurd to impose the construct of the nation-state, what with its laws and regulations, on something so wild, so unruly. Svalbard’s landscape disregards any concept of national borders, of industrial time, or of politics as we know it. We aren’t its citizens, residents, or denizens; we are its guests.
No wonder it’s a place that, for a hundred years, has quietly challenged what countries can do. . ",False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False

MOSJ (Environmental Monitoring of Svalbard and Jan Mayen) is an environmental monitoring system and part of the Government’s environmental monitoring in Norway. An important function is to provide a basis for seeing whether the political targets set for the development of the environment in the North are being attained. The environmental goals for the polar regions are presented at State of the Environment Norway.
MOSJ focuses on environmental information that is strategically important for politicians and environmental managers. Consequently, considerably more environmental monitoring takes place in Svalbard and Jan Mayen than that which is included in MOSJ.
A thorough scientific understanding of the state of the environment there requires that we monitor far more than what may at the moment seem most relevant for decision making. This takes place in thematic monitoring programmes performed by, for instance
- The Norwegian Polar Institute (NPI)
- The Norwegian Institute for Air Research (NILU)
- The Norwegian Meteorological Institute (MET)
- The Norwegian Institute of Marine Research (IMR)
MOSJ obtains relevant information from these programmes on land, in the air and in the sea. Examples are monitoring of pollutants in the air in Ny-Ålesund, commercially valuable species of fish, and temperature and precipitation.
MOSJ employs a selection of key indicators from the various thematic programmes and places them in context across disciplines and topics. This can create new understanding of connections between different kinds of environmental pressures and impacts in the natural world.
Good environmental monitoring must be built on research. It is research that can tell us what is most relevant to monitor; for example, when we want to find indicator species which can give a typical picture of an ecosystem. Research is also necessary to find out how we must monitor, in other words, which methods are most appropriate. In addition, we need research to be able to interpret and explain the data collected through monitoring. These are important reasons why research must be closely integrated with monitoring programmes.
The MOSJ structure
MOSJ consists of a number of indicators which contain one or more data sets. An indicator gives a simplified description of the reality.
Environmental indicators should contain information on what is typical or critical for the environmental quality. They should be able to show whether a development is positive or negative. Comparison with reference values should say whether the state is good or poor. Each indicator has one or more parameters (data sets).
Most environmental monitoring systems, such as State of the Environment Norway, sort the information according to Driving forces – Pressures – States – Impacts – Responses (the DPSIR model). The objective is to display the connection between human activities and the environment.
MOSJ only has indicators for pressure and state.
The indicators for climate are difficult to classify while we only use these two divisions. If we study emissions of greenhouse gases and measures to combat undesirable changes in climate, the indicators in MOSJ will mostly be indicators for state. If we are interested in changes in the plant and animal life, the climate will be an important pressure factor. This is why we have differentiated climate as a separate area in MOSJ.
Proposals for responses are given in the state of the environment reports which MOSJ produces. MOSJ gives recommendations to the individual authorities which are responsible. It is up to these, both environmental authorities and various sectors, to decide how far they will follow the recommendations.
Interpretations of data sets
MOSJ is not just a system for presenting data, it also interprets the data.
An explanation of what the monitoring shows is given for each indicator. This is done by assessing whether or not a trend in the development exists and, based on this, whether the status can be characterised as good or poor as indicated by reference values or norms.
Possible causes and impacts of a trend must also be assessed.
Evaluations of the state of the environment
Emphasis is placed on performing assessments of the state of the environment based on all other relevant knowledge, since the MOSJ data alone cannot explain all aspects of the development.
MOSJ normally undertakes such assessments of the state of the environment annually, and the topic varies from year to year. These assessments attempt to determine whether the national environmental goals for Svalbard are being attained or, in more general terms, whether there are aspects which give cause for concern.
If the goals are not being attained, or worrying aspects in the development are observed, an assessment must determine whether a response should be set in motion and, if so, who is responsible for it. MOSJ will then send recommendations to the responsible authorities.
It is often concluded that there is a need for better knowledge to have an adequate basis for assessing goals and aspects in the development. MOSJ can then recommend starting new or improved monitoring, or recommend that new research be started. MOSJ and the data suppliers are dependent upon the authorities or other bodies complying with these recommendations and starting responses.
Organisation of MOSJ
The Section for Environmental Management at the Norwegian Polar Institute is the secretariat for MOSJ and consequently has principal responsibility for developing and operating the system. Persons to contact are Therese Sigurdsen and Stein Ø. Nilsen. The Norwegian Polar Institute is responsible for the MOSJ web site.
The MOSJ Scientific Board comprises representatives from
- The Norwegian Environment Agency
- The Directorate for Cultural Heritage
- The Governor of Svalbard
- The Norwegian Institute of Marine Research
- The Norwegian Meteorological Institute
- The Norwegian Polar Institute
Its most important tasks are to give advice on which indicators should be included in MOSJ and how they should be prioritised, discuss the most important problems linked with the further development of the indicators, including which management-related questions the monitoring should answer, help to ensure that monitoring is started and is reported to MOSJ, and advise management authorities on the need for responses and institutions on the need for knowledge.
The data presented in MOSJ come from many institutions which perform monitoring. The individual data suppliers are responsible for the quality assurance of their data and for interpreting trends in the individual data set.
The principal data suppliers are
- The Norwegian Polar Institute
- The Governor of Svalbard
- The Norwegian Institute of Marine Research
- The Norwegian Institute for Air Research
- The Norwegian Meteorological Institute
- The Norwegian Institute for Nature Research . Pollutants in polar bears (Ursus maritimus)
The total stress of pollutants in polar bears in Svalbard is dominated by fat-soluble organic pollutants, their metabolites and perfluorinated compounds. Polar bears are exposed to high levels of persistent contaminants, increasing in concentration higher in the food chain. The monitoring shows a significant reduction in fat-soluble organic pollutants that are internationally regulated, but an increase in mercury levels.
What is being monitored?
Persistent organic pollutants, perfluorinated compounds and mercury

Method
The Norwegian Polar Institute collects samples from polar bears in Svalbard every year during the spring season from April to May. Polar bears are tranquillised from helicopters, and blood samples, fat biopsies and hair samples are taken for analysis of pollutants, trophic location and carbon source (measurement of stable isotopes). The bears are also weighed and measured in order to determine their body condition, and a tooth is extracted to enable age estimation. Habitat use is also monitored using satellite collars fitted to a number of female bears.
Body condition, age, number of cubs, diet and area are included in the statistical analyses in order to test whether these are factors which could impact on pollutant levels in polar bears. In addition, only female polar bears are included in the time trend studies in order to eliminate any gender differences.
Analysis of pollutants in polar bear plasma is performed by the laboratory of environmental contaminants at Norwegian University of Life Sciences. Fat is extracted from blood plasma for analysis of bromated and chlorinated pollutants. Contaminants in fat extracts are separated and quantified using gas chromatography as described in Bernhoft et al., 1997; Bytingsvik et al., 2012; Henriksen et al., 2001; and Tartu et al., 2017. Analysis of perfluorinated compounds in bloodplasma are described by Tartu et al. 2017b and Routti et al. 2017. Analysis of mercury in hair samples was carried out by Trace Metal Lab of Aarhus University, as described by Lippold et al. 2020.
Quality
The laboratory is quality checked and accredited. The work is carried out in accordance with AMAP’s guidelines for sampling and analysis. The laboratory regularly takes part in international proficiency testing schemes.

Reference level and action level
Since PCB and other pollutants are manufactured pollutants that are not found in a natural state, the reference value for an unaffected state will be zero (really the detection limit). Mercury from both natural and anthropogenic sources occurs in nature. Anthropogenic sources are estimated to account for about 90% of mercury exposure in polar bears.
The effects of pollutants in polar bears have been investigated using correlative studies looking at links between pollutant levels and various impact parameters amongst polar bears. Cell-based studies and modelling studies (comparison with limit values for impacts on other species) have also been carried out looking at the effects of pollutants in polar bears. The results of these studies indicate that there is reason to believe that the pollutant load could impact on the health of polar bears in Svalbard.
Status and trend
Geographical trend
Pelagic polar bears from the Barents Sea, which follow the ice eastwards when the ice around Svalbard melts during the summer, have a higher intake of organic pollutants compared with coastal polar bears which remain around Svalbard throughout the year. There are several reasons for these differences. For example, pelagic polar bears eat a higher proportion of marine prey and at a higher trophic level than the coastal polar bears. They also have higher energy requirements and thus a higher intake of prey. Despite these higher energy requirements, pelagic polar bears were fatter compared with coastal bears. This is probably due to their high intake of seals throughout the year. In addition, pelagic polar bears eat a higher proportion of prey which they catch in the marginal ice zone and prey which are closer to polluting emission sources/transport routes. These are factors which could impact on the intake of pollutants. Although the intake of pollutants is higher in pelagic polar bears, concentrations of fat-soluble pollutants in the blood are similar if one compares levels in pelagic and coastal polar bears. Pelagic individuals have more fat on their body and the fat-soluble pollutants are mainly concentrated here. Levels of PFAS, on the other hand, which are not fat-soluble pollutants, occur in higher concentrations in the blood of pelagic polar bears.
Polar bears from Svalbard show approximately three times higher levels of perfluorinated substances (PFOS and perfluorinated carboxylic acids (∑PFCA)) than polar bears from eastern Greenland or Canada. Amongst the other pollutants which were measured, no unambiguous differences in trends have been found between polar bears from Svalbard and other polar bear populations. Mercury levels were significantly lower in polar bears from the Barents Sea compared with those in polar bears from Canada and Greenland.
Species trends
Polar bears are apex predators and thus have a high intake of pollutants which accumulate over time and become concentrated (biomagnified) in the food chain. Concentrations of fat-soluble pollutants such as PCBs, chlordanes and DDE in polar bears are significantly higher than in their main prey, ringed seal, but lower than those observed in orca. Levels of PCBs and chlorinated pesticides in polar bears from Svalbard are similar to those found in arctic foxes, while levels of perfluorinated compounds are significantly higher.
Time trends
Monitoring of polar bears in Svalbard indicates a mean decrease in concentrations of PCBs, β-HCH, oxyc-chlorodan and BDE-47 during the period between 1991 and 2017. Although there are wide variations in levels between years, the levels have on average decreased if one compares the concentrations in polar bears from the 1990s to the present day.
On average, DDE and HCB levels decreased through to 2010 (21% per year for DDE and 11% per year for HCB).
Levels of PFOS in polar bears decreased by an average of 14% per year between 2003 and 2009, but have remained stable since then. In contrast, PFNA and PFUnDA levels increased by an average of 2.5% and 2% per year respectively between 2000 and 2014. Like the other pollutants being measured, these pollutants also show wide variations between years. Reported time trends were not affected by age, body condition or number of cubs. Mercury levels increased over time, particularly during the latter half of the study period.
Effect of climate-related changes on diet and access to food
In recent studies, levels and time trends of pollutants in polar bears from Svalbard have been investigated in relation to climate-related changes in body condition, diet and habitat use.
Sea ice is the most important hunting area for polar bears during the winter/spring. When there is little sea ice around, polar bears draw on their body fat, and pollutants stored in the fat become more concentrated and are released into the bloodstream when the animal becomes hungry. This leads to elevated concentrations of pollutants in tissue and blood, and the pollutants become available and are absorbed by vital organs such as the liver and brain. Results from a recent study from Svalbard show that polar bears had higher levels of fat-soluble pollutants in their blood and fat in the spring than in autumn, particularly after winters with little ice.
Concentrations of PFAS in polar bears were mainly affected by diet, and polar bears with a high intake of prey from marine sources generally had higher levels of PFAS compared with polar bears which eat prey from terrestrial sources. This may be because terrestrial food chains are shorter than marine food chains, and because PFAS therefore has less potential for enrichment in terrestrial food chains compared with marine food chains. In addition, levels of many PFAS compounds were higher in polar bears that had recently fasted than in those which had eaten recently.
The diet of polar bears has changed over time; they eat less marine prey high up the food chain today than they tended to do in the past. These changes did not affect the observed time trends of organic pollutants in polar bears.
Mercury levels were lower in polar bears with a more terrestrial diet compared with polar bears with a more marine diet. When mercury levels were adjusted for changes in diet, the increase was somewhat faster, but the difference between the trends was not significant.
Causal factors
There is one main reason why the levels of the so-called old organic pollutants in polar bears are sinking. Their manufacture and use are nationally and internationally regulated. Efforts to regulate PCBs and chlorinated pesticides started in the late 1970s, and the international ban on the contaminants took effect in 2004, through the Stockholm Convention. The main sources of emissions of these contaminants has therefore stalled. The reason for the contaminants still being present in the environment is because they are stable and that they can be recycled and concentrated in the food chain. Increases in DDE and HCB levels since 2010 are probably due to the melting of ice and permafrost.
Production and use of the newer POPs BDE-47 and PFOS have been restricted in the past 15-20 years. Tetra-BDE, penta-BDE, hexa-BDE, hepta-BDE and PFOS were included in the Stockholm Convention in 2009, while deca-BDE was included in 2017. Other perfluorinated substances, such as PFNA and PFUnDA, are regulated at national level in some countries, but the precursors of these substances are not currently regulated.
The rising mercury levels are probably driven by secondary emissions from melting sea ice and permafrost. Mercury emissions are regulated by international initiatives, the Minamata Convention on Mercury.
Consequences
Levels of organic pollutants remain high in polar bears, and polar bear cubs have been shown to have more than twice the level of fat-soluble pollutants compared with adult female polar bears.
Impact studies of polar bears have shown that the pollutant load can impact on the activity of important molecules in the brain, the immune system and hormones which are important for developmental processes and energy metabolism. Pollutants also have the ability to interfere with fat storage and fat-burning processes in polar bears.
The high levels of pollutants in polar bears, particularly in polar bear cubs, are disturbing, as these substances can impact on development, and make polar bears more susceptible to infection and disease. Changes in the functioning of genes have been linked to elevated levels of pollutants in polar bear cubs.
Like many other Arctic animals, polar bears have seasonal variations in their body condition. Female polar bears burn body fat when in their dens, and also lose a high proportion of their fat reserves when suckling their cubs. Polar bears also lose body fat when they are unable to find enough food and have to draw on their fat reserves.
Periods of hunger and drawing on body fat are natural for the polar bear, but can be critical because pollutants stored in their fatty tissue become more concentrated (in fat) and are released into the bloodstream when fat is burned. The pollutants then become available and are taken up by organs such as the liver and brain.
Polar bears also have high levels of PCB metabolites. This is because polar bears convert PCBs into water-soluble metabolites very effectively. The purpose of such conversion processes is to convert contaminants into other compounds that are more easily dissolved in water, and can thereby be excreted from the body. In this process, metabolites of PCBs are produced which remain in the body, and these compounds are often more toxic than the original PCB congeners.
About the monitoring
The polar bear is a predator at the top of the marine food chain in the Arctic, mainly eating seals hunted at the sea ice.
Current levels of pollutants could impact on polar bear health, which represents a threat to the polar bear population of Svalbard. Climate change, with reduced sea ice cover, could also indirectly affect levels of pollutants in polar bears, and further monitoring is therefore necessary.

The pair were spotted with their mother on the icy coast of Svalbard, a Norwegian archipelago about halfway between the mainland and the North Pole.
The black plastic stands out against the otherwise spotless landscape as the white-furred bears were captured pawing at it before putting it in their mouths.
The images are likely to spark yet further debate about use of the artificial products in industrialised countries following outcry about plastic pollution. Concern over microplastics and other forms of the product has spiked in recent years, particularly since the broadcast of the BBC’s Planet Earth II.
Svalbard is hundreds of miles from continental Europe and has a population of about 2,500, yet researchers navigating the freezing waters found plastic waste wherever they went.
Claire Wallerstein was part of the Sail Against Plastic team, a group of 15 Cornish scientists, artists, filmmakers and campaigners who recently returned from an expedition to the Arctic Circle.
She said: “We were very lucky to be invited to take part in this unique expedition, and had an amazing time seeing Arctic wildlife, stunning glaciers and experiencing 24-hour sunlight.
“However, it was also a very sobering experience to see just how much plastic is making its way to this incredibly remote and apparently pristine environment.”
The aim of the trip was to research the impact of plastics on the marine environment just 600 miles from the North Pole.
Ms Wallerstein added: “What we found on the beaches was sadly not so very different from what we find back home.
“There was plenty of fishing waste, but the saddest thing was just how much of the waste blighting the Arctic is the same old disposable detritus of our daily lives – plastic bottles, cotton bud sticks, cigarette ends, wet wipes, polystyrene and food packaging.”
The group sailed aboard a tall ship named the Blue Clipper, spending 10 days sampling the sea, air and beaches around the isolated coasts of Svalbard.
Although twice the size of Belgium, Svalbard’s human population is outnumbered by polar bears.
One picture captured by the group shows a team member holding a discarded plastic bag with the logo of a polar bear and the word Svalbardbutikken, a supermarket on the island.
The group trawled for microplastics in the water, and large floating plastics.
They also tested the air for microplastic fibres, listened for underwater noise pollution, and cleaned beaches.
The team found plastics on beaches at every site they surveyed, including some that must have travelled long distances.
“Our microplastic net sampled the surface waters in areas where there is currently little research.
“Once the samples are analysed back in the UK, this data will indicate the levels of microplastic pollution in Arctic waters around Svalbard.”
With currents reaching Svalbard from both the Atlantic and Siberia, debris can arrive from far away.
Local beach cleaners have reportedly found plastic waste traceable to as far abroad as Florida, and the researchers said this would inevitably impact Arctic wildlife.
According to the team, almost 90 per cent of fulmars – a white seabird related to the albatross – around the island have been found to have plastic in their guts, with an average of 15 pieces per animal.
The expedition spent a few days in Svalbard’s capital Longyearbyen after their endeavours to find out about the initiatives under way to clean up hazardous litter from the island’s remote beaches.

Glaciers are the canary down the mine when it comes to the climate crisis and our time is running out, warn Brice Noël and Michiel van den Broeke
he archipelago of Svalbard, a land of ice and polar bears, is found midway between mainland Norway and the North Pole. Its capital Longyearbyen, on the main island of Spitsbergen, is the world’s most northerly city, some 800 miles inside the Arctic Circle.
Svalbard is also home to some of the Earth’s northernmost glaciers, which bury most of the archipelago’s surface under no less than 200 metres of thick ice. Taken together, Svalbard glaciers represent 6 per cent of the worldwide glacier area outside the large ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica – if they totally melted, they would raise the sea level by 1.7cm.
Because they are so far north, these glaciers are found at relatively low elevations, mostly below 450m above sea level compared to 800m or more elsewhere in the Arctic. Moreover, they are shaped like domes with steep sides and extensive flat interiors. These peculiar features make Svalbard glaciers highly vulnerable to climate warming, as we discovered in our research now published in Nature Communications.
Svalbard has a relatively dry climate, and each year the amount of meltwater exceeds the amount of snowfall that nourishes the glaciers. This was the case even before the climate started to warm in earnest. So how do these glaciers survive such unfavourable conditions?
Their secret is hidden below the surface, in a mantle of cold, compressed snow – called “firn” – that covers the glaciers’ interior. The porous firn layer can be up to 40m deep, and acts as a sponge that can store massive amounts of meltwater in its air pockets.
About half of all meltwater produced on Svalbard in the Arctic summer is stored and refrozen in the firn layer, preserving glacial mass by preventing the water from flowing into the ocean. When the glaciers stop melting in winter, the buffer capacity of the firn layer is replenished by the accumulation of fresh, fluffy snow, prepping it to store next summer’s wave of meltwater.
Being located at the margin of the rapidly declining sea ice cover in the Arctic Ocean, Svalbard is among the fastest warming regions on Earth. And this warming is testing the limits of the firn layer’s capacity to store meltwater.
Rising air temperature in the mid-1980s considerably increased the amount of water that was melting across the glaciers and rapidly filled the air pockets in the firn, progressively weakening its buffer capacity. To make matters worse, the firn layer retreated fast inland to reach the elevation of 450m – a critical point that left more than half of the archipelago’s glacier area unprotected.
The disappearance of firn leaves glaciers without their protective buffer, exposing the underlying dark bare ice at the surface. As dark ice absorbs more sunlight than the brighter firn, melt increased even further.
The rapid retreat of firn in the mid-1980s triggered a period of sustained mass loss, which has been confirmed by satellite observations. The loss of the meltwater buffer makes Svalbard glaciers highly vulnerable to a further temperature rise. In the warm summer of 2013, water reached the ocean from three-quarters of the glacier area, and mass loss more than doubled compared to previous years. In July 2020, Svalbard experienced record high temperatures once again. Some climatologists predict increases of up to 10℃ by the end of this century – if that happens, the archipelago’s glaciers could completely disappear in the next 400 years.
Further warming will completely reshape Svalbard’s climate, its landscape and its fragile ecosystems. Rain will progressively replace snowfall. Glaciers will trade their white firn mantle for dark ice. Open waters will invade fjords as sea ice and floating glacier tongues retreat. On land, receding glaciers will leave behind moraines and lakes as a reminiscence of a bygone glacial era. The landscape will start to resemble that of Iceland today, with bare rocks surrounded by grass, mosses and shrubs.
The retreating ice will allow increased human activity, including mining, farming and tourism, and further increase the pressure on the wildlife, including the polar bears. Already, polar bears are more frequently sighted on land as the rapid decline in sea ice has forced them to adapt and look for new hunting grounds, endangering both humans and the animals themselves.
Being located among the fastest warming regions on Earth, Svalbard glaciers are the canary in the coal mine. They can be seen as thermometers monitoring the devastating impacts of the climate crisis. It may not be too late to save part of Svalbard’s glacial landscape and the fragile ecosystems it supports, but time is quickly running out.Brice Noël is a post-doctoral researcher at the institute for marine and atmospheric research, Utrecht University.

cnn,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/arctic-university-longyearbyen/index.html ,"(CNN) — In the land of the midnight sun and the northern lights, in the most fragile ecosystem on the planet, you'll find the world's northernmost university.
Students from around the world are flocking to the spectacularly remote University Centre in Svalbard (UNIS), which lies at a latitude of 78 degrees north, in the Arctic Sea, midway between Norway and the North Pole.
Their presence reveals how an increasing number of people want to incorporate international travel -- even to somewhere remote and potentially hostile -- in their studies.
It could also change how this corner of the Arctic learns to make the most of tourism.
There are now 600 students and 75 staff -- a huge surge since the university started out in 1993 with an intake of 30.
UNIS is based in Longyearbyen, a Norwegian community of 2,000 residents in the de-militarized Svalbard archipelago.
Russia is the only other country to have a permanent settlement in the region.
World's northernmost settlement
Getting here involves a flight to Svalbard Airport.
I arrive in the full hazy daylight of summer -- even though the time's around midnight.
A three-kilometer bus ride takes me to Longyearbyen, the world's northernmost settlement.
This has long been a coal mining community, but low profitability and environmental concerns have led to many mines closing, and unemployment is hitting hard.
There's a lot riding on the success of UNIS.
Fjords, valleys and glaciers
Might want to make plans for a campus visit next summer. August is the most traveler-friendly season.
Anisha Shah
The university's location is striking -- the glaciated valley of Longyeardalen, lapped by a serene icy fjord, in a tiny city entirely encased in snow-encrusted mountains.
Distant gigantic glaciers glisten in late summer sunlight.
My visit is in August, the most traveler-friendly season for an 11-day circumnavigation of the archipelago by ship, departing from Longyearbyen.
Arctic studies
Courses such as arctic geophysics, geology and biology are enticing natural science students from affiliated universities around the world for a four-month semester.
UNIS is poised to offer its first full degree or masters program as part of planned expansion.
For many undergraduates, the Arctic is their first taste of practical outdoor fieldwork.
It's a key part of studies here, and the students I spoke to feel privileged to do it in such a unique setting.
One semester proves too little time -- many return for further studies or as professors.
""We've had midnight barbecues and hikes through summer's midnight sun,"" says Arctic geophysics student Tom Simmons, from England.
""I can't wait to see aurora borealis and perpetual polar darkness. I've already decided to apply for the spring semester too.""
Arctic oil drilling
Study and adventure. An increasing number of students want both here.
Anisha Shah
The frozen landscapes of the Arctic are drawing worldwide attention, with controversial drilling for oil having been scrapped as uneconomical by Shell, a move seen as a victory for environmentalists.
Climate change conversation centers on this pristine yet fragile region.
""Given the beauty of the surroundings, I already feel connected to Svalbard,"" says geophysics student Stijn Van der Waal, from Holland.
""We've been hearing about climate change and it does unease me, as a scientist.""
Research done by students here has the power to influence industry policy.
""Most university research is highly specialized to Svalbard,"" says UNIS information manager Eva Therese Jenssen.
""One student had his research, on thriving undersea life during winter darkness, published.
""A masters student presented his findings on the introduction of alien species from visitor foot-flow. They're now considering a cleansing procedure at Svalbard Airport.""
Dog sleds and snowmobiles
Conditions couldn't be more extreme, with winter temperatures plummeting to -15 C (5 F) in a city with no road connections anywhere.
Locals commute by dog sled and snowmobiles -- quad bikes on skis -- to navigate panoramic ice.
Student Paul Petersik, from Germany, loves it.
""I will get a snowmobile to travel beyond this settlement,"" he says. ""I love spontaneity with the outdoors and Longyearbyen is a dream travel launchpad.""
Day one at UNIS is unlike the start of university anywhere else.
The first lesson is safety, with firearm training.
A rifle is required by law for anyone leaving Longyearbyen.
Polar bears, the world's largest predator to actively hunt humans, can be encountered anywhere.
""We encourage students to independently explore this special region and equip them to be safe,"" says Jenssen.
Petersik recalls an unforgettable camping trip by a frozen lake in the mountains: ""A polar bear had previously been sighted in a valley next to the lake, so we took turns staying awake to be on armed polar bear guard.
""One morning, I was late for uni as I was trapped in my barracks by reindeer outside my door,"" says geology student Svenja Rudolph.
It didn't put her off, she's applied for another semester.
Global research hub
Norway's government has injected subsidies into the last operational mines in Svalbard, which also maintains Norway's settlement policy on the Arctic archipelago.
But with whispers of closure, the region's prospects hang in the balance.
The university could be central in securing Longyearbyen's future.
Talks have begun to potentially take over a coal mine barracks in nearby Svea, should the mine be phased out.
""If this happens, UNIS could expand facilities to become a research hub, attracting scientists globally to study the precious Arctic ecosystem and beyond,"" says Jenssen. ""The more we know, the more we can protect it.
""It would also mean jobs, tourism and more income.""
At Longyearbyen, the world's most northerly university, lessons in survival are part of the curriculum.

By offering further education programs and diversifying courses, the university hopes to raise awareness of the arctic environment.
During my 11-day circumnavigation of Svalbard, I meet former UNIS student Mario Placidi Spring, now an expedition guide.
He took the yearlong arctic nature guide course.
""Tourists to Svalbard are well-informed, so the course taught me the 'hard skills' of multi-day excursions on glaciers and hiking, whilst educating guests on issues affecting the region,"" he says. ""It highlights the plight of the Arctic.""
Expansion for success
To make way for changes, UNIS is expanding both its main building and student accommodations.
Arctic 2030 is Norway's new grant scheme aimed at investment in the High North.
It's hoped that the the university will be central to Longyearbyen and its population, long after coal mining.
Research conducted by students would focus on the surrounding environment.
For the Arctic, it can't come soon enough.
Application deadline for spring semester is October 15

sintef,https://www.sintef.no/en/latest-news/2021/found-traces-of-antidepressants-and-painkillers-in-crustaceans-on-svalbard/ ,"Researchers from SINTEF, the Norwegian Polar Institute and the University Centre in Svalbard have collected samples from Arctic crustaceans close to the settlement of Ny-Ålesund on the west coast of Spitsbergen. During the spring and summer, they discovered a number of drugs in a variety of different concentrations.
“These included ibuprofen from Ibux, diclofenac from Voltaren, antibiotics and an antidepressant,” says SINTEF researcher Ida Beathe Øverjordet.
The aim of the project is to study our footprint on the natural world – to measure how much material is discharged, and what significance this has. The results may have an impact on the way in which we manage the Arctic regions in the future.
“It’s easy to assume that this won’t be an issue because there are so few people living in this area. However, the fact is that we found many traces of drugs in the animals,” says Øverjordet.
Surprising discoveries
The first thing that the researchers noticed was the high levels of ibuprofen in all the animals.
“Ibux is a commonly used drug with quite a long lifetime in the environment compared with medications such as paracetamol, which often breaks down very rapidly. So this wasn’t such a surprising discovery,” says Øverjordet. “However, what did surprise us was that the concentrations of the drug were so high, considering that the area is so sparsely inhabited.”
Since crustaceans, such as copepods, occupy the lowest levels of the food pyramid, compounds in the drugs will be passed upwards to larger animals. Copepods constitute the basis for much of the life in the Arctic because they are rich in fats, and are thus essential to building and maintaining the fat reserves of Arctic fish and seabird species.
Similarly, finding traces of drugs such as antibiotics and diclofenac wasn’t so strange, since these medications are also in common use.
“Somewhat more surprising was that we discovered less commonly used drugs such as antidepressants,” says Øverjordet.
Only 30 permanent inhabitants
Ny-Ålesund is populated by service personnel and researchers from ten different countries. There are only 30 permanent inhabitants, but in summer, visiting researchers and seasonal workers can boost the population to as many as 200 people, all of whom are between the ages of 20 and 70, and are generally healthy and in good condition. There will also be some tourists visiting for short periods – the majority just for day trips.
“One of our next steps will be to find out what drugs are used in the area, and to compare the results with what we find in the local sewage and living organisms,” says Øverjordet. “We’re particularly interested in examining seasonal variations in order to get an idea of what medications are taken locally compared with what is brought in by the tourists who are only making short visits,” she says.
Same concentrations as in Tromsø
This study is part of a research project called PharmArctic, which is being funded by the flagship research programme Miljøgifter at the Fram Research Centre in Tromsø. The programme focuses on generating knowledge about the impacts of environmental toxins on Arctic ecosystems, and is looking into the links between the concentrations of pharmaceutical drugs and cosmetic products and discharges from settlements and tourism in the Arctic.
In an earlier study of sewage from the town of Longyearbyen, also on the west coast of Spitsbergen, it was shown that the concentrations of some drugs were equivalent to, or even higher than, those recorded for cities such as Tromsø, which has a much higher population.
The general lack of sewage decontamination due to permafrost and low temperatures is a constant problem in the Arctic, including on Svalbard.
“Only 2,500 people live in Longyearbyen, but each year, many thousands of tourists visit for long or short stays, all making their contribution to the substances that get discharged in the sewage,” says Øverjordet. “However, the main reason for the high concentrations is the lack of sewage decontamination in Longyearbyen. Everything is simply discharged straight into the fjord.”
The general lack of sewage decontamination due to permafrost and low temperatures is a constant problem in the Arctic, including on Svalbard.
Ny-Ålesund installed a very basic raw sewage decontamination system in 2018, and as part of their future work, researchers will be studying differences in drug concentrations in the samples collected before and after decontamination was introduced.
Impact on regulatory governance
The project’s findings may be used to influence the future management of the Arctic regions, as well as national and international regulatory governance, both on land and at sea.
“It’s true that cruise ships are not permitted to discharge their sewage close to land, but if the compounds have a long environmental lifetime, they may still cause problems,” Øverjordet explains.
At the moment, we know very little about the concentrations and levels of exposure that Arctic wildlife have to pharmaceutical drugs, and how big this problem really is.
Are pharmaceutical drugs hazardous to wildlife?
The crustaceans from which samples were taken are small planktonic organisms called copepods and amphipods, which live on the seabed and in the water column.
“These animals have different ways of life, which in turn influence the types of environmental toxins to which they are exposed and thus how much they ingest,” says Øverjordet. “Amphipods, for example, are benthic organisms that feed on carrion and other organic material that is deposited on the seabed, and may thus be exposed to more of the environmental toxins that accumulate there,” she says.
To date, the research team has not identified any drug concentrations as being hazardous to Arctic wildlife, though it has been shown that the drugs clearly are ingested.
“Since these crustaceans occupy the lowest levels of the food pyramid, compounds in the drugs will be passed upwards to larger animals,” says Øverjordet. “Copepods constitute the basis for much of the life in the Arctic because they are rich in fats and are thus essential to building and maintaining the fat reserves of Arctic fish and seabird species.”
The drugs in question may impact wildlife in a number of ways. Various other studies have shown that antidepressants alter the behaviour of zooplankton and fish, and that this may have an impact on their survival, as well as a number of other effects.
“We don’t know what the tolerance levels are for Arctic wildlife species,” says Øverjordet. “This is something we will be studying in the future.”
Too little data and knowledge
In the future, the researchers will be analysing the sewage samples from Longyearbyen and Ny-Ålesund that were collected at intervals during the summer of 2020.
“Samples of both sewage and seawater have been taken to measure the concentrations of drugs in the water,” says Øverjordet. “The sewage samples will give us an indication of how much is discharged from the settlements during a given season. We have very little data on Arctic wildlife species, so we’re hoping that the results from our initial project will provide a basis for more research in this area,” she says.
The researchers have applied to expand their studies both on Svalbard and in Greenland. . ",False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False

bigissue,https://www.bigissue.com/latest/environment/inside-the-future-of-humanity-svalbards-global-seed-vault/ ,"On the frozen archipelago of Svalbard, halfway between the north of mainland Norway and the North Pole, is the Global Seed Vault.
This inhospitable but breathtaking landscape is home to the ultimate storage solution designed to safeguard the seeds of the world’s most important crops.
Constructed in 2008 and run as a joint initiative between Norway’s Ministry of Agriculture, the Crop Trust and the Nordic Genetic Resource Centre (NordGen), the Vault is used by gene banks, governments, universities and research facilities from every continent. If their own collections are compromised, if there is mass crop failure due to disease, if food supply chains are disrupted by conflict – or should there be any other doomsday scenario from zombie apocalypse to asteroid impact – the Global Seed Vault could be humanity’s best hope for survival.
Stored 130 metres deep inside a mountain are more than a million frozen seeds, kept at a chilled -18C. They represent more than 5,000 plant species with many more varieties of each (for example 40,000 types of bean, 156,000 kinds of wheat).
Svalbard was chosen as the perfect location because its cold climate means that even if power fails, seeds should be kept frozen by the surrounding permafrost. Its remoteness also makes it especially secure. The complex is protected by the Norwegian government agency Statsbygg and any trespassers might also have to contend with Svalbard’s population of polar bears, which outnumber human residents. Although they tend to keep far away from this part of Svalbard, pawprints have been found nearby in the past.
“You never know…” warns Åsmund Asdal.
If the Global Seed Vault is an ark to preserve life on Earth then Åsmund Asdal is its Noah.
Seed Vault Co-ordinator since 2015, Asdal is matter-of-fact in the way you’d want the potential saviour of the human race to be.
“It’s like a black box,” he says about the Seed Vault’s role. “One of the things you should do if you have some valuable papers is have a copy. Gene banks have seed collections that are very valuable but vulnerable if they are only in one place. For security they keep copies in Svalbard.”
New deposits are made up to six times annually, with around four to six new gene banks adding to the project each year.
“We are in touch with gene banks all over the world,” Asdal explains. “We give them the information they need. We inform them about options for depositing seeds. We organise the agreements and formal procedures. We organise the shipment of seeds from the gene banks to Svalbard and when the seeds arrive we bring the seeds into the Seed Vault. I am responsible for all these operations.”
This period is the busiest for Asdal and his team. Today [Tuesday February 25], representatives from dozens of gene banks around the world have travelled to Svalbard to make the biggest mass deposit since the Seed Vault’s opening.
Longyearbyen, three kilometres from the Vault, is the largest settlement on Svalbard, feeling like an outpost on the edge of the Earth. In the town’s cultural centre, Kulturhuset, international experts very literally leading the field of crop diversity and food security have come together for a day of talks and networking at the Svalbard Seed Summit. The theme: ‘Genetic diversity for more resilient food systems,’ exploring what measures need to be taken to safeguard crops in the face of the climate crisis.
Asdal presents the findings of long-term experiments he is conducting.
“We have what we call the 100-year experiment. We put seeds of Nordic crops in there in 1986 and every fifth year we take some out and test germination.
“Seeds do not last forever. You have to replace old seeds with new seeds now and then. That is what gene banks do. Some species can stay 50 years. Some species can stay 1,000 years. The knowledge about longevity is insufficient. That’s why we are having this experiment.”
After the summit, the delegation hop on to buses and drive along a windy road past dumpy reindeer on the slopes to the Vault, looming out of the darkness like a Bond villain’s lair. The outside temperature has slipped close to the -18C level inside the Vault, but the effects of the climate crisis can clearly be felt in this land of extremes. Today it was an incredibly unseasonable high of 1C.
The Svalbard Seed Vault has just undergone an extensive £16.7m building programme. The entrance tunnel was flooded by rainfall and melting permafrost in early 2017 after Svalbard experienced temperatures seven degrees higher than normal that winter. Since then they have made the tunnel watertight, as well as upgrading the cooling and security systems.
The need for renovations is a sign that climate change is happening faster than previously predicted, according to Erna Solberg, prime minster of Norway: “Now we have planned for worst-case scenarios in a better way,” she says.
Outside the Seed Vault, Solberg greets the gene bank representatives and speaks proudly of the part Norway is playing.
“I believe that more and more countries are seeing that to safeguard their genetics, seeds and biodiversity of their country it’s important that you store in different places,” she says.
“Biodiversity is part of climate change. We have to make sure we are planning for changes in the climate to make sure we can feed the people of the world in the future.”
If you pay for the magazine you should always take it. Vendors are working for a hand up, not a handout.
The name of each gene bank is read out like nations entering the Olympic arena, Solberg presents certificates, and storage boxes full of seeds are symbolically carried over the threshold.
Every seed carries its own story too. The Cherokee Nation is becoming the first indigenous American tribe to make a deposit. Their samples centre on the ‘three sisters’ crops – maize, squash and beans – varieties of which all predate European settlement. The majority of Cherokee communities today are in Oklahoma, where the corn can grow as high as an elephant’s eye, but the region is also prone to droughts, floods and tornadoes putting crops – and Cherokee heritage – at risk.
Many around the world are threatened by food insecurity, whether they live in areas affected by climate change or depend on a single, potentially vulnerable, crop.
The president of Ghana, Nana Akufo-Addo, an advocate of the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals, has also travelled to Svalbard. At the summit earlier in the day he spoke of the precarious position many nations find themselves in: “We know that climate change has a significant impact on agriculture around the world. In my own country, where we are getting recurrent droughts and floods, the threat to traditional agriculture is real.”
Ghana is not an isolated case. Seventy per cent of Myanmar’s population, 80 per cent of Mali’s and 90 per cent of Burundi’s depend on agriculture to make a living, so researchers from these countries are depositing varieties of their most resilient crops. More than half the world’s population – around three billion people – rely on rice for 80 per cent of their dietary intake, so the International Rice Research Institute based in the Philippines has created test boxes of different varieties of rice that will be stored in Svalbard for between 10 and 40 years to test how well they’ll germinate in the future. Gene banks from India and Morocco are focussing on seeds that could prove crucial in the increasingly dry tropics, home to two billion people, 664 million of them impoverished and relying on the land.
The Global Seed Vault might seem like excessive preparation against scenarios that might never come to pass, but its collections have already proved vital. The seed collection of the International Centre for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA) includes 80,000 samples stored in Svalbard, including many plants extinct in their natural habitats. Like other gene banks, the seeds in the Vault were simply a back-up. Unfortunately, ICARDA’s own storage facility was located in Aleppo and lost during the Syrian conflict in 2012.
“The government army captured the ICARDA premises in Syria,” Ahmed Amri of ICARDA says. “We do not know in which state the gene bank is now.
“The ICARDA gene bank in Aleppo held 141,052 accessions. In 2008, we started sending seed duplicates to Svalbard. Now, we have retrieved all duplicate seed samples stored and are regenerating about 30,000 of them each year.”
In five years ICARDA has already managed to take around 81,000 seed samples from its new bases in Morocco and Lebanon and redeposit them back in Svalbard.
Dr Chris Cockel from the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew is one of the representatives from the UK. Kew has its own storage facility, with even more seeds stored in the Millennium Seed Bank in Sussex than there are in Svalbard. But, as Cockel points out: “The important thing is not to put all your seeds in one basket.”
Although it couldn’t be revealed until the seeds were safely in Svalbard, the team from Kew branch has a special mission, here on his majesty’s secret service.
“We’re basically acting as the middle person between Svalbard and the Prince of Wales’ estate,” Cockel divulges.
Kew’s package contains 27 wild plant species from meadows at the Royal Gardens at Highgrove. His royal horticulturist said in a statement: “I am delighted that seeds from the wildflower meadows at Highgrove are to be safely stored in the Svalbard Global Seed Vault… It’s more urgent than ever that we act now to protect this diversity before it really is too late. Therefore the Seed Vault and seed banks around the world play a vital role in this critically important mission.”
What Prince Charles said to the plants themselves we don’t know.
Dr Chris Cockel leads a project at Kew studying how agriculture can adapt to climate change, drawing upon the wild relatives of 29 of the most critical food crops, from alfalfa to wheat.
“The material we’re getting from the Prince of Wales is in line with that,” Cockel says. “While they may not appear to be important for global food security, there are some species there, for instance wild carrot, that can be used in breeding programmes to make crops better at adapting to climate change and resist pests and diseases.”
Instead of the Svalbard Global Seed Vault being an insurance policy against Armageddon, Cockel says it’s more about preserving life and food as we know it. As well as storing seeds, gene banks around the world send samples to each other to further the research and ensure food security.
It’s more urgent than ever that we act now to protect this diversity before it really is too late
“The idea is to restore some of those important genetics that have been lost in the process of domestication. It’s not producing anything that’s genetically modified, it’s just using breeding methods that people have used for thousands of years to improve their crops.
“Previously most of the effort was put into producing high-yielding varieties and feeding more people. But that process has actually resulted in some of the crops becoming more vulnerable to pests and diseases as their genetic make-up has become narrower and narrower.
“Their wild relatives have survived, overlooked and often thought of as weeds. We’re not producing new super foods, but carrots that in 20 years’ time will look the same as carrots we have now. They might just be better adapted to a drier climate.”
So whether sudden global catastrophe or the worsening climate crisis comes to threaten all life on this planet, at least we know where to go to sow the seeds of recovery. . ",False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False
loc,https://www.loc.gov/law/help/oil-spill-liability/norway.php ,"Back to Oil Spill Liability and Regulatory Regime
I. Background
Oil production on the Norwegian continental shelf began on June 15, 1971, at the Ekofisk field, which is still one of the largest among Norway’s oil producing areas and whose production is expected to continue until 2050. It is estimated that only 35% of the country’s continental shelf resources have been exploited thus far. The petroleum industry, the largest Norwegian industrial sector, accounted for 26% of added value in Norway in 2006. That year, Norway ranked as the world’s fifth largest oil exporter, the tenth largest oil producer, the third largest gas exporter, and the fifth largest gas producer.[1] In 2008, it was the sixth largest net oil exporter and the eleventh top oil producer, and it remains the largest oil producer in Europe.[2]
As of January 2008, Norway’s continental shelf had seen one major oil blowout from a facility during the operations phase of petroleum extraction: the 1977 Ekofisk Bravo accident, which resulted from the failure of a bottom valve in a production well in connection with an overhaul.[3] Although there were no deaths from the accident, 9,000 tons of oil in one week spilled into the sea before operators regained control of the well.[4]
II. Legal Regime
A. Constitution
The Norwegian Constitution has provisions on general protection of the environment and natural resources. It states in Article 110b that every person has a right to an environment conducive to good health and “to a natural environment whose productivity and diversity are maintained. Natural resources should be managed on the basis of comprehensive long-term considerations whereby this right will be safeguarded for future generations as well” (para. 1). To safeguard this right, “citizens are entitled to information on the state of the natural environment and on the effects of any encroachment on nature that is planned or carried out” (para. 2). State authorities are to issue specific provisions for implementation of these principles (para. 3).[5]
B. Pollution Control Act
The Norway Pollution Control Act[6] (PCA) stipulates in general under Article 2, on guidelines, that efforts are to be made to prevent any occurrence or increase of pollution and to limit any pollution that does occur (item 1); that the costs of preventing or limiting pollution are to be met by the person responsible for the pollution (item 5); and that pollution resulting from activities in Norwegian territory will be counteracted to the same extent, irrespective of whether the damage arises within or outside Norway. The PCA defines pollution as, among other things, “the introduction of solids, liquids or gases to air, water or ground” and “anything that may aggravate the damage or nuisance caused by earlier pollution, or that together with environmental impacts such as [those listed above] causes or may cause damage or nuisance to the environment” (art. 6).
The PCA imposes a duty to avoid pollution, whereby, for example,
If there is a danger of pollution contrary to this Act or decisions made pursuant thereto, the person responsible for the pollution shall ensure that measures are taken to prevent such pollution from occurring. If pollution has already occurred, the said person shall ensure that measures are taken to stop or remove the pollution or limit its effects. The person responsible also has a duty to take steps to mitigate any damage or nuisance resulting from the pollution or from measures to counteract it. The duty laid down in this paragraph applies to measures that are in reasonable proportion to the damage and nuisance to be avoided. (art. 7, para. 2.)
However, such provisions do not apply to measures to prevent or stop acute pollution (art. 4, para. 1).
Special rules apply to liability for pollution damage, the scope of which is covered in Article 53 of the PCA, under Chapter 8, “Compensation for Pollution Damage.” Chapter 8 is applicable “insofar as the question of liability is not separately regulated by other legislation or a contract.” (art. 53, para. 1). Because the Petroleum Activities Act (see below) covers liability for such activities in the Norwegian realm, it seems that the PCA’s liability provisions do not apply to those activities.
C. Petroleum Activities Act
The Petroleum Activities Act[7] (Nov. 1996, No. 72) (PAA) is the key item of legislation applicable to oil spill liability. It “applies to petroleum activities in connection with subsea petroleum deposits under Norwegian jurisdiction” and “to petroleum activities inside and outside the realm and the Norwegian continental shelf to the extent such application follows from international law or from agreement with a foreign state”(art. 1-4, para. 1). It is also applicable to utilization of petroleum production on Norwegian land territory or seabed subject to private property rights, when that utilization “is necessary to or constitutes an integrated part of production or transportation of petroleum” (art. 1-4, para. 2). The King has the authority to issue regulations to supplement or delimit this condition of utilization (art. 1-4, para. 7). The PAA applies as well to a pipeline in Norwegian territorial jurisdiction that originates outside it should the King decide, insofar as it follows from international law, to apply relevant provisions of the PAA to the pipeline and associated equipment (art. 1-4, para. 3). The PAA does not apply to the internal waters and territorial sea of the Svalbard Islands (art. 1-4, para. 5).
1. Liability for Damage for Pollution in General Under the PAA
Provisions in Chapter 7 of the PAA apply to liability for damage from pollution and for damage arising as a result of pollution and waste (art. 1-4, para. 6). Pollution damage under the PAA refers to “damage or loss caused by pollution as a consequence of effluence or discharge of petroleum from a facility, including a well, and costs of reasonable measures to avert or limit such damage or such loss, as well as damage or loss as a consequence of such measures” and “[d]amage or loss incurred by fishermen as a consequence of reduced possibilities for fishing … .” (art. 7-1, para. 1). Ships used for stationary drilling are deemed a facility; ships that store petroleum in conjunction with production facilities are regarded as part of the facility, as are ships for transport of petroleum when loading from the facility occurs (art. 7-1, para. 2).
Chapter 7 provisions apply to such pollution damage that takes place “in Norway or inside the outer limits of the Norwegian continental shelf or affects a Norwegian vessel, Norwegian hunting or catching equipment or Norwegian facility in adjacent sea areas” (art. 7-2, para. 1). The provisions also apply when that damage occurs in onshore or offshore territory belonging to a party to the Nordic Environmental Protection Convention (art. 7-2, para. 2).[8] The King has the authority, irrespective of the PAA provisions, to issue rules on pollution damage liability by agreement with a foreign state, but the rules may not restrict the right to compensation based on the PAA in regard to any injured party under Norwegian jurisdiction (art. 7-2, para. 3).
In general, the PAA imposes strict liability for pollution damage on the licensee; licensee liability provisions also apply to an operator who is not a licensee subject to a Ministry of Petroleum and Energy decision in connection with the operator status approval (art. 7-3, para. 1). The PAA does not impose a liability cap for offshore drilling. If a license covers several licensees, one of which is the operator, the compensation claims will be initially directed to the operator. If the operator leaves any part of the compensation unpaid on the due date, that part is to be covered by the licensees proportionate to their participating interest in the license; if one fails to cover his share, it is to be allocated proportionately among the others (art. 7-3, para. 2). Liability may be reduced “to the extent it is reasonable” in cases of a force majeure demonstrably contributing “to a considerable degree to the damage or its extent,” beyond the liable party’s control. Particular consideration in such circumstances is given “to the scope of the activity, the situation of the party that has sustained damage and the opportunity for taking out insurance on both sides” (art. 7-3, para. 3). If pollution damage is from a facility in an area outside the Norwegian continental shelf, the party who has the competent authority’s approval to conduct facility-related activities will be deemed a licensee (art. 7-3, para. 4).
As for the channeling of liability of a licensee, it may only be claimed pursuant to the PAA’s provisions, and cannot be claimed against certain other specified actors, e.g., anyone who has performed tasks or worked in connection with the petroleum activities by agreement with a licensee or his contractors or anyone employed by a licensee (art. 7-4, paras. 1&2). If the licensee has been ordered to pay compensation but fails to pay it within the time limit stipulated by the judgment, the damaged party may bring action against the perpetrator of the damage, to the same extent as the licensee may bring action for recourse against the perpetrator; a similar rule applies to a licensee claiming compensation from the party that caused him pollution damage (art. 7-4, paras. 3&4).
The PAA does not permit a licensee to claim recourse for damage that is exempt from liability under the liability channeling provisions, except in cases where the person “or someone in his service has acted wilfully or by gross negligence” (art. 7-5, para. 1). Moreover, recourse liability may be mitigated to the extent “considered reasonable” on the basis of conduct, economic ability, and the general circumstances (art. 7-5, para. 2). To the extent recourse is claimed against a person entitled to limitation of liability under the rules of the Maritime Act of June 24, 1994, the relevant provisions of that Act will apply (art. 7-5, para. 3).[9]
Where pollution damage occurs in connection with petroleum activities conducted without a license, the party that carried out such activities, as well as others who took part and who knew, or should have known, that they were conducted without a license, will be liable for the damage regardless of fault (art. 7-6).
The operator is obliged under the PAA, “unless the Ministry considers it obviously unnecessary,” to provide “without undue delay,” by means of public announcement, information on the party to whom the compensation claims will be directed and the period of limitation (art. 7-7, para. 1). The announcement is to be made by placement of an advertisement twice, with at least one week’s interval, in The Norwegian Gazette (Norsk Lysingsblad) and in newspapers and other publications generally read in the places where the damage is caused or presumed to occur (art. 7-7, para. 2). The PAA also provides for the summoning by preclusive notice of possible claimants, subject to the Ministry’s consent and its issuance of relevant rules (art. 7-7, para. 3).
The legal venue for compensation for pollution damage is the court in the court district where the petroleum effluence or discharge has occurred or where the damage has been caused. However, the Ministry will determine where the legal action will be brought if: (a) the effluence or discharge occurred or the damage has been caused outside the area of any court district; (b) it cannot be demonstrated within which court district the effluence or discharge took place or the damage has been caused; (c) the effluence or discharge took place in one court district and the damage has been caused in another; or (d) the damage has been caused in more than one court district (art. 7-8, paras. 1 & 2).
2. Compensation for Norwegian Fishermen Under the PAA
Chapter 8 of the PAA is devoted to compensation for Norwegian fishermen (persons registered in the registration list of fishermen and owners of vessels listed in the registry of Norwegian fishing vessels subject to registration licenses (art. 8, para. 3)) for pollution damage. Chapter 8 provisions apply to compensation for financial losses incurred by Norwegian fishermen as a result of petroleum activities occurring in fishing fields or resulting in pollution and waste, or as a result of damage caused by a facility or actions in connection with the placement of a facility. They do not apply to pollution damage set forth under Article 7-1 (see above) (art. 8-1, para. 1). “Pollution and waste” in Chapter 8 (art. 8-1, para. 2) have the same definition as in Articles 6 and 27 of the PCA.
If petroleum activities completely or partially occupy a fishing field, the State must, “to the extent that fishing becomes impossible or is substantially impeded,” award compensation, in the form of payment entirely or in part as a lump sum or as a fixed annual payment, for any resultant financial losses. Compensation claims may normally not be made for losses that have occurred more than seven years after the occupation occurred. If the licensee should have averted the losses, the State may claim recovery from him (art. 8-2, paras. 1-3).
In general, the PAA imposes strict liability for financial losses incurred as a result of pollution and waste from the petroleum activities as well as for the cost of “reasonable measures to avert or limit such damage or such loss, including damage or loss as a result of such measures” (art. 8-3, para. 1). The liability also includes damage and inconvenience caused by pollution and waste from supply vessel and support vessel traffic, and by relocation of the facility to or from the field concerned. However, the licensee has the right of recourse against the actual perpetrator of the loss or the ship owner if the other prevailing conditions of liability have been fulfilled (art. 8-3, para. 2).
Compensation may also be claimed for fishing time lost to locating, marking, retrieving, or bringing ashore objects, provided the objects are “properly marked or brought ashore and presented to the police or port authority or other equivalent public authority, unless absolute obstacles exist”; the objects’ location, at least, must be reported to the police or port authority (art. 8-3, para. 3). This provision also applies to compensation for other losses “reasonably” requiring marking, indication of location, or bringing ashore of objects (art. 8-3, para. 4). Joint and several liability will be imposed on licensees for damage incurred when the perpetrator cannot be determined, to the extent that it is believed to have been caused by petroleum activities connected to the license in question (art. 8-4).
Strict liability of licensees also applies to financial losses suffered by fishermen as a result of damage caused by the placement of a facility or actions in connection with it, and the injured party does not have a right to compensation under the provisions of Article 8-2 (art. 8-5.)
Compensation claims made in connection with Norwegian fishermen will be handled by a commission, the composition and procedures of which will be determined by regulations issued by the King, who will also issue provisions on the handling of administrative appeals (art. 8-6, para. 1). Decisions of the administrative appeal body may be brought directly before the district court within two months of the party concerned having been notified by a summons of the given decision (art. 8-6, para. 2).
3. Penal Provisions Under the PAA
The PAA stipulates a punishment of a fine or up to three months’ imprisonment for willful or negligent violation of provisions or decisions issued in or pursuant to the Act; in particularly aggravated circumstances, a sentence of up to two years’ imprisonment may be imposed. The same penalties apply to complicit acts. These provisions will not apply, however, if the violation is subject to a more severe penalty under any other statutory provision (art. 10-17).
4. Proof of Insurance Under the Regulations to the PAA and JV Contracts
Proof of insurance is required by Norway for offshore drilling. There is no set amount for the insurance, but the Regulations to the Petroleum Activities Act stipulate that “the license shall provide reasonable insurance cover” (art. 73, para. 3).[10] Article 73 states in full:
The activities conducted by the licensee pursuant to the Act Chapters 3 and 4 [on production licenses and production of petroleum, respectively] shall be insured at all times. The insurance must at least cover:
- a) damage to facilities,
- b) pollution damage and other liability towards third parties,
- c) wreck removal and cleanup as a result of accidents,
- d) insurance of the licensee’s own employees who are engaged in the activities.
The licensee shall ensure that contractors and subcontractors engaged in the activities take out insurance for their employees to the same extent as the operator insures his own employees.
When taking out insurance as mentioned in the first paragraph literas a) to c), the licensee shall provide reasonable insurance cover, taking into consideration risk exposure and premium costs. Insurance as mentioned under litera d) shall be taken out as further agreed with the organisations of the employees.
The Ministry may consent to the licensee using another form of security arrangement.
At the end of each calendar year, the licensee shall inform the Ministry about existing insurance agreements, with an indication of the main terms. The Ministry may require further insurance to be taken out.
However, it is rare in Norway for there only to be one company in a lease, and leases are not award based on an auction system like that of the United States. Companies must apply for the leases and the Norwegian authorities will evaluate the applications based on such factors as the candidate’s geological expertise, the candidate’s technical expertise (including safety), and the authorities’ prior experience with the company. Therefore, most leases for petroleum activities are in the form of a joint venture. Article 14 of the standard joint venture agreement in Norway is on insurance.[11] It provides that the operator will take out and maintain any insurance required by laws, regulations, and other official rulings, as well as other insurance as determined by the management committee. Copies of the policies will be submitted to the joint venture parties (art. 14.1, para. 1). The operator must file all claims covered by the insurance and collect indemnities that are to be credited to the joint account (art. 14.1, para. 2, in part). A party to a joint venture is also entitled to take out his own insurance or an equivalent form of coverage, but must notify the operator well in advance of the operator’s taking out insurance on behalf of the joint venture, provide the operator and the other parties with the necessary information on that insurance coverage, and ensure waiver of recourse against the other parties (art. 14.2, para. 1). The operator must establish that the insurer of the parties covered by joint insurance or equivalent coverage taken out by the operator has waived recourse claims against a party that takes out his own insurance (art. 14.3). The operator must also ensure that suppliers of goods and services to the joint venture activities take out and maintain the requisite insurance (art. 14.4, in part).[12]
D. Other Potentially Relevant Regulations
Regulations Relating to Health, Environment and Safety in the Petroleum Activities (The Framework Regulations) contain provisions on, among other subjects, prudent petroleum activities, principles on risk reduction, coordination of and cooperation in emergency preparedness, establishment of safety zones, and sanctions.[13] An Appendix to the Regulations is on the “Application of the Working Environment Act in Petroleum Activities Outside the Norwegian Part of the Continental Shelf and During Relocation.”
There are four supplementary regulations to the Framework Regulations: Regulations on Management in Petroleum Activities (the Management Regulations),[14] Regulations on Material and Information in Petroleum Activities (Information Duty Regulations),[15] Regulations on the Design and Outfitting of Facilities, etc., in Petroleum Activities (Facilities Regulations),[16] and Regulations on the Conduct of Activities in Petroleum Activities (Activities Regulations).[17] The Management Regulations contain “all overarching requirements” for management in the field of health, safety, and the environment, including, inter alia, risk reduction, analysis and measurement, follow-up, and improvement.[18] The Information Duty Regulations set requirements for the relevant material and information to be submitted or made available to the authorities, such as applications for consent, alerts, notifications, and reporting. The Facilities Regulations govern the design and outfitting of facilities, “such as safety functions and loads, materials, work areas and accommodation areas, physical barriers and emergency preparedness.”[19] The Activities Regulations regulate various activities and set requirements for such matters as “planning, prerequisites for use, the working environment, work arrangements, health-related aspects, the external environment, maintenance and emergency preparedness. Requirements to environmental monitoring are listed in an appendix, which forms part of the regulations.”[20]
III. Key Regulatory Agencies
Norway’s Ministry of Petroleum and Energy (MPE) has as its principal aim the attainment of “a coordinated and integrated energy policy.”[21] The MPE is responsible for the state’s direct financial interest (SDFI), by means of which the state takes part in Norway’s petroleum sector as a direct investor. It is also in charge of state shareholding in StatoilHydro ASA (an oil and gas company in which the Norwegian state is the majority shareholder), Petoro AS (a state-owned limited company that manages SDFI and that serves as the licensee for SDFI shares on Norway’s continental shelf), and Gassco AS (a gas transport company). The MPE is responsible as well for the Government Petroleum Insurance Fund.[22]
The Norwegian Petroleum Directorate (NPD), which reports to the Ministry of Petroleum and Energy, “sets frameworks, stipulates regulations and makes decisions in areas where it has been delegated authority.”[23] It is also “responsible for conducting metering audits and collecting fees from the petroleum industry” and, “[t]ogether with the MPE, … is responsible for the security of supplies. In addition, the NPD contributes administrative competence, mapping of resources and petroleum data administration for the development aid programme ‘Oil for Development.’ ”[24] The NPD is the coordinating regulatory body; the Norwegian Pollution Control Authority (SFT) and the Norwegian Board of Health are independent regulatory authorities.[25]
The Petroleum Safety Authority Norway (PSA) was established as an independent government regulatory agency in 2004, supplanting the safety department of the NPD.[26] According to its website, the PSA is “the regulatory authority for technical and operational safety, including emergency preparedness, and for the working environment,” whose “regulatory role covers all phases of the industry, from planning and design through construction and operation to possible ultimate removal.”[27] Its definition of “safety” is broad-ranging “and embraces three categories of loss—human life, health and welfare, the natural environment, and financial investment and operational regularity.”
The Norwegian Climate and Pollution Agency (CPA, established on January 18, 2010; formerly the Norwegian Pollution Control Authority, established in 1974) is a directorate under the Ministry of Environment tasked with implementing government policy on pollution. One of its functions is to exercise regulatory authority and carry out inspections, e.g., by managing and enforcing the Pollution Control Act, the Product Control Act, and the Greenhouse Gas Emission Trading Act. The CPA grants permits, establishes requirements and sets emission limits, and carries out inspections to ensure compliance.[28]
IV. Regulations on Svalbard Islands
Norway also has a set of regulations relating to safe practices in petroleum exploration activities on the Svalbard Islands, entitled Regulations Relating to Safe Practice in Exploration and Exploration Drilling for Petroleum Deposits on Svalbard[29] (hereinafter, Svalbard Safety Regulations). As noted above, the PAA does not apply to the internal waters and territorial sea of the Islands. The Svalbard Islands are an archipelago, constituting the northernmost part of Norway, located about halfway between Norway’s mainland and the North Pole, in between the Norwegian Sea, Greenland Sea, Barents Sea, and Arctic Ocean.[30]
The Svalbard Safety Regulations “are applicable to safety in connection with exploration, exploration drilling for petroleum deposits or other exploration activities in accordance with The Mining Ordinance for Svalbard (Spitzbergen)” (art. 2, para. 1). The Petroleum Safety Authority of Norway is the main regulatory body referred to in the Svalbard Regulations (art. 2, para. 2). It has the authority to impose coercive fines on licensees who fail to comply with orders within the time limit imposed. Such fines must either be stipulated at the time the order is imposed, or in connection with the stipulation of a new time limit for compliance with the order (art. 4, para. 1). The amount of the fine will be based on the importance of complying with the order and the estimated costs involved. Coercive fines may be collected by distraint (art. 4, para. 2). When “considered reasonable,” the PSA may waive an imposed coercive fine (art. 4, para. 3).
Willful or negligent violation of the Svalbard Safety Regulations, or of regulations imposed by virtue of them, is punishable by fines, with reference to Article 339, subsection 2, of the Penal Code, except when more severe penal provisions apply to the case. The same penalty applies to attempt and complicity (art. 5). Article 339, subsection 2 of the Penal Code imposes liability to fines for failure to give to a public authority any report or information required by law or for contravening any regulation issued by a public authority according to law and implying liability to a penalty.[31]
Before the commencement of petroleum activities as well as afterwards, the Petroleum Safety Authority may require the licensee to “provide financial security for fulfillment of the obligations he has undertaken, as well as for possible liability in connection with the activities” (art. 15).
V. Recent Developments
The Norwegian Oil Industry Association (OLF) has reportedly commissioned a report on the differences and similarities between Norwegian and U.S. regulations and procedures for petroleum activities, as a result of the Deepwater Horizon accident.[32] OLF is “a professional body and employer’s association for oil and supplier companies engaged in the field of exploration and production of oil and gas on the Norwegian Continental Shelf.”[33] The report is to be prepared by Det Norske Veritas (DNV), an international provider of services to manage risk, headquartered in Oslo.[34]
Another result of the Deepwater Horizon spill is that Norway has declared a moratorium on deepwater drilling. Minister of Petroleum and Energy Terje Riis-Johansen, stated that, in connection with its twenty-first licensing round currently underway, Norway “will not allow any deepwater oil and gas drilling in new areas until the investigation into the explosion and spill in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico is complete.”[35] He further stated that it would not be appropriate for him to allow new licenses for deepwater drilling “until we have good knowledge of what has happened with the Deepwater Horizon [the Gulf of Mexico rig that exploded on April 20] and what this means for our regulations.”[36]

Statkraft proposes using hydrogen as an energy carrier and starting point for producing electricity on Svalbard.
Energy solution: Renewable proposal for Svalbard
The island community of Svalbard, lying between Norway and the North Pole, currently receives its electricity from a coal power plant. But what happens when the coal is gone and Svalbard must become climate neutral? Statkraft proposes using renewable hydrogen produced from wind power in Finnmark and shipped by boat to Svalbard.
Bjørn Holsen is responsible for business development and heads the New Business unit in Statkraft's European Wind and Solar business area.
Svalbard's approximately 2,500 inhabitants make their living mainly from tourism, research and coal mining. The coal mines are now mostly shut down, which is a challenge for the both the economy of the archipelago and for its energy supply. Mine number 7 is still operating, supplying the power plant in the main town Longyearbyen with coal, but the coal reserves will be exhausted in a few years. What will Svalbard do then?
""The coal power plant could operate until 2038, but the coal reserves will only last until 2025. Unless Svalbard is to rely on imports of coal, it is urgent to find alternative solutions for the energy supply,"" says Bjørn Holsen, Director of Business Development in Statkraft.
""As Europe's largest supplier of renewable energy, we obviously think the solution should be renewable and sustainable. Looking forward towards 2050, a low-emission solution is not enough. We should aim for zero emissions.""
Few renewable proposals
In the summer of 2018, the Ministry of Petroleum and Energy (OED) received a report from a study it commissioned from Multiconsult and Thema Consulting Group entitled ""Alternatives for future energy supply for Svalbard"".
The report contains a number of proposals for future energy solutions, including a gas-fired power plant based on LNG, a thermal power plant based on pellets, and gas power combined with solar power. However, the consultants' report contains few proposals for renewable energy solutions for the Svalbard community. The exception is a proposal for a power cable from the mainland, a very expensive solution for such a small population.
""It's a challenge of course that Svalbard is an island community, with limited opportunities for local energy production. If you can't rely on local resources, like coal, it's logical to use energy carriers shipped from the mainland, such as gas and pellets. However, we believe that there are future-oriented renewable solutions that are not mentioned in the consultants' report and that OED should consider,"" says Holsen.
He also refers to the 2016 request from the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence in the Storting (the Norwegian parliament) that the government investigate a new environmentally friendly energy solution for Svalbard, in keeping with the overall goal to make Svalbard a climate-neutral society.
Surplus of wind
Statkraft's proposal, presented in a working paper from October 2018, focuses on using hydrogen as energy carrier and starting point for energy production in Svalbard. Hydrogen is completely pure and generates no CO2 emissions.
The best energy utilisation is achieved by using fuel cells in the local power plant. Producing hydrogen through electrolysis is energy-intensive, but with electricity from a wind farm it can still be profitable. In addition, such projects will help reduce costs related to the use of hydrogen-based technology. Nevertheless, no future solution will provide very low-cost energy on Svalbard.
""The proposal is to use wind power resources in Finnmark County to produce hydrogen. The idea comes from the working group Business and the Power Grid in the North (N3), where Avinor, Enova, Gassco, Petoro, Statnett, and Statkraft looked at opportunities for new business development in the north,"" says Holsen.
""This is of interest for Statkraft because the lack of grid capacity means that we cannot fully utilise energy resources in the north. The Finnmark coast may be suitable for further wind power development, and hydrogen production based on wind can also be an important contribution to new value creation in northern Norway.""
Hydrogen in ammonia
To determine the feasibility of the idea, Statkraft, along with experts from SINTEF Industri, looked at different ways to ""pack"" hydrogen for safe transport to Svalbard. One solution looks most promising.
""The solution we believe is safest and most cost-effective involves binding hydrogen in ammonia (NH3). Ammonia is produced from nitrogen from air and hydrogen from electrolysis. This mix has a high energy density, in fact higher than liquid hydrogen, and is also easier to handle,"" explains Holsen. In Svalbard, ammonia can be used directly in a fuel cell or in a gas turbine to produce electricity and heat.
""Usually it's not a very good solution to use electricity to produce hydrogen, which in turn is used to produce electricity, but if you want both electricity and heat, then fuel cells are a good option. At the same time, there are no other alternatives that will result in lower cost or lower energy loss,"" says Holsen.
Requests a review
Bjørn Holsen hopes OED will consider Statkraft's proposal in the assessment of a future energy solution for Svalbard, especially if the solution is to be sustainable and carbon-free.
""In addition to providing Svalbard with an effective energy solution, hydrogen production in Finnmark can be an important part of a new maritime value chain in the north,"" he says.
""Shipping traffic also has to go through the green shift, and then fuel cells are a relevant fuel solution. Plants in Finnmark can thus become suppliers of fuel to shipping and a new renewable energy industry, with export potential to the rest of Europe.""
Statkraft's proposal for a renewable energy supply to Svalbard is available as a preliminary analysis, and more thorough work must be done to determine costs more precisely.

- Svalbard is the collective name for an archipelago halfway between mainland Norway and the North Pole.
- Svalbard became part of the Kingdom of Norway through the Svalbard Treaty of 1920, but also gained special international status. Citizens from all 43 countries that signed the Svalbard Treaty have the right to engage in business activities on the archipelago.
- There have been coal mining operations on Svalbard for more than 100 years, but with the phasing out of mining operations, much of the business activity in Svalbard will be associated with tourism, research and education.
Renewable energy solution for Svalbard
Statkraft's proposal focuses on using hydrogen as energy carrier and starting point for energy production in Svalbard. The proposal was presented to the Ministry of Petroleum and Energy (OED) on 9 November 2018.

Statkraft proposes using hydrogen as an energy carrier and starting point for producing electricity on Svalbard.
Energy solution: Renewable proposal for Svalbard
The island community of Svalbard, lying between Norway and the North Pole, currently receives its electricity from a coal power plant. But what happens when the coal is gone and Svalbard must become climate neutral? Statkraft proposes using renewable hydrogen produced from wind power in Finnmark and shipped by boat to Svalbard.
Bjørn Holsen is responsible for business development and heads the New Business unit in Statkraft's European Wind and Solar business area.
Svalbard's approximately 2,500 inhabitants make their living mainly from tourism, research and coal mining. The coal mines are now mostly shut down, which is a challenge for the both the economy of the archipelago and for its energy supply. Mine number 7 is still operating, supplying the power plant in the main town Longyearbyen with coal, but the coal reserves will be exhausted in a few years. What will Svalbard do then?
""The coal power plant could operate until 2038, but the coal reserves will only last until 2025. Unless Svalbard is to rely on imports of coal, it is urgent to find alternative solutions for the energy supply,"" says Bjørn Holsen, Director of Business Development in Statkraft.
""As Europe's largest supplier of renewable energy, we obviously think the solution should be renewable and sustainable. Looking forward towards 2050, a low-emission solution is not enough. We should aim for zero emissions.""
Few renewable proposals
In the summer of 2018, the Ministry of Petroleum and Energy (OED) received a report from a study it commissioned from Multiconsult and Thema Consulting Group entitled ""Alternatives for future energy supply for Svalbard"".
The report contains a number of proposals for future energy solutions, including a gas-fired power plant based on LNG, a thermal power plant based on pellets, and gas power combined with solar power. However, the consultants' report contains few proposals for renewable energy solutions for the Svalbard community. The exception is a proposal for a power cable from the mainland, a very expensive solution for such a small population.
""It's a challenge of course that Svalbard is an island community, with limited opportunities for local energy production. If you can't rely on local resources, like coal, it's logical to use energy carriers shipped from the mainland, such as gas and pellets. However, we believe that there are future-oriented renewable solutions that are not mentioned in the consultants' report and that OED should consider,"" says Holsen.
He also refers to the 2016 request from the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence in the Storting (the Norwegian parliament) that the government investigate a new environmentally friendly energy solution for Svalbard, in keeping with the overall goal to make Svalbard a climate-neutral society.
Surplus of wind
Statkraft's proposal, presented in a working paper from October 2018, focuses on using hydrogen as energy carrier and starting point for energy production in Svalbard. Hydrogen is completely pure and generates no CO2 emissions.
The best energy utilisation is achieved by using fuel cells in the local power plant. Producing hydrogen through electrolysis is energy-intensive, but with electricity from a wind farm it can still be profitable. In addition, such projects will help reduce costs related to the use of hydrogen-based technology. Nevertheless, no future solution will provide very low-cost energy on Svalbard.
""The proposal is to use wind power resources in Finnmark County to produce hydrogen. The idea comes from the working group Business and the Power Grid in the North (N3), where Avinor, Enova, Gassco, Petoro, Statnett, and Statkraft looked at opportunities for new business development in the north,"" says Holsen.
""This is of interest for Statkraft because the lack of grid capacity means that we cannot fully utilise energy resources in the north. The Finnmark coast may be suitable for further wind power development, and hydrogen production based on wind can also be an important contribution to new value creation in northern Norway.""
Hydrogen in ammonia
To determine the feasibility of the idea, Statkraft, along with experts from SINTEF Industri, looked at different ways to ""pack"" hydrogen for safe transport to Svalbard. One solution looks most promising.
""The solution we believe is safest and most cost-effective involves binding hydrogen in ammonia (NH3). Ammonia is produced from nitrogen from air and hydrogen from electrolysis. This mix has a high energy density, in fact higher than liquid hydrogen, and is also easier to handle,"" explains Holsen. In Svalbard, ammonia can be used directly in a fuel cell or in a gas turbine to produce electricity and heat.
""Usually it's not a very good solution to use electricity to produce hydrogen, which in turn is used to produce electricity, but if you want both electricity and heat, then fuel cells are a good option. At the same time, there are no other alternatives that will result in lower cost or lower energy loss,"" says Holsen.
Requests a review
Bjørn Holsen hopes OED will consider Statkraft's proposal in the assessment of a future energy solution for Svalbard, especially if the solution is to be sustainable and carbon-free.
""In addition to providing Svalbard with an effective energy solution, hydrogen production in Finnmark can be an important part of a new maritime value chain in the north,"" he says.
""Shipping traffic also has to go through the green shift, and then fuel cells are a relevant fuel solution. Plants in Finnmark can thus become suppliers of fuel to shipping and a new renewable energy industry, with export potential to the rest of Europe.""
Statkraft's proposal for a renewable energy supply to Svalbard is available as a preliminary analysis, and more thorough work must be done to determine costs more precisely. However, the preliminary findings indicate that both alternatives, hydrogen bound in ammonia and compressed hydrogen, are competitive with the proposals presented in the Multiconsult and Thema report.

Apart from watermelon and pumpkin seeds, the deposit will include crop seeds from genebanks in Africa, Europe and South Asia
This week will mark the first time in 2021 when the Svalbard Global Seed Vault opens to deposit crop seeds to its existing collection. It’s bound to be a ‘sweet’ feeling as watermelon, strawberry and pumpkin seeds will be deposited at the Vault along with many other crop seed varieties from genebanks in Africa, Europe and South Asia.
The Seed Vault was last opened for a deposit in October 2020. The decision to add watermelon, strawberry and pumpkin seeds also coincides with the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)’s International Year of Fruits and Vegetables.
The Svalbard Global Seed Vault has often been dubbed as the “doomsday” vault. It is a secure facility located inside a mountain on a remote island in the Svalbard archipelago. Svalbard is a geologically stable area where humidity levels are also low. The Seed Vault is located well above sea level and protected from flooding. Apart from artificial cooling systems, the permafrost also offers natural freezing, providing a cost-effective and fail-safe method to conserve seeds.
Norway established and owns the Seed Vault, which is managed and operated through a partnership between the Norwegian ministry of agriculture and food, the Nordic Genetic Resource Centre, also known as NordGen, and the international organization Crop Trust.

In total, five genebanks are depositing almost 6,500 seed samples at the Seed Vault this week: AfricaRice in Côte d’Ivoire, ICRISAT (International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics) in India, the Julius Kühn-Institute (JKI) in Germany, SADC Plant Genetic Resources Centre in Zambia and the national genebank in Mali.
According to a blog post on the Crop Trust website, the Institute for Breeding Research on Fruit Crops, part of JKI in Germany, will be depositing a package of 500 Fragaria vesca (woodland or wild strawberry) seeds. “We welcome the deposits of new seeds of fruits, vegetables and other important food crops,"" Olaug Bollestad, Norwegian minister for agriculture and food, said in a press release. ""This diversity contributes to nutritious food and constitutes the building blocks for adapting food production to climate change. This deposit is thus a small, but significant step on our pathway to reach the Sustainable Development Goals.”
Today, the Seed Vault houses more than one million seed samples in total. These have been deposited by almost 90 genebanks over the past 13 years. Opened in 2008, the Seed Vault in Svalbard acts as a backup for genebanks around the world -- to conserve duplicates of their crop diversity.

In a worst-case scenario, if a genebank collection gets destroyed or becomes inaccessible due to war or extreme weather events, or if its collection is damaged due to a lack of sufficient funding or accident, the duplicate seeds will still be available for the depositor to retrieve from the Seed Vault and start afresh. Despite the ongoing covid-19 pandemic, the Seed Vault is scheduled to open two more times this year, in May and again in October.
In a 2018 interview with Mint, Åsmund Asdal, the Seed Vault’s coordinator, had explained why it is critical to preserve new varieties of crops and seeds. “Seeds do not live forever. Gene banks regularly monitor the viability of their seeds… We need these varieties because of climate change, increasing food production, dry and wet climate conditions, new plant diseases, and so on,” said Asdal, who described the Seed Vault in Svalbard as “quite a simple project in a big international system for improving agriculture.”

It’s not easy being a tiny willow on the wind-and snow-blasted islands of the Norwegian territory of Svalbard. It turns out that Salix polaris, the polar willow, handles these tough conditions by growing as best it can in response to July temperatures — a response that researchers recorded all over the archipelago.
The polar willow (Salix polaris) may not seem like much when you look at it — just a jumble of tiny green leaves in a dense mat that pokes out of the tundra.
But beyond its humble appearance, this little shrub plays an outsized role when it comes to the creatures living in the Arctic archipelago of Svalbard.
It’s not just that Svalbard’s reindeer depend on it for food. It’s also that how it grows reflects what happens with the growth of all other plants across the whole of Svalbard.
Now, researchers have found that the polar willow and other plants grow in synchrony across Svalbard, in direct response to July temperatures.
On beyond reindeer
Mathilde Le Moullec, a postdoc at NTNU’s Centre for Biodiversity Dynamics, has spent much of her academic career investigating all of the interlocking puzzle pieces that make the Svalbard plant and animal community work.
She’s searched for reindeer for four summers as a way to get a highly accurate population estimate for the animals. She’s hunted for old reindeer antlers and bones during those years, so she could carbon date them.
All of that information combined allowed her to see where on Svalbard the animals formerly lived, and how their populations had changed over time. She used all this information to document how Svalbard’s reindeer population rebounded after being hunted down to very low numbers for centuries.
But Le Moullec realized she needed to look beyond just reindeer to have a deeper understanding of the whole ecosystem.
“Salix is an important part of their main diet, especially because there is almost no lichen on Svalbard,” she said. One study found that lichen makes up just 2 per cent of the diets of Svalbard reindeer, she said.
By studying what controls the growth of the polar willow across Svalbard, “you can also see how climate is affecting primary production in different places,” meaning growth of things like plants, which are at the base of the food chain, she said. “It also gives you a window on what different reindeer populations have to eat.”
The sailboat summer
Another advantage of studying something like the polar willow is that “you can go to one place, one time, dig up a willow, and come back with 40 years or more of data,” she said.
So that’s what she did. In 2015, when two friends offered the use of their sailboat Sillage to help her reach some of Svalbard’s more remote locations to count reindeer, she and her friend Morgen Bender, a PhD candidate from UiT — The Arctic University of Norway also set about digging up polar willows.
Thirty of their plants came from Semmeldalen, in south central Svalbard. The advantage of Semmeldalen was that René van der Wal, a professor at the University of Aberdeen and Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, who worked with Le Moullec on other willow research, had established a long-term study of plants there starting in 1998.
But that was only the beginning.
Because then she and colleague Lisa Sandal, then a master’s student in the Department of Biology, had to count the microscopic growth rings in this miniature arctic shrub.
One field summer, two years in the lab
Even though some of the willows being studied were more than 40 years old — the oldest was 70 — the growth rings were teeny-tiny.
If this research never becomes science, we can sell it as art.
“The entire root is the thickness of the tip of a fork, it is just a few millimetres across,” Le Moullec said. “Each growth ring is just a few micrometres, so we cut cross sections that are a cell thickness of two micrometres.”
To put that in perspective, a strand of spider’s web silk is 3-8 micrometres in diameter.
The researchers also had to look at multiple cross sections from each plant.
That’s because some shrubs might not put on growth rings every year. Or the cross section might only have partial growth rings on one side that the researchers might not see, depending on where in the plant the cross section came from.
They put the cross sections under a powerful microscope and took photographs — as many as 70 for a cross section — so they could merge the pictures together to make a single stunningly beautiful photo with a great amount of detail.
“The lab part took almost two years,” Le Moullec said. “One person couldn’t do it alone. And with Lisa, we joked the whole time, if this research never becomes science, we can sell it as art. “
In fact, one of the images won the British Ecological Society’s 2018 Capturing Ecology photo competition in the Art of Ecology category.
“Fortunately, the art also became science!” Le Moullec said.
Correlating shrub growth across Svalbard
The shrub rings show distinctive patterns, year by year, based on how good or poor the growing conditions were. But the researchers wanted to know if one particular weather factor was more important than others in determining how well the plants would grow.
Certain years, called pointer years, are very good growth years for all plants. That makes the pointer year rings easy to find, making them like a time stamp in the rings of each willow. Using the pointer years enabled the researchers to figure out if some willows were missing growth years, or if the cross section they had might have had a ring that grew on only one side.
They needed to know this to know the year of formation for each growth ring for each shrub.
From there it was a matter of looking at weather data across Svalbard, and looking at five different weather-related factors to see which were best reflected in tree ring growth.
These factors were the onset of spring, amount of snowfall, rain-on-snow events, summer temperature and summer precipitation.
Of all these factors, July temperature was the most important for willows growing in all 8 sites. Yes, across a huge archipelago, July temperatures ruled for willow — and had an effect for all other vegetation there, causing vegetation to grow in lock-step. That also has significance for grazing animals, like reindeer.
A first for arctic shrubs
Researchers have seen this kind of synchronous pattern before, in boreal or temperate forests, where summer temperatures have a coordinating effect on tree growth across large areas. But this is the first time this kind of research has been done in the Arctic, Le Moullec said, and in a tree where the largest structure — the root — is half the size of your pinkie finger.
Le Moullec and her colleagues did find another factor that negatively affected willow growth in some areas, and that was rain-on-snow events. These are exactly what they sound like — a weather event where rain falls on snow, and then the plants become covered in a thick layer of ice which seals them away from the air and essentially smothers them until the ice melts away.
In earlier research, Le Moullec’s supervisor, Brage Bremset Hansen, documented how rain-on-snow events could cause widespread problems for reindeer populations, ultimately causing a ripple effect for the other species that overwinter on Svalbard.
More rain-on-snow could have mixed results
Researchers expect more rain-on-snow events on Svalbard as increasing climate change causes arctic temperatures to skyrocket.
As a result, the relative importance of seasons for growth patterns may change, Le Moullec said. Because the effect of rain-on-snow was so different in different parts of Svalbard, the synchronizing effect of July temperature on vegetation growth may be weakened over time, she said.
On one hand, that could be better for the overall health of the ecosystem, because when one area has a bad growth year, other areas may do fine. As a consequence, even though reindeer in areas with poor growth may have a hard time surviving, not all reindeer populations on the island will be equally affected.
On the other hand, if rain-on-snow become widespread all across Svalbard, all populations may have a hard time simultaneously.
Van der Wal, who has worked with Le Moullec although not on this study, said he was impressed by her “painstaking but elegant work.”
“We knew that warm summers allowed high arctic plants to grow well, but always believed that this was what happened above ground. For Mathilde to show that good years above ground also means good growth below ground, and for this to reflect the productivity of all higher plants together is a major step forward,” he said.

Oikos. doi:10.1111/oik.07059 . Found traces of antidepressants and painkillers in crustaceans on Svalbard
A team of researchers studying our footprint in the Arctic has taken samples of marine animals and wastewater linked to tourism. Their findings have revealed surprising levels of pharmaceutical drugs.
Researchers from SINTEF, the Norwegian Polar Institute and the University Centre in Svalbard have collected samples from Arctic crustaceans close to the settlement of Ny-Ålesund on the west coast of Spitsbergen. During the spring and summer, they discovered a number of drugs in a variety of different concentrations.
“These included ibuprofen from Ibux, diclofenac from Voltaren, antibiotics and an antidepressant,” says SINTEF researcher Ida Beathe Øverjordet.
The aim of the project is to study our footprint on the natural world – to measure how much material is discharged, and what significance this has. The results may have an impact on the way in which we manage the Arctic regions in the future.
“It’s easy to assume that this won’t be an issue because there are so few people living in this area. However, the fact is that we found many traces of drugs in the animals,” says Øverjordet.
Surprising discoveries
The first thing that the researchers noticed was the high levels of ibuprofen in all the animals.
“Ibux is a commonly used drug with quite a long lifetime in the environment compared with medications such as paracetamol, which often breaks down very rapidly. So this wasn’t such a surprising discovery,” says Øverjordet. “However, what did surprise us was that the concentrations of the drug were so high, considering that the area is so sparsely inhabited.”
Since crustaceans, such as copepods, occupy the lowest levels of the food pyramid, compounds in the drugs will be passed upwards to larger animals. Copepods constitute the basis for much of the life in the Arctic because they are rich in fats, and are thus essential to building and maintaining the fat reserves of Arctic fish and seabird species.
Similarly, finding traces of drugs such as antibiotics and diclofenac wasn’t so strange, since these medications are also in common use.
“Somewhat more surprising was that we discovered less commonly used drugs such as antidepressants,” says Øverjordet.
Only 30 permanent inhabitants
Ny-Ålesund is populated by service personnel and researchers from ten different countries. There are only 30 permanent inhabitants, but in summer, visiting researchers and seasonal workers can boost the population to as many as 200 people, all of whom are between the ages of 20 and 70, and are generally healthy and in good condition. There will also be some tourists visiting for short periods – the majority just for day trips.
“One of our next steps will be to find out what drugs are used in the area, and to compare the results with what we find in the local sewage and living organisms,” says Øverjordet. “We’re particularly interested in examining seasonal variations in order to get an idea of what medications are taken locally compared with what is brought in by the tourists who are only making short visits,” she says.
Same concentrations as in Tromsø
This study is part of a research project called PharmArctic, which is being funded by the flagship research programme Miljøgifter at the Fram Research Centre in Tromsø. The programme focuses on generating knowledge about the impacts of environmental toxins on Arctic ecosystems, and is looking into the links between the concentrations of pharmaceutical drugs and cosmetic products and discharges from settlements and tourism in the Arctic.
In an earlier study of sewage from the town of Longyearbyen, also on the west coast of Spitsbergen, it was shown that the concentrations of some drugs were equivalent to, or even higher than, those recorded for cities such as Tromsø, which has a much higher population.
The general lack of sewage decontamination due to permafrost and low temperatures is a constant problem in the Arctic, including on Svalbard.
“Only 2,500 people live in Longyearbyen, but each year, many thousands of tourists visit for long or short stays, all making their contribution to the substances that get discharged in the sewage,” says Øverjordet. “However, the main reason for the high concentrations is the lack of sewage decontamination in Longyearbyen. Everything is simply discharged straight into the fjord.”
The general lack of sewage decontamination due to permafrost and low temperatures is a constant problem in the Arctic, including on Svalbard.
Ny-Ålesund installed a very basic raw sewage decontamination system in 2018, and as part of their future work, researchers will be studying differences in drug concentrations in the samples collected before and after decontamination was introduced.
Impact on regulatory governance
The project’s findings may be used to influence the future management of the Arctic regions, as well as national and international regulatory governance, both on land and at sea.
“It’s true that cruise ships are not permitted to discharge their sewage close to land, but if the compounds have a long environmental lifetime, they may still cause problems,” Øverjordet explains.
At the moment, we know very little about the concentrations and levels of exposure that Arctic wildlife have to pharmaceutical drugs, and how big this problem really is.
Are pharmaceutical drugs hazardous to wildlife?
The crustaceans from which samples were taken are small planktonic organisms called copepods and amphipods, which live on the seabed and in the water column.
“These animals have different ways of life, which in turn influence the types of environmental toxins to which they are exposed and thus how much they ingest,” says Øverjordet. “Amphipods, for example, are benthic organisms that feed on carrion and other organic material that is deposited on the seabed, and may thus be exposed to more of the environmental toxins that accumulate there,” she says.
To date, the research team has not identified any drug concentrations as being hazardous to Arctic wildlife, though it has been shown that the drugs clearly are ingested.
“Since these crustaceans occupy the lowest levels of the food pyramid, compounds in the drugs will be passed upwards to larger animals,” says Øverjordet. “Copepods constitute the basis for much of the life in the Arctic because they are rich in fats and are thus essential to building and maintaining the fat reserves of Arctic fish and seabird species.”
The drugs in question may impact wildlife in a number of ways. Various other studies have shown that antidepressants alter the behaviour of zooplankton and fish, and that this may have an impact on their survival, as well as a number of other effects.
“We don’t know what the tolerance levels are for Arctic wildlife species,” says Øverjordet. “This is something we will be studying in the future.”
Too little data and knowledge
In the future, the researchers will be analysing the sewage samples from Longyearbyen and Ny-Ålesund that were collected at intervals during the summer of 2020.
“Samples of both sewage and seawater have been taken to measure the concentrations of drugs in the water,” says Øverjordet. “The sewage samples will give us an indication of how much is discharged from the settlements during a given season. We have very little data on Arctic wildlife species, so we’re hoping that the results from our initial project will provide a basis for more research in this area,” she says.
The researchers have applied to expand their studies both on Svalbard and in Greenland. . A tiny arctic shrub reveals secrets of plant growth on Svalbard
It’s not easy being a tiny willow on the wind-and snow-blasted islands of the Norwegian territory of Svalbard. It turns out that Salix polaris, the polar willow, handles these tough conditions by growing as best it can in response to July temperatures — a response that researchers recorded all over the archipelago.
The polar willow (Salix polaris) may not seem like much when you look at it — just a jumble of tiny green leaves in a dense mat that pokes out of the tundra.
But beyond its humble appearance, this little shrub plays an outsized role when it comes to the creatures living in the Arctic archipelago of Svalbard.
It’s not just that Svalbard’s reindeer depend on it for food. It’s also that how it grows reflects what happens with the growth of all other plants across the whole of Svalbard.
Now, researchers have found that the polar willow and other plants grow in synchrony across Svalbard, in direct response to July temperatures.
On beyond reindeer
Mathilde Le Moullec, a postdoc at NTNU’s Centre for Biodiversity Dynamics, has spent much of her academic career investigating all of the interlocking puzzle pieces that make the Svalbard plant and animal community work.
She’s searched for reindeer for four summers as a way to get a highly accurate population estimate for the animals. She’s hunted for old reindeer antlers and bones during those years, so she could carbon date them.
All of that information combined allowed her to see where on Svalbard the animals formerly lived, and how their populations had changed over time. She used all this information to document how Svalbard’s reindeer population rebounded after being hunted down to very low numbers for centuries.
But Le Moullec realized she needed to look beyond just reindeer to have a deeper understanding of the whole ecosystem.
“Salix is an important part of their main diet, especially because there is almost no lichen on Svalbard,” she said. One study found that lichen makes up just 2 per cent of the diets of Svalbard reindeer, she said.
By studying what controls the growth of the polar willow across Svalbard, “you can also see how climate is affecting primary production in different places,” meaning growth of things like plants, which are at the base of the food chain, she said. “It also gives you a window on what different reindeer populations have to eat.”
The sailboat summer
Another advantage of studying something like the polar willow is that “you can go to one place, one time, dig up a willow, and come back with 40 years or more of data,” she said.
So that’s what she did. In 2015, when two friends offered the use of their sailboat Sillage to help her reach some of Svalbard’s more remote locations to count reindeer, she and her friend Morgen Bender, a PhD candidate from UiT — The Arctic University of Norway also set about digging up polar willows.
Thirty of their plants came from Semmeldalen, in south central Svalbard. The advantage of Semmeldalen was that René van der Wal, a professor at the University of Aberdeen and Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, who worked with Le Moullec on other willow research, had established a long-term study of plants there starting in 1998.
But that was only the beginning.
Because then she and colleague Lisa Sandal, then a master’s student in the Department of Biology, had to count the microscopic growth rings in this miniature arctic shrub.
One field summer, two years in the lab
Even though some of the willows being studied were more than 40 years old — the oldest was 70 — the growth rings were teeny-tiny.
If this research never becomes science, we can sell it as art.
“The entire root is the thickness of the tip of a fork, it is just a few millimetres across,” Le Moullec said. “Each growth ring is just a few micrometres, so we cut cross sections that are a cell thickness of two micrometres.”
To put that in perspective, a strand of spider’s web silk is 3-8 micrometres in diameter.
The researchers also had to look at multiple cross sections from each plant.
That’s because some shrubs might not put on growth rings every year. Or the cross section might only have partial growth rings on one side that the researchers might not see, depending on where in the plant the cross section came from.
They put the cross sections under a powerful microscope and took photographs — as many as 70 for a cross section — so they could merge the pictures together to make a single stunningly beautiful photo with a great amount of detail.
“The lab part took almost two years,” Le Moullec said. “One person couldn’t do it alone. And with Lisa, we joked the whole time, if this research never becomes science, we can sell it as art. “
In fact, one of the images won the British Ecological Society’s 2018 Capturing Ecology photo competition in the Art of Ecology category.
“Fortunately, the art also became science!” Le Moullec said.
Correlating shrub growth across Svalbard
The shrub rings show distinctive patterns, year by year, based on how good or poor the growing conditions were. But the researchers wanted to know if one particular weather factor was more important than others in determining how well the plants would grow.
Certain years, called pointer years, are very good growth years for all plants. That makes the pointer year rings easy to find, making them like a time stamp in the rings of each willow. Using the pointer years enabled the researchers to figure out if some willows were missing growth years, or if the cross section they had might have had a ring that grew on only one side.
They needed to know this to know the year of formation for each growth ring for each shrub.
From there it was a matter of looking at weather data across Svalbard, and looking at five different weather-related factors to see which were best reflected in tree ring growth.

osce,https://www.osce.org/parliamentary-assembly/420599 ,"In visit to Arctic region, OSCE PA leadership explores local and global impact of climate change
LONGYEARBYEN23 May 2019
LONGYEARBYEN, 23 May 2019 – The concrete impact of global warming and the changing nature of the Arctic region are the focus of an OSCE PA visit hosted by the Norwegian parliament this week. In Svalbard, one of the world’s northernmost inhabited areas, OSCE parliamentarians explored new local realities in the High North and considered how climate change poses security risks for the entire OSCE region.
The PA delegation included President George Tsereteli (Georgia), Second Committee Chair Nilza de Sena (Portugal) and Rapporteur Elona Gjebrea Hoxha (Albania), and Secretary General Roberto Montella (Italy). It was joined north of the Arctic Circle by the Delegation of Norway to the OSCE PA.
In a series of seminars and field visits in Tromsø and Svalbard, Members were sensitized to the severe disruptions to the Arctic environment caused by a rise of temperatures in the region.
“The Arctic is warming up twice as fast any other region in the world, and in just one generation we have been able to note critical alterations to the local fauna and flora. Here in Svalbard, we can clearly observe how Arctic livelihoods are being impacted,” said Norwegian Head of Delegation Siv Mossleth.
OSCE parliamentarians also discussed ways to mitigate and adapt to climate change in the High North with local authorities.
“This visit is important for us to better understand the concerns emerging from Norway and other Arctic countries, and we can find inspiration in their close co-operation to promote sustainable development and protect biodiversity,” said President George Tsereteli. “As a forum of 57 countries covering the Northern Hemisphere, the OSCE PA is ideally suited to encourage discussions on these new threats and to promote a deeper involvement of parliamentarians in the fight against climate change.”
The visit illustrated the importance of monitoring variations in the Arctic ecosystem, and of understanding the ripple effect of changes in the Arctic climate.
“The Svalbard archipelago is one of the most sensitive areas to global warming, and the tangible impact on the Arctic environment and ecosystem we witness here causes disruptions at a larger scale in the rest of the world,” said the Chair of the OSCE PA’s economic and environmental committee, Nilza de Sena. “While few live in the Arctic region, the risks associated with climate-related disasters have become a reality for more and more people on the globe. This compels us to act with urgency to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change.”
Throughout the visit, participants were briefed on Arctic exploration, satellite observation, and other environmental research efforts undertaken to understand climate change and its impact on the Arctic region. Experts and scientists underlined the urgency to curb global greenhouse gas emissions in order to limit the effects of climate change.
“Even if drastic measures are taken, it will still take time for the climate to stabilize. But real action is necessary to prevent a complete shift,” said Second Committee Rapporteur Elona Gjebrea Hoxha. “It is therefore crucial to increase the awareness of parliamentarians all across the OSCE region and respond to this challenge before it is too late.”
The visit will inform debates of the OSCE PA’s General Committee on Economic Affairs, Science, Technology and Environment at the upcoming Luxembourg Annual Session (4-8 July 2019). The PA’s flagship event will be held this year under the theme “Advancing Sustainable Development to Promote Security: The Role of Parliaments.”
“It is important to closely engage parliamentarians to address the effects of climate change,” said Secretary General Roberto Montella. “I expect the discussions we have had this week will reinforce the Parliamentary Assembly’s engagement on Arctic issues, and we stand ready to support greater international co-operation and dialogue to respond to security, economic and environmental concerns in the High North and beyond.”
The visit continues tomorrow in Oslo, where President Tsereteli and his delegation will hold talks with Storting President Tone Trøen, Minister for Climate and Environment Ola Elvestuen, and Foreign Affairs State Secretary Marianne Hagen. .

The Government of Norway established and fully funded the Svalbard Global Seed Vault.
The overall responsibility for the Seed Vault rests with the government, under the Norwegian Ministry of Agriculture and Food. Daily operations are overseen by the Nordic Genetic Resource Centre (NordGen) under an agreement between the Ministry, NordGen and the Crop Trust (formerly the Global Crop Diversity Trust) which partly provide funding for the Seed Vault’s management.
In addition, the management is overseen by an International Advisory Panel, representing depositing gene banks and stakeholders, that meets regularly for consultations.
Managed by NordGen
Norwegian Ministry of Agriculture and Food administers the Svalbard Global Seed Vault. It funds the operations and management of the facility through Statsbygg, the government institution responsible for state-owned buildings. The Governor of Svalbard is the government’s representative and has overall responsibility for the Seed Vault in Svalbard.
NordGen is responsible for the management of the Seed Vault, including seed operations and liaising with gene banks about options for conserving seeds, preparing documents, facilitating seed shipments, and receiving seeds into the Seed Vault and documenting them. Seed reception normally takes place three times a year, at regularly scheduled and pre-announced Seed Vault openings, or on occasions organised to meet unforeseen scheduling requirements.
Crop Trust partnership
Crop Trust was an important partner in the establishment of the Seed Vault and provides considerable funding for operations costs, as part of its funding scheme for the global genetic resource conservation system.

President of Ghana and co-chair Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo and other members of the Group of Advocates also participated at the event.
The Svalbard Global Seed Vault is the world’s largest backup collection of seed samples from the world’s genebanks. The seeds that were deposited today come from 35 international and regional genebanks, as well as national institutions and civil society organizations, bringing the total number of seed samples stored in the Svalbard Global Seed Vault to more than one million, and the total number of depositors to 85.
Among them were first-time depositors Cherokee Nation (USA), the University of Haifa (Israel), Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique (Morocco), the Julius Kühn Institute (Germany), the Lebanese Agricultural Research Institute, the Baekdudaegan National Arboretum (South Korea), Suceava Genebank ‘Mihai Cristea’ (Romania) and Kew Gardens (UK).
“This deposit event is especially timely, given that 2020 is the deadline for meeting target 2.5 of SDG 2 on zero hunger, which calls on the international community to safeguard the genetic diversity of crops and livestock,” said Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg.
The seeds of several hundred different plant species were deposited today and included common staple crops and a large variety of vegetables, herbs and their less-used wild relatives.
Today’s deposit was the largest since the Seed Vault’s opening in 2008, in terms of the number of institutions to send seeds at one time. It was also the first major deposit since the completion of a technical upgrade in 2019. The improvements that have been made to the Seed Vault include the construction of a new waterproof access tunnel, together with other security measures in preparation for what is expected to be a warmer, wetter future.
“Norway greatly values the trust shown to us by all the genebanks that have chosen to use the Svalbard Global Seed Vault as part of their strategy for securing important seed collections. We are strongly committed to managing the Seed Vault in accordance with the highest agreed international standards,” said Norwegian Minister of Agriculture and Food Olaug Bollestad.
“Every single seed in the Svalbard Global Seed Vault holds potential solutions for sustainable agriculture. Solutions that are vital for feeding a growing population and achieving a green transition. As the operational manager of the Svalbard Global Seed Vault, we are proud to be part of this initiative and to be contributing to reaching SDG target 2.5,” said Lise Lykke Steffensen, Executive Director at NordGen, the Nordic countries’ genebank and knowledge centre for genetic resources.
“As the pace of climate change and biodiversity loss increases, there is new urgency surrounding efforts to save food crops at risk of extinction,” said Stefan Schmitz, Crop Trust Executive Director. “The large scope of today’s seed deposit reflects worldwide concern about the impacts of climate change and biodiversity loss on food production, but more importantly it demonstrates a growing global commitment – from the institutions and countries that have made deposits today and indeed the world – to the conservation and use of the crop diversity that is crucial for farmers in their efforts to adapt to changing growing conditions,” Mr Schmitz said.

Seeds from Royal Estate go to Kew and the Svalbard Global Seed Vault in Effort to Tackle Global Food Security
Hand-picked from the Wildflower meadow at Highgrove, the seeds represent plants that are disappearing from the UK landscape. They highlight the critical importance of biodiversity conservation in confronting the double impact of climate change and biodiversity loss facing our world.
LONDON (25 February 2020) – Seeds of 27 wild plant species from meadows at the Royal Gardens at Highgrove, part of the private residence of Their Royal Highnesses. The Prince of Wales and The Duchess of Cornwall, are being deposited today for longterm storage at the Svalbard Global Seed Vault in Norway. A duplicate collection will be kept at Kew’s Millennium Seed Bank.
The contribution from Highgrove is part of the largest seed deposit to be made since the Seed Vault’s inauguration in 2008. Bringing to over one million the total number of samples placed in the facility so far, today’s deposit contains seeds from more than 30 institutions. This is the biggest and most diverse group to deliver samples of crop diversity all at once since the Vault’s first opening.
“I am delighted that seed from the wildflower meadows at Highgrove are to be safely stored in the Svalbard Global Seed Vault,” said His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales. “Ever since I first arrived at Highgrove 40 years ago this year, I have battled to preserve and protect the crucially important diversity of flora and fauna that ultimately sustains our survival on this planet. This is why I have also done my utmost to help maintain the increasingly rare seeds of heritage vegetables, or the rare native breeds of cattle, sheep, pigs, chickens, geese and ducks, or the countless threatened varieties of apples, pears and plums – all of which were being rapidly abandoned 40 years ago as a result of a fashionable obsession with monocultures of one kind or another.
It has proved to be an exhausting and often demoralizing task to persuade people of the utterly essential role played by all this diversity in maintaining vibrant, healthy ecosystems that sustain both people and our planet.
It’s more urgent than ever that we act now to protect this diversity before it really is too late. Therefore the Seed Vault and seed banks around the world play a vital role in this critically important mission.”
The gardens at Highgrove cover an area of 15 acres and His Royal Highness’s wildflower meadow is around 4 acres. The meadow is home to thousands of wild orchids, of which seven different types are firmly established. The garden is organic and sustainable and works alongside nature. The seeds sent to Svalbard include UK native plants that are in decline due to the proliferation of modern farming methods. Their preservation at Highgrove and now at Svalbard and Kew reflects the Prince’s deep commitment to environmental sustainability.
“The contribution from Highgrove is important not only because of the seeds themselves, but because it sends an important message to the world about the critical importance of biodiversity conservation in confronting the impact of climate change and biodiversity loss,” says Crop Trust Executive Director, Stefan Schmitz. “We’re excited that HRH The Prince of Wales is joining the growing ranks recognizing the urgent need to save our seeds—and our heritage.”
The delivery of such a large consignment of seeds is timely, given that 2020 is the deadline for fulfilling target 2.5 of the “Zero Hunger” Sustainable Development Goal (SDG 2), which calls for the international community to safeguard and share the genetic diversity of crops and livestock.
Underscoring the importance and urgency of this target, members of the Group of Sustainable Development Goals Advocates (the SDG Advocacy Group) took part in the seed deposit ceremony at Svalbard and also contributed to a seed summit on crop diversity for more resilient food systems.
The Advocacy Group is appointed by the UN Secretary-General and chaired jointly by Norway’s Prime Minister, Erna Solberg, and the President of Ghana, Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo. The purpose of the group, consisting of 17 distinguished individuals, is to raise global awareness of the SDGs and of the need for accelerated action to fulfil them.
Scientists at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew received two collections of seeds from The Prince of Wales’s wildflower meadow, one early in the season and one late in the season and they have been stored in the Millennium Seed Bank ever since. The Millennium Seed Bank, located at Kew’s Wakehurst botanic garden in Sussex, is the largest wild plant seed bank in the world and a global resource for the conservation of plants. The Millennium Seed Bank houses over 2.3 billion seeds of 41,000 species.
One collection of HRH’s meadow seeds will be kept at the Millennium Seed Bank, whilst Kew scientists will take the other collection to Svalbard to deposit it on behalf of The Prince of Wales.
Dr Chris Cockel, Seed Conservation Scientist at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew said: “We are delighted to be able to bank this important seed collection from the gardens at Highgrove in the Millennium Seed Bank and at Svalbard. His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales is Patron of both institutions, and this is a brilliant opportunity for us to highlight our collaboration and the importance of meadow species to food security and pollinator services.”

SVALBARD (25 February) – Today, 35 genebanks from all continents deposited seeds at the Svalbard Global Seed Vault, at a deposit event hosted by Norwegian Prime Minister and co-chair of the UN group of SDG Advocates, Erna Solberg. President of Ghana and co-chair Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo and other members of the Group of Advocates also participated at the event.
The Svalbard Global Seed Vault is the world’s largest backup collection of seed samples from the world’s genebanks. The seeds that were deposited today come from 35 international and regional genebanks, as well as national institutions and civil society organizations, bringing the total number of seed samples stored in the Svalbard Global Seed Vault to more than one million, and the total number of depositors to 85.
Among them were first-time depositors Cherokee Nation (USA), the University of Haifa (Israel), Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique (Morocco), the Julius Kühn Institute (Germany), the Lebanese Agricultural Research Institute, the Baekdudaegan National Arboretum (South Korea), Suceava Genebank ‘Mihai Cristea’ (Romania) and Kew Gardens (UK).
“This deposit event is especially timely, given that 2020 is the deadline for meeting target 2.5 of SDG 2 on zero hunger, which calls on the international community to safeguard the genetic diversity of crops and livestock,” said Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg.
The seeds of several hundred different plant species were deposited today and included common staple crops and a large variety of vegetables, herbs and their less-used wild relatives.
Today’s deposit was the largest since the Seed Vault’s opening in 2008, in terms of the number of institutions to send seeds at one time. It was also the first major deposit since the completion of a technical upgrade in 2019. The improvements that have been made to the Seed Vault include the construction of a new waterproof access tunnel, together with other security measures in preparation for what is expected to be a warmer, wetter future.
“Norway greatly values the trust shown to us by all the genebanks that have chosen to use the Svalbard Global Seed Vault as part of their strategy for securing important seed collections. We are strongly committed to managing the Seed Vault in accordance with the highest agreed international standards,” said Norwegian Minister of Agriculture and Food Olaug Bollestad.
“Every single seed in the Svalbard Global Seed Vault holds potential solutions for sustainable agriculture. Solutions that are vital for feeding a growing population and achieving a green transition. As the operational manager of the Svalbard Global Seed Vault, we are proud to be part of this initiative and to be contributing to reaching SDG target 2.5,” said Lise Lykke Steffensen, Executive Director at NordGen, the Nordic countries’ genebank and knowledge centre for genetic resources.
“As the pace of climate change and biodiversity loss increases, there is new urgency surrounding efforts to save food crops at risk of extinction,” said Stefan Schmitz, Crop Trust Executive Director. “The large scope of today’s seed deposit reflects worldwide concern about the impacts of climate change and biodiversity loss on food production, but more importantly it demonstrates a growing global commitment – from the institutions and countries that have made deposits today and indeed the world – to the conservation and use of the crop diversity that is crucial for farmers in their efforts to adapt to changing growing conditions,” Mr Schmitz said.

Potato varieties once thought lost to the Andean people who introduced them to the world will now be safeguarded for future generations
27 August 2015, Svalbard, Norway - Varieties of one of the world's most important staple crops have now been stored for perpetuity deep in the Arctic ice. José Graziano da Silva, Director-General of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) joined scientific experts and delegations from Peru, Costa Rica and Norway to witness a ceremony here that will help to preserve these vital crops for future generations.
The deposit was made at the Svalbard Global Seed Vault, a back-up facility in the permafrost far north of the Arctic Circle that currently holds over 860,000 food crop seeds from all over the world. Its operation is co-funded by the Global Crop Diversity Trust, whose mission is to conserve the planet's crop diversity for the food security of current and future generations, and the government of Norway.
Representatives of indigenous Andean communities who worked together to establish the Parque de la Papa, in Cusco, Peru, have deposited 750 potato seeds. The seeds are the result of benefit-sharing projects supported by FAO's International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture. The farmers were joined by scientists from the Center for Agricultural Research at the University of Costa Rica, who also added wild potato relatives to the largest agro-biodiversity collection in the world.
The potato: A humble giant
The potato originated in the Andes of South America. Over the centuries, Andean farmers have bred over 2,000 varieties in all shapes, colours and sizes. In addition, there are dozens of wild relatives of the potato stretching from Uruguay to Arizona. The potato is now the world's third-most consumed food, feeding more than a billion people every day. This remarkable tuber, which is low in fat but high in protein, calcium and vitamin C, is grown on every continent where people live.
However, changing climate and diseases such as potato blight − which causes $8.5 billion worth of potato losses every year in the developing world alone − pose a significant challenge to this priceless natural resource, as do the modernization of agriculture and changes in land-use. Many potato varieties have been lost in recent decades, both to the Andean communities from which they originated, and to the global community as a whole.
In response, a coalition of local, regional and international partners joined forces to reintroduce potato varieties in the field, and to preserve these vital plant genetic resources in genebanks. The Peru-based International Potato Centre (CIP), home to the world's largest potato crop collection, is working to preserve and reintroduce the diversity of potatoes in partnership with local and regional initiatives across the globe. Working with Asociación ANDES-IIED and Parque de la Papa, CIP has, since 2002, returned over 400 potato accessions to indigenous communities.
International treaty supports sharing of knowledge
The sharing of such plant genetic resources across national boundaries is facilitated by the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture.
The Treaty, which is hosted at FAO, works through a multilateral system of access and benefit-sharing that helps ensure that farmers and researchers have access to a large diversity of seeds and other plant genetic material - and a fair share of the benefits resulting from any new varieties. The genetic information held in many crop varieties and wild plants supports the development of new fast-growing, high-yielding crops - as well as varieties that are more resistant to heat, drought, salinity, pests and diseases, all critical traits in a warming world.
For example, with funding from the Treaty's Benefit Sharing Fund, and further support from the Crop Trust, farmers involved in the Parque de la Papa learned how to pollinate their potatoes and collect seeds for storage. Some of the seeds were used to develop new varieties to feed their communities, while others were prepared and shipped to Svalbard for today's deposit.
FAO Director-General José Graziano da Silva and the depositors from Peru and Costa Rica were greeted by Marie Haga, Executive Director of the Crop Trust, Hanne Maren Blaafjelldal, State Secretary at the Norwegian Ministry of Agriculture and Food at 17:50 local time and escorted deep into the subterranean storage vault for the deposit.
A shared effort, a common good
Founded ten years ago by FAO and the Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research (CGIAR), the Crop Trust is the international organization devoted solely to safeguarding the world's crop diversity. To this end, it is seeking to raise a total of USD 500 million, which will guarantee the maintenance and availability of key international plant collections of critical importance to our food supply, including that of CIP.
Norway is one of the biggest supporters of the Crop Trust's work. It currently funds a 10-year global project that seeks to safeguard the wild relatives of the important food crops. And it is thanks to the generous support of the Norwegian people and government that the Seed Vault has become a reality.
From 2006-11, while heading FAO's Regional Office for Latin America, Graziano da Silva actively supported crop conservation initiatives, including the Parque de la Papa. Four years later, and many miles from the Andes, he oversaw the seed deposit that assures potato diversity will be safeguarded for the future.
The combination of in situ conservation in the field, including community seed banks, with ex situ preservation in international genebanks - combining centuries-old tradition with cutting edge science - is now coming full circle. Local farmers growing varieties that were previously feared lost are sharing the diverse collection of potatoes - this global common good - with the world, and making sure back-up copies are safely secured in the Arctic tundra of Svalbard so that they will never lose them again.
Quotes from:
Minister of Agriculture and Livestock of Costa Rica, Luis Felipe Arauz Cavallini
""Costa Rica welcomes this new opportunity to deposit Costa Rican seeds in Svalbard Global Seed Vault. This is a way to conserve our plant genetic heritage and safeguard it in perpetuity in case of any eventuality, whether natural, pests, diseases, or even disaster caused by humans.""
José Graziano da Silva, Director-General, FAO
""In a few decades, our planet's food systems will need to feed an additional 2 billion people. Producing more -- and more nutritious -- food will be made all the more challenging as a result of climate change. Agricultural biodiversity -- like that locked inside the potato seeds being deposited here today -- is essential to facing these challenges, by helping us develop better, more resilient crops.""
Marie Haga, Crop Trust
""Today's deposit represents an important chapter in the global campaign to preserve our crop diversity forever and provides a perfect example of how in situ conservation and ex situ preservation can work together for the good of all. We are absolutely delighted to welcome the Director-General of the FAO and our esteemed colleagues from Peru and Costa Rica to the Seed Vault today, for this hugely significant event.""
Hanne Maren Blaafjelldal, State Secretary at the Norwegian Ministry of Agriculture and Food
""I am very proud that 40% of the crop diversity that are stored in the world's gene banks by now is safeguarded in the Seed Vault. These seeds may be of crucial importance for global food production in the future.""
Alejandro Argumedes, ANDES
""This kind of international collaboration is vital for all of our futures. These seeds, and The Potato Park farmers who are the innovators and leaders of their preservation, have been on a remarkable journey - travelling over 11,000 kilometres from the mountains of Peru to Svalbard. Asociación ANDES is proud to have played its part.""

Arctic Call to Action on Food Security and Climate Change
UN Secretary-General Mr Antonio Guterres has called for a decade of action and delivery to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030. With just 10 years to go, there is an urgent need for an intensified global effort to achieve the goals. The broad mobilisation of governments, business and civil society will be required. ‘Now is the time for bold leadership, both individual and collective. […] We need to move together,’ Secretary-General Guterres stated in September 2019.
Members of the Secretary-General’s group of SDG Advocates, which is co-chaired by Prime Minister Erna Solberg of Norway and President Nana Akufo-Addo of Ghana, met on 25 February 2020 in the Arctic archipelago of Svalbard, Norway, to discuss food security and climate change. They also took part in a seed deposit event at the Svalbard Global Seed Vault. The Seed Vault serves as a backup facility for the genetic diversity of seeds for future generations.
For decades, the number of people living in hunger was declining, but since 2015 this number has once again started to increase. According to the 2019 UN report State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World, more than 820 million people are undernourished. Reversing this trend and ending hunger and all forms of malnutrition by 2030 is an immense challenge, but it is also essential if we are to reach the other SDGs. In particular, SDG target 2.5 – maintaining the genetic diversity of seeds, cultivated plants and farmed and domesticated animals and their related wild species – is highly relevant to these efforts, and was addressed specifically in Svalbard.
The following points formed the basis for our discussions in Svalbard:
The world’s land and water resources are being exploited at an unprecedented rate, and this is threatening to undermine humankind’s ability to feed itself. Climate change is making the situation even worse, as increased climate variability and more frequent extreme weather events threaten to disrupt, and over time diminish, the global food supply. The impact of climate change is having serious consequences for agricultural production. There is an urgent need for increased ambition and action to promote effective implementation of the Paris Agreement.
If we are to succeed in ensuring food security for growing populations in an increasingly warmer world, we must continue to adapt our food systems to climate change as well work to make them more inclusive and efficient. Transforming our food systems offers a pathway to improved resilience of ecosystems, reduced vulnerability of rural populations to climate impacts, and enhanced contributions to climate change mitigation. Genetic diversity is essential for ensuring sustainable agriculture. By making use of this diversity, we can develop crops that are more heat-, drought- and flood-resistant.
But the clock is ticking. SDG target 2.5 calls on the international community to maintain the genetic diversity of both crops and livestock by 2020, and promote access and benefit sharing. Currently, the international community is not on track to reach this target.
The genetic diversity of food is essential for food security. Today, some 60 % of our daily calories come from just four crops (wheat, rice, maize and potato). It is the vast range of species and varieties cultivated by farmers that underpins the resilience of our food supply; in fact, we are dependent on this diversity for our food security, wellbeing and health.
Small-scale food producers play a key role in ensuring global food security, but they are vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Supporting these producers so that they can adapt to climate change is therefore a key priority.
The UN Secretary-General hosted Food Systems Summit in 2021 offers an opportunity to catalyze large-scale public mobilization and actionable commitments to make food systems sustainable, climate adapted, resilient and to the benefit of all.
We, the group of SDG Advocates hereby issue our Arctic Call to Action on Food Security and Climate Change:
We remind all people as a matter of urgency that the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the goals set out in the Paris Agreement are the roadmap to our common future, and that we must leave no one behind as we strive to reach these goals.
We urge all governments, as well as the private sector and civil society, to heed the UN Secretary-General’s call to commit to a decade of action and delivery for sustainable development, so that we can reach the SDGs by 2030.
To this end, we call on all leaders and decision-makers to recognise the fact that the various SDGs are interlinked. We will not reach the goals if we do not eradicate hunger and combat climate change.
We therefore urge governments to step up their efforts to maintain genetic diversity, including through soundly managed seed and plant banks. We encourage gene banks to make use of the Svalbard Global Seed Vault as part of their strategy for securing their important seed collections.
We urge all citizens, in particular agricultural decision-makers, to give priority to the sustainable use and conservation of agricultural biodiversity for future generations and ensure equitable sharing of benefits arising from these resources.
We encourage governments, researchers, the private sector and civil society to step up their efforts to promote climate adaptation and disaster risk reduction in both agriculture and aquaculture, with a view to ensuring that small-scale food producers can maintain and increase their food production in a changing climate. We stress that efforts should be taken to ensure that the coming UN Summit on Food Systems in 2021 will lead to concrete actions to ensure sustainable food systems and provide a crucial boost to the delivery of all SDGs.

filmfreeway,https://filmfreeway.com/ArcticFilmFestival ,"UPDATE: In light of Corona-virus, we want to assure our filmmakers that we are fully committed to run our events and honor all filmmakers who have submitted to us from around the world. Our 2020 event will be moved to 2021. All selected filmmakers will be notified further.
Welcome to the Arctic Film Festival, the world’s northernmost celebration of independent filmmaking!
From the same team that brought you the successful Oslo Film Festival, Arctic Film Festival aims to recreate the familiar cozy atmosphere and rigorous programming in Longyearbyen, 650 miles from the North Pole.
It's dark for four months of the year and light for another four months, but we’ll be welcoming adventurous filmmakers from all around the world to Kulturhuset in Svalbard while the sun still rises above the horizon. We’re preparing a programme that includes both outdoor activities in the daylight, and quality international screenings in the evening.
Our festival provides not only a diverse cinematic experience for audiences and filmmakers alike, but also an opportunity to reflect on the future of our planet as well as our role within it. Our main goal with Arctic Film Festival is to increase the audience reach and engagement of select independent filmmakers who challenge and reflect on global scale problems. This is a unique opportunity to screen your work in one of the most outstanding venues and locations in the world!
In addition to live screenings, we offer:
❄ Networking events
❄ Filmmaker roundtable
❄ A worldwide network of filmmakers and collaborators
❄ A guided tour exploring the magnificent natural surroundings of Svalbard
We accept films of all genres and lengths, released in or after 2019, but we prioritise works that push the boundaries of human endeavour. We’re excited to review and showcase adventure films, social impact documentaries, and films with a focus on human rights.
❄ For our special focus on social impact films, we have created a discounted category celebrating work that promotes the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity is interconnected – often the key to success on one will involve tackling issues more commonly associated with another.

Abstract
Plastic marine pollution in the Arctic today illustrates the global distribution of plastic waste of all sizes traveling by wind and waves, entering food chains, and presenting challenges to management and mitigation. While currents move plastics from lower latitudes into the Arctic, significant waste is also generated by remote communities, as well as maritime activities, such as shipping, fishing and tourism, which are increasing their activities as seasonal sea ice diminishes. Mitigation strategies may include monitoring programs of plastic waste abundance and distribution, improved waste management in Arctic communities, Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) to reverse the transport of waste plastics and packaging from remote communities, incentivized gear recovery of abandoned, lost and discarded fishing gear (ALDFG), gear tagging and tracking, and restricting tourism and employing “leave no trace” policies. Here we report how these mitigation strategies are employed in the Arctic to minimize plastic waste impacts, and move Arctic communities toward better materials management and circular economic practices. The evidence of harm from waste plastics exacerbated by the ubiquity of plastic marine pollution in all biomes, and the rapid reporting of ecological and social costs, together suggest that we know enough to act quickly to manage and mitigate plastics from all sources to the Arctic. . The Svalbard archipelago in the High Arctic is influenced by cold Arctic water masses from the north-east and the warm West Spitsbergen Current flowing northwards along its western coast. The eastern waters and the fjords are normally frozen during the winter months, while the coastal waters west of the archipelago remain open. Norwegian fishers have been harvesting from Svalbard waters for decades and detailed records of catches exists from 1980 onwards. We analyze the catch records from the Svalbard zone (approximately ICES area IIb). The large fishery for capelin in summer yielding annual catches up to 737 000 tons was closed by a Norwegian fishery regulation in the mid nineteen nineties. Demersal fisheries have been continuous, and the results clearly indicate a northward trend in landings of Northeast Arctic cod, haddock, ling and Atlantic halibut. Fisheries of Northern shrimp have been more variable and shown no clear geographic trends. A “gold rush” fishery for scallops north of Svalbard lasted for about 10 years (1986–1995) only, and ended due to low profitably. These results are discussed in relation to the possibility of further northward extension of fisheries subjected to climate change. .

The visit runs over two days from Tuesday to Wednesday, and both seeds and climate are on the agenda.
On Tuesday, a large conference will be held where representatives of around 30 gene banks from around the world will gather to deposit seed samples to the global seed vault on Svalbard.
The seed vault is already the world’s largest and has so far stored more than a million samples.
“Climate change and a dramatic decline in species diversity makes it more important than ever to preserve the genetic variation among the world’s food plants,” says Solberg in a press release ahead of the visit.
Also attending will be several members of the UN Sustainable Development Goals Group, including Ghana’s President Nanna Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, who heads the group with Solberg.
On Wednesday, Solberg will take the UN group on a boat trip to take a closer look at the rapid climate change on Svalbard.

svalbardislands,https://www.svalbardislands.it/en/the-svalbard-islands-and-respect-for-the-environment/ ,"On the Svalbard Islands respect for the environment is a serious matter. In this isolated corner of Earth, the future is being protected, battling for all humanity.
The effects of climate change and the protection of animals
Over the past twenty years, the Arctic region has slowly undergone changes that are today causing devastating effects: we see this in the soil, in the water and even in the air. Unfortunately, these effects have serious consequences even on animal protection. Global warming is causing the permafrost to thaw and sea ice to shrink. This means that, for many native species, continuing to live in what was once their natural habitat has become almost impossible. There are many animals at risk because they form an unbreakable food chain, but the animals worrying scientists the most are polar bears. Several recent studies suggest that in thirty years they could be on the verge of extinction. Will it be possible to reverse the change by paying greater attention and having true respect for the environment? In the meantime, bear hunting on the Svalbard Islands has been halted, but this is just one of a series of necessary measures.
Safeguarding agricultural biodiversity
The concept of extinction is unfortunately not only linked to the animal world, but also the plant world: many plant species today on Earth risk disappearing for ever. In 2008 the Svalbard Global Seed Vault was inaugurated to store seeds and preserve agricultural biodiversity. It is a breathtaking construction that rises up from the snow drifts, which was designed to withstand any global disaster and last for thousands of years.
Even the Svalbard Islands are concerned about the destiny of the ecosystem, and this is why we support sustainable fashion and reject so-called fast fashion, the impact of which has disastrous effects on our environment. The use of robust materials that stand the test of time means saving energy, something we must all aim for.
Mass tourism yes, but with respect for the environment
Whoever loves nature must protect it. Even on holiday we shouldn’t forget to respect the environment. Even though their distance from the mainland prevents the Svalbard Islands from being a destination of mass tourism, many adventurers choose this area as a dream destination. For this reason, many projects have been developed to promote sustainable tourism, which foster a successful economy while focussing on social and environmental aspects. .

ssab,https://www.ssab.com/news/2019/03/the-worlds-northernmost-rds-piles-from-ssab-in-longyearbyen ,"The world’s northernmost RDs piles from SSAB in Longyearbyen, Svalbard
It's getting warmer and the climate is changing. On Svalbard, an archipelago situated in the Arctic Ocean, the climate change may be faster than anywhere else on earth. The annual average temperature on Svalbard can increase from -5.9 to as much as +3.3 degrees Celsius, while precipitation can increase by 40 %. Multiple avalanches have impacted Svalbard in recent years, this has resulted in the loss of 15 residential units and a shortage of private housing. Also, several government residential buildings are located in avalanche-prone zones.
Installed and ready RDs220/12,5 piles seen from NE. (Image courtesy: Thomas Mjøsund)
The project’s overall goal was to meet the need for new residences as soon as possible. This meant quick and effective processes where all of the new houses were prefab modules shipped from mainland Norway and installed on site. 60 new residential buildings making up 8.000 m2 were installed together with new roads and water mains. RDs piles together with the steel foundation framework from mainland Norway, created a solid foundation.

Leonhard Nilsen & Sønner AS (LNS) are the main contractors and one of North-Norway’s largest entrepreneurs specialized in demanding projects that include difficult logistics. The project was very important for LNS position in Svalbard. This has big impact on the local society and business in Svalbard. Kynningsrud Fundamentering AS acted as the piling contractor.
Gruvedalen in Longyearbyen seen from SW (Image courtesy: Thomas Mjøsund)
The main principle for building in permafrost areas is to avoid disturbance of the ground temperature profile. Due to changes in climate an increase in ground temperatures is expected. This leads to a thicker active layer, lower load-bearing capacity and increased settlement rates. That requires longer piles with larger diameter. End bearing RD piles drilled into the bedrock is a good solution for this. The foundations must have a sufficient depth to ensure that the active layer remains above the foundation throughout the life cycle of the building.
SSAB delivered close to 250 tons of RDs220/12.5 in 3 m lengths to Kynningsrud Fundamentering AS and LNS. All piles were delivered with threaded splices to avoid welding at site and to speed up the installation of over 3 800 m of piles. Summer temperatures at only 7 degrees, wind and rain created a tough working site. The most critical part of the delivery from SSAB was to get 11 trucks from Finland to Tromsø before the boat departure. If the boat was missed, it meant 2 weeks of delay at the site.

morningagclips,https://www.morningagclips.com/svalbard-global-seed-vault-reopens-for-first-deposit-of-2021/ ,"SVALBARD, Norway — Among the first deposits of 2021 are seeds of watermelon, strawberry and pumpkin, coinciding with FAO’s International Year of Fruits and Vegetables. This deposit includes the seeds of many other crops from genebanks in Africa, Europe and South Asia.
Fruits and vegetables may not come to mind when picturing the frozen, barren landscape surrounding the Svalbard Global Seed Vault, but that’s where their seeds will be deposited for long-term safekeeping this week.
The Seed Vault is humanity’s largest crop diversity collection, and one that is designed to endure the effects of time.
In total, five genebanks are depositing almost 6,500 seed samples at the Seed Vault: AfricaRice in Côte d’Ivoire, ICRISAT in India, the Julius Kühn-Institute (JKI) in Germany, SADC Plant Genetic Resources Centre in Zambia and the national genebank in Mali. The Seed Vault safeguards more than one million seed samples in total, deposited by almost 90 genebanks over the past 13 years.
This deposit will mark a notable first: JKI’s seeds will be deposited into the same box as last year to save space for future shipments. New features in the updated database system, The Seed Portal, make this possible.
The Seed Vault was opened in 2008 as a backup for genebanks around the world to conserve duplicates of their crop diversity. In a worst-case scenario, if a genebank collection is destroyed or becomes inaccessible due to wars or extreme weather events, or if its collection is damaged due to a lack of sufficient funding or accident, the duplicate seeds will still be available for the depositor to retrieve from the Seed Vault and start anew.
Despite the ongoing pandemic, the Seed Vault is scheduled to open twice more this year, in May and in October.
“The Svalbard Global Seed Vault protects the work and heritage of generations of farmers going back more than 10,000 years and contains the crop diversity to adapt our agriculture to the changing climate,” said Crop Trust Executive Director Stefan Schmitz. “We are losing the earth’s biodiversity at an accelerating rate. Conserving our crop diversity and making it available for use is a prerequisite for future food security and better food systems. As a backup to genebanks, the Seed Vault plays an essential role in food and nutrition security.”
“COVID-19 is putting increased pressure on genebanks around the world, however, these institutions were still able to deposit their seeds for safeguarding, a testament to the resilience and importance of multilateral cooperation,” said Schmitz. “Amidst this great upheaval are signs that positive change is still possible and that the global community can continue to work together to solve urgent crises.”
“As we travel to Svalbard this week to deposit seeds sent from genebanks located in three different continents, the mission of the Svalbard Global Seed Vault and the world’s genebanks has never been more important,” said Lise Lykke Steffensen, NordGen’s Executive Manager. “In a time of climate change, unprecedented loss of biodiversity and a global pandemic, we are humbly grateful for the trust these genebanks show us. Their seed samples are invaluable and a prerequisite for our future food security. It is our honor to put them on the frozen shelves of the Seed Vault for safe, free-of-charge and long-term storage.”
“We welcome the deposits of new seeds of fruits, vegetables and other important food crops to the Seed Vault. This diversity contributes to nutritious food and constitutes the building blocks for adapting food production to climate change. This deposit is thus a small, but significant step on our pathway to reach the Sustainable Development Goals,” said Norwegian Minister for Agriculture and Food Olaug Bollestad.

Description
Nature
An Arctic archipelago (total land area ca 62 700 km²), approximately 60 % of which is covered by snow and ice. The highest point is Newtontoppen 1713 m a.s.l. Cold water and air masses from the polar region, which meet warmer water and air masses from the south (the Atlantic Ocean Current), produce great differences in climate within the archipelago. Nevertheless, Longyearbyen receives only 190 mm of precipitation and northern and eastern parts of Svalbard may be characterisered as an Arctic desert.
Svalbard has bedrock from almost every geological period, as well as rich occurrences of fossils. The sparse vegetation means that the history of the evolution of the Earth and geological processes are unusually distinct. Svalbard is a natural archive for geology and natural history that is of great scientific value.
Svalbard has a varied high-Arctic environment where large areas are little affected by modern human activity. It has mountains and valleys with glaciers, permanent snowfields, nunataks, plateaus with virtually no vegetation, canyons, large valleys with rich tundra vegetation, long fjords and fjord glaciers, as well as low-lying wetland plains, beach ridges, islands, lagoons and bird cliffs on the coasts.
The vegetation cover is sparse, but there are large geographical variations. The diversity of species is great despite the isolated location of the archipelago. A total of 1143 species of plants have been recorded, 173 of which are vascular plants.
Large populations of Arctic foxes (Alopex lagopus), Svalbard reindeer (Rangifer tarandus platyrhynchus) and marine mammals like polar bears, various species of seals (including walrus) and whales (11) are found. Svalbard char (Salvelinus alpinus) live in lakes and rivers in many parts of the archipelago. Svalbard has numerous seabird colonies and many important breeding sites for geese and eider ducks. Several species have their northernmost breeding areas and/or habitats in Svalbard. A total of 203 species of birds have been recorded, 49 of which are known to have bred here. The waters around Svalbard house rich marine resources on which many species of animals and birds depend.
The natural biological diversity and the on-going ecological processes are largely intact. Major technical encroachments are mostly concentrated in the few settlements, and Svalbard can be regarded as the largest and least disturbed wilderness area in Norway.
Cultural history
Svalbard is in a special situation in being located close to the North Pole and at the same time being easily accessible thanks to open waters as a result of warm ocean currents. People from many parts of the world have visited and periodically lived and worked in the archipelago, mostly on a seasonal basis, since its discovery by Willem Barentsz in 1596. They came here to hunt and trap, explore and carry out research or prospect for and work the mineral resources. In the past 100 years or so, these activities have provided a basis for year-round settlement. There are now Norwegian and Russian communities with modern infrastructure and a total population of approximately 2600. At the same time, large areas are virtual wilderness and are subject to strict protection regulations.
Several nations hunted whales here from the 17th century. As early as the 18th century, Russian trappers overwintered here to hunt and trap seals (especially walrus), foxes, polar bears and reindeer. Trapping traditions are to a limited extend continued on certain species. The archipelago has been an important area for journeys to the North Pole, exploration and research since the 19th century, with participants from many nations. Substantial deposits of minerals and metals have been found, and have formed the basis for industrial activity. Coal mining began early in the 20th century. Companies from several countries have mined coal, but now only Norwegian and Russian companies are involved. Attempts have been made to work other mineral resources, some of which were aborted due to special natural conditions (for example, marble). The easy accessibility of the archipelago has meant that tourism is now a growing livelihood.
Statements of authenticity and/or integrity
The natural biological diversity and the ongoing ecological processes are largely intact. Major technical encroachments are mostly concentrated in the few settlements, and Svalbard can be regarded as the largest and least disturbed wilderness area in Norway.
The objective of the Norwegian Government (Report No. 8 (1999-2000) to the Storting) is that the large, continuous areas of wilderness and the cultural heritage sites in Svalbard must be protected from significant encroachments and impacts. Svalbard must present itself as one of the best-managed wilderness areas in the world, and the settlements must be run in an environmentally justifiable manner to protect the environment and ensure well-being. The near-Arctic waters must, furthermore, be preserved as some of the cleanest in the world, and the resources must be utilised within limits that ensure the maintenance of biological diversity in both the short and the long term.
More than half (65.3 %) of the area is currently protected with the intention of preserving the unique natural environment, landscape and cultural heritage of Svalbard (7 national parks, 6 nature reserves, 15 bird sanctuaries, 1 protected geotope). Cultural heritage sites dating from earlier than 1946 are automatically protected. That includes sites of WWII war-related activity.
The Svalbard Treaty as a management model is unique in an international context. In 1925, Norway acquired sovereignty over Svalbard, but citizens from all the 39 signatory nations to the Treaty were given equal rights to hunting, fishing, industrial activities, commerce and mining. To day these activities are strictly regulated by the Svalbard Environmental Act. The Treaty lays down clear limitations on the military activity Norway can pursue in Svalbard, and prescribes a general ban on using Svalbard to pursue war.
Comparison with other similar properties
Natural heritage
Polar areas are, in general, poorly represented on the World Heritage List. Thematic studies of mountainous areas on the World Heritage List also single out Svalbard as one of 28 candidates with potential before the theme is covered.
Svalbard differs significantly from existing World Heritage Areas in the Arctic (the Wrangel Islands and Ilulissat Isfjord). Svalbard has qualities within themes like landforms, bedrock geology, Quaternary geology, flora, fauna and the marine environment that will be a substantial contribution towards achieving a representative selection of high-Arctic environments on the World Heritage List.
Cultural heritage
Polar areas are also poorly represented on the World Heritage List as regards cultural heritage.
Systematic comparative analyses of cultural values have not been undertaken, but will probably concern:
- Franz Josef Land
- Novaya Zemlya
- Parts of Greenland
- The archipelago in northern Canada
The concentration of international cultural heritage covering a 400-year time span is Svalbard's particularly important contribution to World Heritage in the Arctic. Parts of this heritage picture may be seen in other Arctic areas; for example late 19th and early 20th century west-European hunting and trapping activities in East Greenland, early 20th century mining in Alaska and Yukon, 19th century sea mammal hunting in various areas, early exploration camp sites in many areas including Frans Josef Land. However no other, relatively concentrated, area in the High Arctic contains the diversity of Svalbard's non-indigenous heritage stretching from the early 17th century whaling stations to the post World War II protected coal-mining infrastructure. .

As part of CGIAR Genebanks standards, at least 90% of the accessions that are “in Trust” must be safety duplicated in Svalbard. Many of the accessions are part of the Regional Genebanks collections that were sent to India for long-term conservation and for safety duplication. ICRISAT Genebank has a strict agenda on regeneration of accessions and seed multiplication as per genebank standards, to be able to not only conserve the accessions properly but also to be able to safety duplicate them.
ICRISAT Genebank has Standard Operating Procedures for all its activities. All packing and labelling were done by the genebank trained staff with special materials. The aluminium foils were developed specially for the safety duplication in Svalbard. The common ones, used in all genebanks’ long-term cold rooms have three layers.

Hi Reddit and fellow ice-lovers,
We are Frigga Kruse, Franziska Paul, and Linus Müller-Hillebrand of the Timeless Arctic Project and we are part of the Timeless Arctic Project. Over the course of five years (2018-2023) we are assessing the impact humans had on Svalbard - a formerly pristine environment until it was discovered by European whale hunters.
Also in the team, we have a drone pilot, a scientific illustrator, a nature photographer and filmmaker, a specialist in plastic waste, a psychologist, a bacteriologist, and an archaeologist.
The project is funded by the Volkswagen Foundation as a Freigeist Project since 2018. That basically means that we've got a nice pot of money and can work on a project, which the foundation deemed to be inventive and original. In our case, we want to quantify the human presence and the commercial hunting in the formerly pristine ecosystem of Svalbard.
Frigga is our team leader. She has a PhD in Arctic Archaeology, specilised in Svalbard (which she has visited many times), and this is her project. Svalbard was first documented by Willem Barents in 1596. Soon afterwards, Europeans voyaged to the North to hunt bowhead whales, polar bears, Atlantic walrus, Arctic foxes, and Svalbard reindeer. The populations of these ""Arctic Big Five"" got diminished to the point of almost-extinction. In the 20th century, protective measures were implemented in hopes of recovering the populations. Now Frigga wants to quantify the number of animals killed and study the human-animal-interactions of 420 years of Svalbard history.
Franziska is doing her PhD in Archaeozoology. Her goal is to study the remaining walrus bones left by European hunters. She will count the number of dead animals, quantify the age structure and look for marks on the bones, which will tell her how the animals were killed. This way, she will find out more about hunting techniques of past times.
Linus is the EOC Officer (Education, Outreach, and Communication) and is responsible for PR. Besides working for TA, he is doing a M.Sc. in Environmental Management.
Us three are here today to answer your questions about the Arctic, Svalbard, the project itself, and whatever else comes to your mind.
What do you think of the increasing tourism on Svalbard? I'm surprised at the number of hotels in Longyearbyen.
Linus - I sometimes think about my own interest in going there. I could theoratically do my research locally as well. But I chose Svalbard because... I want to go there? In a way, I'm a tourist as well, but I try to justify it with doing something valuable while I'm there.
Frigga: When coal mining in Longyearbyen came to an end, the town had to reinvent itself. Or diversify. Tourism plays an important part in people's livelihoods, but it was never investigated if there should be an upper limit and how it could be implemented. Due to Covid19, many things will change now.
I occasionally work on smaller expedition cruises. I like the communication platform for my research. However, I am not reliant on the income, and I would rather not work on bigger ships.
As someone who grew up there it depends on season. Winter tourism has very little impact on anything. The plant life on Svalbard takes 10000 years to recover from damage, but snowmobiles in windows don't cause any damage to it.
Summer tourism is a different story and should be limited to the ""towns"" and existing roads and by water and beach camping.
How is Svalbard ? I came to know of it first when I read of it in ""His Dark Materials"" and have been fascinated by how isolated it is. Also considering the current pandemic how is the COVID situation there?
Frigga: Yes!, His Dark Materials and that film The Golden Compass instantly home in on Svalbard. I couldn't believe it! Mind, Svalbard in summer is not like the book at all. Svalbard in winter is not far off though, esp. if you sit in a small hunter's cabin in the middle of a snow storm (I have to imagine this; I have not done this myself).
When I am guiding tourists, I tell them to pack like they are going to Scotland in late autumn. The summer whether, during which I do my guiding, is fairly changable but not that extreme. Rain mixed with wind chill is a bummer.
Hallo :), when did you know you want to become a scientist? Was there a special experience?
Frigga: I really like new knowledge, so I went to university in the first place to get loads and loads of new knowledge in the Bachelor and later in the Master degree. I am quite good at languages, but I did not want to do a language degree because I thought I would only be learning what I already know, just in a new language :/ (Of course, you learn about cultures, etc, too, but such was my thinking back then).
Once at uni, you kind of drift into your research direction :) You have to pick something for your dissertation anyway and eventually you get hooked on something that really interests you :)
Did that give you an idea?
Linus - I quit two majors before I started Biology and suddenly it just clicked. Sometimes things just fall into place.
Franzi:My father once built me a pond, as I was so fascinated by animals, and said ""I am pretty sure you are going to study biology when you grow up"". That was the point I always said ""I want to study biology and become a scientist"".
When is the best time of the year to visit Svalbard?
Frigga: Of course that depends on what you go for. If you are interested in Arctic wildlife, I recommend round about end of July: all the newborn are underway then!!! Fox cubs, reindeer calves, chicks of any kind!!!
However, there is also something to be sad for the polar night in Longyearbyen or for when the light comes back and you travel further afield in a snowy, cold but beautiful landscape.
Whatever you do, you will need a guide and polar bear watch. You cannot leave Longyearbyen by yourself.
Winter time while it's still snow but the sun is back at least for a few hours of daytime. You get the views, the light, the blue light, the snow, and trips on snowmobiles to see the glaciers and the nearest old Russian town and polar bears.
How would you rate a) polar bears and b) puffins on a scale of 1 (kinda boring, will not be looking for those) to 10 (SO EXCITING I WILL BE MAD IF I DO NOT SEE THEM EVERY. SINGLE. DAY. THAT I SPENT IN SVALBARD!!!!)?
Frigga: Polar bears are a 10 for nerve-wrecking! At least if you are on land and then need to evacuate :/ Puffins are a 10 for ""customer satisfaction"" :) They make tourists in general and photographers with large lenses in particular very happy when I am guiding :)
Franzi: For both I have to say I would be very excited to see them and the rest of Svalbard's wildlife. However, I would prefer seeing the polar bear from a long distance
Linus - I haven't been there yet, so I'd totally go for a ten on both. Polar bears, because I want to see them before they see me (since I don't plan on being eaten just yet). And puffins because the populations are decreasing and seeing them would be really nice.
Apart from these logical reasons, it would also be heckin nice to see Arctic animals in general when I'm there. It's part of the expereince, I guess?
Have you listened to The White Vault?
Frigga: I had not heard of it, but now I have saved it. I do like audiobooks and stories, so this will be a treat.
Hello! I was wondering what each of your favorite films are?
Franzi: Catch me if you can

lifeinnorway,https://www.lifeinnorway.net/svalbard-history/ https://www.lifeinnorway.net/staying-safe-on-svalbard/ ,"High in the Arctic, a few thousand hardy souls and a bunch of polar bears call the Svalbard archipelago home. The history of these remarkable islands is a long and fascinating one.
How does a collection of frozen rocks in the Arctic become an important yet unassuming location of geopolitical importance for centuries? Join me as we discover how, time and time again, Svalbard found itself in the right place at the right time.
Located 580 miles (930 km) North of Tromsø, roughly halfway between Norway and the North Pole, Svalbard is an archipelago comprising nine main islands with a total area of 24,209 square miles (62,700 square km).
At 74-81 degrees north in latitude, it’s well inside the Arctic Circle. It’s certainly not the sort of place you stumble upon while sailing anywhere you’d want to be! Instead, like so many things, we have 16th Century European Imperial expansion to thank.
The discovery of Svalbard
While many Norwegians believe the Vikings discovered Svalbard in 1194, there’s no evidence of this outside of the mention of ‘Svalbarði’, the ‘cold rim’ in the Chronicles. This was somewhere found after a few days sailing north from Iceland, which could easily be Svalbard but could also be Jan Mayen, or even just an area of pack ice.
Of course, it’s always safer to defer to the Vikings so in the absence of real evidence to the contrary, I’ll let them have this one! If nothing else, it did give the place its name of Svalbard.
The real, documented history of Svalbard, however, begins in 1596 when a Dutch explorer by the name of Willem Barentsz set out on his third and final voyage to discover the Northeast Passage.
Read more: Fascinating Facts about Svalbard
The aim was to find a quicker way to get trading ships from Europe to the Pacific and Indian Oceans without having to go all the way down almost to Antarctica.
Originally discovering a small island that they named Vogel Eylandt or Bird Island that eventually became Bjørnøya or Bear Island, the southernmost island of the Svalbard archipelago.
A week or so later they found Spitsbergen, Svalbard’s largest island, where they explored a little and set up a post bearing the Dutch coat of arms.
The voyage then returned to Bear Island and a disagreement led to the two ships splitting up and taking different courses. Tragedy struck and Barentsz lost his life.
Barentsz never did find the Northeast Passage but the sea between Scandinavia and Svalbard bears his name today. The islands were explored by Henry Hudson – of New York river fame – in 1607 and three years later the islands became the focus of a more commercial activity.
Gold in the sea
In those days, oil was a much sought-after commodity. Though crude oil and its products were known in the Middle East, much of the world still relied on plants and animals for fuel and lubrication. Whales and walruses are particularly prized for this because while they’re difficult to kill and capture, the rewards are huge.
Read more: The Remarkable Winter Wildlife of Svalbard
In 1604, a Walrus hunting expedition to Bjørnøya was organised by the the Muscovy Company, a British trading company. Their lack of expertise meant they weren’t very successful, but they returned over the next few years, killing more and more each time until they eventually reached local extinction.
The Muscovy Company then turned its attentions to Spitsbergen, where whales had been reported in huge numbers. Their first expedition in 1611 ended in shipwreck and rescue.
In 1612 they sent out a fresh expedition and encountered Dutch and Spanish whalers. These were expelled by the Muscovy Company using force, which led to an international conflict.
The Danish-Norwegians and the British both claimed exclusive rights, while the French, Dutch and Spanish claimed it was free due to being in International Waters.
Realising that it was destroying their profitability they agreed to partition the island and then, when The Muscovy Company went out of business, the Dutch effectively controlled the island, allowing the English, French and Danish only limited access.
Read more: Living on Svalbard
At its height, Spitsbergen was supporting 2-300 whaling ships and in excess of 10,000 whalers split between crew catching whales and the land stations where the whales were processed.
As with the walruses, the whales were killed faster than they could be replaced and eventually the crews had to move out to open sea to find their quarry.
As more of the processing started to be done at sea, and the rest moved to the mainland, the need for facilities in Spitsbergen dwindled. The most famous whaling land station, Smeerenburg, was abandoned in 1660 and another chapter in Svalbard’s history closed.
A centre of exploration
The whalers had built up a highly detailed knowledge of the coastal geography, but the inland was still mainly unexplored.
The first accidental overwintering on Spitsbergen occurred in 1630-31 by an English group, followed in 1633-4 by a Dutch group who successfully completed the first planned overwintering. This proved that, while challenging, permanent settlements on Svalbard would be possible.
Following the decline of the whaling industry around Svalbard, the 18th century became more about exploration. Another unsuccessful Russian expedition to find the Northwest Passage in 1764-66 made scientific measurements of the island’s topology.
In 1773, a British Royal Naval expedition took zoological and botanical samples from the island. As scientific exploration gathered pace, many large and small scale investigations took place over the most of the 18th and 19th centuries.
The British, Norwegians, Swedes Russians and French all mounted expeditions and it was a British cartographer, Martin Conway, who produced the first map of the island’s interior.
As well as studying Svalbard itself, the islands proved a useful starting point for Arctic exploration. Several expeditions, including Roald Amundsen’s airship Norge, widely credited as the first successful mission to the North Pole by air, started out from Ny-Ålesund.
Exploiting the natural resources of Svalbard
The first attempt to create a permanent settlement in Svalbard was by a Swedish team planning to mine Phosphorite, a phosphor-rich rock. The settlement was established but the mining never took place and it was quickly abandoned. Attention soon turned to coal and after a couple of semi-successful attempts, the first enduring mining operation started in 1906.
The Arctic Coal Company was started under the direction of the American industrialist, John Munro Longyear who purchased rights to the west side of Adventfjorden. The town of administrators and labourers that sprung up was named Longyear City, later renamed to the Norwegian translation, Longyearbyen.
Another entrepreneur, Ernest Mansfield, attempted to mine marble. The operation started but the marble that was mined was found to be unusable and soon folded. By the 1910s it was accepted that coal was the only resource in Svalbard that was worth mining.
The Swedish set up mines at Pyramiden (1910) and Sveagruva (1917) and the Dutch established Barentsburg (1920).
Meanwhile, due to difficulties in the First World War, the Arctic Coal Company ceased trading in 1916 and the town and its mines were bought by Store Norsk Spitsbergen Kulkompani (SNSK) often known simply as Store Norsk. The Norwegians enhanced their mining activities in the same year by opening up mines in Ny-Ålesund.
Through all of this time, no one owned Svalbard. Denmark-Norway claimed the land, but it continued with no government and no formal laws. It was effectively a mining colony with interests run by various companies and governments, mostly harmoniously. As time went on, however, there came a need for somebody to take charge and settle disputes.
The Svalbard Treaty
Attempts to establish an administration in Svalbard actually began as far back as 1897, when the Finland-Swedish explorer Adolf Nordenskiöld established that only the Danish-Norwegians and the Russians would object to the annexation of the islands.
In 1907, the Norwegian Government formally opened multilateral negotiations between the interested parties. Various proposals were advanced at conferences through the 1910s but it wasn’t until the Paris Peace Accord at the end of World War I that the breakthrough finally came.
Norway had gained much goodwill through remaining neutral during the war. Germany and Russia were both excluded from the conference and, in February 1920 the Svalbard Treaty granted Norway full sovereignty over the archipelago. This came with two conditions.
Firstly, all signatories to the treaty had equal rights to the economic resources there. This meant that Norway couldn’t decide to kick all the other countries out of Svalbard and keep it to itself.
Secondly, the islands could not be used for any ‘warlike purposes’. Nobody could turn the islands into a staging post for military conflicts. We’ll see how well that worked in a few paragraphs!
The treaty came into effect in 1925 and by 1927 all outstanding conflicts, regarding who owned what, had been resolved. The Norwegian government claimed all unclaimed land. Over the 1920s and 30s, mining declined to the point where only Store Norske and the Soviet state-owned Arktikugol remained.
The Second World War
Svalbard was actually fine during the early years of the Second World War when the Germans occupied Norway in 1940, until 1941 when the Germans invaded the Soviet Union. The Soviets joined the allies and Svalbard was suddenly a strategically important place for the Allied supply lines.
Initially the Russians proposed joint Anglo-Russian occupation of Svalbard but the Norwegian exiled-government rejected this as being against the treaty.
So, the Norwegian and Soviet settlements were abandoned. Germany, seeing an empty staging post of strategic importance, occupied Longyearbyen and built an airstrip and weather station. In 1942, tried to liberate the island. Though attacked by German forces they managed to set up a garrison in Barenstburg.
The Germans then abandonded Longyearbyen and instead, through Operation Zitronella, attacked the island with destroyers and battleships to level Longyearbyen, Barentsburg and Grumant. In 1944 they returned with bombers to destroy Sveagruva.
After the war, the Norwegians and Soviets resumed their operations and rebuilt the settlements that had been destroyed. Mining continues on Svalbard to this day, with both Norwegian and Russian operations.
Connecting to the world
Even though Longyearbyen was a year-round settlement throughout most of the 20th century, it was still a company town. The infrastructure was there to support the mining operations rather than to create a place where families could live and build a community.
In the 1970s, the Norwegian government started talking about the need for a process of ‘normalisation’ to turn the company town into a regular community that could be self-sustaining beyond the mining operations.
The biggest step forward was the opening of the Longyearbyen airport in 1975. This allowed for regular and rapid transport between the island and the mainland, allowing Svalbard to be much less cut-off during the harsh winter.
Even so, it wasn’t until the 1990s that normalisation became a reality. The authorities introduce a full range of services, including building a shopping mall, and diversified the economy. The first proper hotel, the Svalbard Polar Hotel, opened in 1995, paving the way for tourism.
Ny-Ålesund
While Longyearbyen was the first major settlement, and remains the world’s northernmost viable community town, Ny-Ålesund is also a major part of Svalbard’s history. It’s a town that started in mining and transformed into a major global research centre, bringing down an entire government along the way!
Established in 1917 by Peter Brandal and his mining company, Kings Bay Kul Comp was nationalised in 1933 after years of poor performance. Mining continued until a series of fatal incidents, including one accident that killed 21 miners, caused a huge scandal.
The Norwegian cabinet under Einar Gernhardsen resigned and mining operations were suspended permanently. Over the following years a number of research facilities opened, such as the Kongsfjord Telemetry station. Kings Bay sold all of its coal claims to Store Norske, keeping only the property rights.
The year-round population of Ny-Ålesund today is around 30, mostly scientists, rising to around 120 in the summer months. It’s still a company town, and whilst it’s not a real family community, it does lay claim to being the world’s northernmost functional civilian settlement.
Russian settlements
While Norwegians dominate the population of Svalbard, and Longyearbyen is the largest town, that wasn’t always the case. Russia entered the coal mining industry of Svalbard by establishing a mine at Grumant before also taking on the Dutch and Swedish concerns at Barentsburg and Pyramiden.
After the second world war, the Norwegians managed to get back to pre-war levels of mining quite quickly but the Russians took much longer and required more manpower. At one stage, there were 2,000 Russians producing less coal than the 1,000 Norwegians on the island.
The settlement at Grumant grew to 1,200 people, making it the largest in Svalbard. It was abandoned in the 1960s but the remains are still there today. Pyramiden lasted longer, operating until the 1990s before being abandoned. The town does have a caretaker population of 6 in the summer and attempts have been made to turn it into a tourist attraction.
The Russians still operate mines on Svalbard, in Barentsburg. The town has a population of 470, making it the second largest settlement in the archipelago. This is made up almost entirely of ethnic Russian and Ukrainian workers.
They are trying to attract tourism to the town but the infrastructure of the island makes this difficult and the efforts have yet to generate enough income to revive Barentsburg.
The town is around 55km from Longyearbyen and there are no roads. Transport between the two is by boat, snowmobile or helicopter. As Svalbard is sovereign Norwegian territory, there is a Russian Consulate in Barentsburg. This is the northernmost diplomatic mission in the world.
The future of Svalbard
Today, tourism accounts for an increasing percentage of the island’s economy. As mining is subject to the ups and downs of global coal prices, dipping in and out of profit, so the island needs to attract money from elsewhere.
While a few hardy tourists are willing to visit in the harsh winter months, the summer is when Svalbard really comes alive. A town of just over 2,000 people welcomes tens of thousands of tourists, through flights and cruise ships each year.
This poses problems for Svalbard. As a unique example of inhabited arctic desert, both the community and the ecosystem are fragile. The more people who come and spend their Krone the better, but there are recognised problems with having so many people visit.
Another threat to Svalbard’s future is climate change. As the world heats up, the polar regions are heating up even more quickly.
This year saw Longyearbyen smash its previous highest temperature when the weather station recorded a temperature of 25.7 degrees Celsius (78.3 Fahrenheit). This may not sound much, but in a place with averages highs in the low teens, this is big news.
With luck and good judgment, Svalbard will be able to navigate away from a mining economy without harming the infrastructure or environment that makes it such a magical place.
No one knows what the future holds but I’m personally hoping that Svalbard is around for centuries to come. . There are many dangers when visiting Longyearbyen and Svalbard. Here’s how to avoid getting into trouble.
To experience nature in its wildest form, few places on earth are better than Svalbard. The Arctic archipelago at 78 degrees north has rightly earned a stellar reputation in the world of adventure tourism.
Biggest dangers on Svalbard
The Svalbard archipelago is classified as Arctic desert. The environment is likely to be very different from anything you've experienced before, with added risk factors. The most common dangers on Svalbard include:
- Polar bears: There is a very real risk of running into one of Svalbard's few thousand polar bears outside the settlements
- Avalanches: Climate change is causing an increase in the number of avalanches throughout the archipelago
- Frostbite: The most common injury on Svalbard can creep up on you and be extremely dangerous
How to stay safe on Svalbard
The number one rule on Svalbard: The only person responsible for your safety is you. If you don't have experience in such an environment, you should not go out of the settlements on your own.
The main settlement of Longyearbyen is comparatively safe to the rest of the archipelago but there are still significant dangers. Polar bears are unlikely to enter the settlement itself but it can and does happen. Be on your guard especially in the dark season.
In 2015, an avalanche destroyed 11 houses in a residential part of the town. Another avalanche in 2017 has caused more houses to be evacuated and knocked down because of the high risk.
Roads and paths can be extremely slippy so wearing spikes is recommended during the winter and spring. Wearing a hi-vis reflective jacket is a good idea during the darkness.
Leaving the settlements
First and foremost, it is not recommended to leave the settlement for long periods of time on your own or in a small group without a qualified and experienced guide. Still, many people choose to do so, so here are some important guidelines.
You must familiarise yourself with the laws of the land, for they are different from mainland Norway. All visitors venturing outside Management Area 10 (check local maps) are required to notify the Governor of their plans and take out search and rescue insurance.
Check the website of the Governor of Svalbard for the latest information including avalanche risk. While they are increasingly common in Longyearbyen, landslides and avalanches can and do happen anywhere. In 2019, two Polish researchers were killed at a remote research station and in March 2020, two German tourists died following an avalanche near Barentsburg.
Clothing should always be suitable for the season, but windproof and waterproof layers are required year-round. Always take extra layers, especially hats, gloves and socks. There are well-stocked sports and outdoor stores in Longyearbyen should you need additional clothing.
Frostbite
In the winter, temperatures can be low and frostbite can set in quickly. To put it simply, frostbite is the freezing of the skin and underlying tissue. Exposed skin is vulnerable, particularly the fingers, toes, nose, ears, cheeks and chin, but it can also strike under clothing and gloves.
The biggest cause of frostbite is insufficient clothing, usually on the hands, feet and face. During the winter it is important to cover all bare skin, including the face. Two pairs of socks and mittens are highly recommended.
Be sure to know your route in advance and don’t dawdle, especially if you are walking between the commercial centre and Nybyen.
The risk of polar bears
The risk of a polar bear attack is very real. For this reason, you are not permitted to leave the settlement without a suitable gun (.308 Win calibre rifle or higher) and the ability to use it for protection. You should also have equipment to scare off polar bears, such as a flare gun.
Some weapons and other equipment can be rented in Longyearbyen, but you should check the website of the Governor for the latest information on permit availability.
The Governor recommends to keep weapons semi-loaded. This means there is ammunition in the clip, but not in the barrel to prevent accidental firing. Flare guns must not be loaded when travelling in built-up areas.
At camp, the Governor recommends there be someone on permanent polar bear watch. Trip wires and/or trained dogs can also be used as a supplemental warning system, but bears have been known to jump over trip wires.
If you come across a bear, every attempt should be made to scare it away using flare guns or other items.
Navigation & communication
Because of erosion, glacial flows, and snow storms, the terrain on Svalbard can change at short notice, making map reading challenging at times. Sea charts in particular can be inaccurate.
One of the biggest risk factors to exploring on your own is that there is no mobile phone signal outside the settlements. You are obliged to take an emergency beacon on longer trips. In the event of a life-threatening situation, activate the beacon to alert the joint rescue coordination centre.
It is also a wise idea to take a satellite phone with you. The emergency number for the Governor of Svalbard is 0047 79 02 12 22. When using a satellite phone, you must always dial the 0047 prefix.
If venturing out of Longyearbyen on your own or in a small group, you should always notify someone of your intended route and your planned time of return.
Equipment
Here is a list of equipment you'll need for an expedition away from the settlements. This is not intended as an exhaustive list, more as a checklist to help with your preparations:
- Weapons and items to scare away polar bears
- GPS, map, compass, and a satellite phone
- Emergency beacon
- Waterproof and windproof clothing to cover your entire body, including face
- Emergency rations and hot drinks
- First-aid equipment
- Tent, ground sleep, sleeping bag
- Rescue equipment for glaciers
- Matches in watertight container
- Fuel burner and fuel for cooking
- Survival suit if travelling on water
- Winter: Torch with extra batteries (kept in a warm place), candles
- Winter: Avalanche probe, ice claws, heaving line, snow shovel
Last but not least, it should go without saying but please don't leave anything behind. The Arctic environment is extremely vulnerable. While it's impossible to leave no trace, it should be your aim.
This article isn't meant to put you off from exploring one of the world's most intriguing destinations. If it does, consider joining a guided tour, especially if you've never spent any time hiking in the Arctic winter before. Take sensible precautions and your trip to Svalbard will give you memories for a lifetime!

arcticwwf,http://arcticwwf.org/work/climate/ ,"Arctic Climate Change
What happens in the Arctic doesn’t stay in the Arctic. The Arctic is warming faster than any other region on Earth, and the world is already feeling the effects.
FEATURED
Arctic countries need to lead the cut of CO2
The hottest temperature ever measured above the Arctic circle was recorded in Verkhoyansk, Siberia this past June. In fact, the + 38.6°C reading was just one of many highs that made June 2020 in Siberia five degrees warmer than any June from 1981 to 2010. A recent Oxford University-led study shows man-made climate change due to carbon emissions made this Siberian heatwave 600 times more likely. Read more
The Arctic is warming at a rate of almost twice the global average.
Without urgent action to cut greenhouse gas emissions, the world will continue to feel the effects of a warming Arctic: rising sea levels, changes in climate and precipitation patterns, increasing severe weather events, and loss of fish stocks, birds and marine mammals.
Why it matters
The average temperature of the Arctic has increased 2.3°C since the 1970s.
By 2100, polar bears could face starvation and reproductive failure even in far northern Canada.
Around 35,000 walruses came ashore on the Alaska coast in September 2014. It’s the largest ‘haul out’ ever recorded. US government agencies estimated that 60 young walruses were crushed in the crowd.
Warmer winter temperatures have also increased the layers of ice in snow, making food more difficult to dig up in winter.
Fish stocks in the Barents Sea are moving north at up to 160 kilometres per decade as a result of climate change.
The fish are sensitive to changes in water temperature. This poses a risk for commercial and subsistence fisheries that may see fish resources move away from where they can harvest them. The moving fish also change the ecosystems into which they move.
On the tundra, rising temperatures have brought a new competitor - the Arctic fox’s much larger cousin, the red fox. Not only does the newcomer colonise their dens, it can also kill the smaller Arctic foxes.
In the ocean, both scientists and Inuit say killer whales appear to be increasing in numbers, and in the length of time they stay in the Arctic. Killer whales prey on narwhals and bowhead whales.
With increased shipping comes spill risk (both fuel and cargo), “black carbon” emissions that help to speed the rate of Arctic melting, ship noise that may also affect whales, and icebreaking that can disrupt ice crossing routes for people and animals.
In 2013, a large bulk carrier transited the Northwest Passage for the first time. In 2018, the first cargo ship transited the Arctic north of Russia.
Reduced ice cover is making offshore oil production in the Arctic more commercially viable. In 2014, the first commercial development of offshore oil (Prirazlomnoye) was pumped from Russian Arctic waters.

Hundreds of plant species around the world were backed up today at a “doomsday vault” in Svalbard, Norway, the first big deposit to the Arctic facility since an upgrade to future-proof it against climate change.

The seeds of onions from Brazil, guar beans from central Asia and wildflowers from a meadow at Prince Charles’s home in the UK are among the species being safeguarded at the Svalbard Global Seed Vault, housed in a mountain cavern about 1200 kilometres from the North Pole. Around 60,000 new seed samples were added, taking the total to more than a million.
In twilight on the mountainside where the vault’s iconic entrance juts out, the first seeds were delivered to a backdrop of a male choir singing. As the snow came down, teams at seed banks from Portugal to Mexico walked their valuable cargo into the entrance tunnel, their names read out by one by one.
Norwegian prime minister Erna Solberg attended the mass deposit, the single biggest since the opening of the facility in 2008. “The deposit event is especially timely,” she said ahead of the event, because this is the year by which countries should have safeguarded the genetic diversity of crops to meet the United Nations goal of eliminating hunger by 2030.
Speaking in Svalbard, the president of Ghana Nana Akufo-Addo said of the vault: “It is the great insurance policy for food security.” Agriculture in Ghana is already under pressure from climate change, he added.

The vault is designed as the ultimate insurance policy for restoring crop diversity to smaller seed banks around the world after extreme weather, conflict, fire and other events. The first withdrawal from the bank took place in 2015, to help conservationists who lost access to a major seed bank in Aleppo in the Syrian civil war.
However, the resilience of the vault itself has recently come under the spotlight. The permafrost on Spitsbergen, the island in the Svalbard archipelago where the bank is located, means the seeds should stay frozen even if the cooling system that keeps the vault at -18°C is hit by a power failure.
Yet in October 2016, the entrance tunnel to the facility was flooded due to a combination of heavy rainfall and permafrost melting. While the vault itself was untouched, that year the Arctic experienced record heat that scientists say was almost certainly due to human-made climate change.
The latest deposit marks the first time the vault has opened its doors to new seeds since a €20 million upgrade that includes a new waterproofed access tunnel, plus measures to prepare it for a world on track to be several degrees hotter by the century’s end.
Solberg told New Scientist that the fact the facility had required upgrading so soon after its opening was a symbol that climate change is coming more rapidly than expected. “Now we have planned for worst case scenarios in a better way,” she says.
Seed collectors from 36 banks around the world – eight for the first time – brought seeds for accessions, the term used for new samples entering the bank. The Svalbard facility is effectively a backup of the backups.

Among the seeds that made the three-hour flight north from Oslo are those from the Cherokee Nation, the first US indigenous tribe to deposit seeds at the vault. Corn that is sacred to the Cherokee people, bean varieties and a squash that can stay fresh for a year without refrigeration are among their crops being backed up.
The UK’s Kew Gardens brought 27 wild plant species from Prince Charles’s residence in the west of England. These include wild carrot (Daucus carota) and some forage species such as perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne), red fescue (Festuca rubra) and clover (Trifolium sp.), as well as five species of orchid. “It’s more urgent than ever that we act now to protect this diversity before it really is too late,” the prince said in a statement.
The Indian seed bank ICRISAT is brought more than 2800 accessions, adding to the more than 110,000 it has already deposited.
Others like the Julius Kühn Institute in Germany brought their first seeds, including the European crab apple (Malus sylvestris), a wild relative of domesticated apples. Seed banks in Morocco and South Korea are also made their first deliveries.
The vault will still have plenty of space after the new arrivals, as it has capacity for around 4.5 million samples.
Norwegian PM Solberg tells me the €20m waterproofing upgrade to Svalbard seed vault so soon after it was built is a sign climate change is happening more rapidly than we thought. “Now we have planned for worst case scenarios in a better way,” she says at #seedvault2020 pic.twitter.com/QBNaq4xSpt
— Adam Vaughan (@adamvaughan_uk) February 25, 2020
Hannes Dempewolf at the Crop Trust, one of the partners that runs the vault with the Norwegian government, says that although today’s deposit takes the samples past the milestone of one million, Svalbard is “not just a numbers game” but is instead about prioritising unique species.
It is best practice to have a double backup of global seed banks, he says, both at the Svalbard vault and in other seed banks. Maintaining plant diversity is “incredibly important” for developing new, more productive crop varieties, he says.
But Dempewolf says seed banks are increasingly being called on to help farmers adapt to a warming world, too. “As we see the climate heating up and places looking for [crop] varieties to use in more challenging conditions, these seed banks are being more actively used.”
Safeguarding a diversity of crops is considered vital to humanity being able to feed itself as climate change takes hold.
Justify Shava at the SADC Plant Genetic Resources Centre in Zambia, a regional seed bank for 16 African countries, says farmers have called on it to provide varieties of sorghum – a type of grass used for flour – that can cope with very little water and grow rapidly.
Seed banks in poorer countries also face their own challenges. In some cases, the biggest short-term obstacle is a lack of funding, because they aren’t a political priority, says Dempewolf. But he says they should also “expect the unexpected”, such as the impact of conflict.
The seeds in Aleppo were also backed up across 11 seed banks globally, but withdrawing them from just one – the Svalbard vault – was the cheapest option, says Ahmed Amri, the head of genetic resources at the International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA).
“Surprisingly, they are in top shape,” he says of the seeds recovered from the vault to replenish ICARDA’s collection, which was moved from Aleppo, Syria, to escape the civil war and is now in Lebanon and Morocco. He says the withdrawal shows the Svalbard vault is of practical use as well as of importance for long-term conservation.
ICARDA began depositing seeds in Norway in 2012, as the situation in Syria began deteriorating. It is impossible to say what condition the seeds left behind in Aleppo are in, says Amri, because the only thing he knows is that it had electricity to keep cooling systems running until 2017. The Syrian army has since entered the premises, but hasn’t let experts in to assess the seeds, he says, though he hopes to one day recover them.

Those of us fortunate to live at 78˚ North feel like we’re living in a dream – a genuine Arctic fairy tale. We have experiences in everyday life in this landscape dominated by tundra, bare mountains, glaciers, extreme light variations and an exciting animal life that would be hard to match anywhere on earth. We love life here in Svalbard, and we can’t for a moment imagine a better place to live. We call this the “Polar bug”, a term indicating your constant desire to return after setting your feet here for the first time. Are you ready to be bitten by the Polar bug...?
To the uninitiated, Svalbard may seem desolate and barren with large open landscapes, sparse vegetation and endless glaciers. But if you look beyond this first impression, you will discover an eldorado of nature-based experiences – all year round. The seasonal variations this far north are enormous – the long, dark season is replaced by bright winter months, which in turn are replaced by a surprisingly mild summer with sun 24/7.
During the Polar Night, the months of darkness from October to January, the Northern Lights dominate the sky both day and night. The residents of Longyearbyen – the world’s northernmost urban community – spend a lot of time at social gatherings. We meet at pubs and restaurants, concerts or exhibitions or at each other’s homes. Good food, good drinks and varied cultural offerings are the key to enjoying this season, which many locals regard as the best time of the year.
Nevertheless, we look forward to the light at the end of the tunnel of darkness, and in February the sun slowly but surely rises above the horizon again. The play of colours we experience during this time is beyond beautiful. Blue skies and snow-capped mountain peaks provide the background for the sun’s return, and the rays of sun turn the blue colours to pink. We call this phenomenon the “blue light” and, to put it simply, it’s something you must experience to understand. As the light changes, so too do the interests of the local population. Instead of seeking cosiness indoors, we head outdoors into the winter landscape on skis, by snowmobile or on a sled behind a team of eager huskies. Sometimes we prefer short trips and sometimes longer expeditions over glaciers or frozen fjords. Maybe we see polar bears, maybe we seek shelter in an out-of-the-way cabin or maybe we don’t go far from our doorstep to experience the surrounding wilderness.
After the winter, around mid-May, a short spring awaits us, followed by a slightly longer summer. The archipelago is invaded by birds which migrate here in vast numbers to nest. On the seemingly inhospitable tundra, a minor miracle occurs at ground level as a rich flora emerges in the most unthinkable of places, offering life where you would hardly believe it was possible for plants to take root. When the landscape dries up after the snow melts, countless possibilities for hiking emerge. Many locals transform into eager hikers and head for the mountain peaks which surround Longyearbyen. Consequently, outdoor recreation still dominates the lives of the locals. Hiking boots make way for boats or kayaks when we set our sights on slightly longer trips.
Svalbard is large and diverse, boasting nature which is surprisingly rich and extremely varied. At the same time, we have personal experiences of climate change and the threats it poses here in the Arctic, and we are worried about the future. Life in Longyearbyen may be perceived both as different and perhaps extreme, but for those of us fortunate to live here, it’s hard to imagine anything else. We live as one with nature, and we work in harmony to uphold the good life that we do have throughout the enormous seasonal variations in temperature, light and darkness. We love this place and are proud to call ourselves Svalbardians. We also love to receive visitors from all over the world – all year round.
I welcome you to Longyearbyen and Svalbard – and hope you have wonderful, memorable and profound experiences as a guest in our small, local community. Please remember, if you are bitten by the Polar bug, it’s harmless even though it will remain in your body for a long time!

Longyearbyen is the world's northernmost sustainable destination
Longyearbyen is the world’s northernmost sustainable destination. The small town is the administrative centre of Svalbard and is home to around 2,100 people from 50 different countries. A tiny, colourful metropolis on the top of the world inhabited by nature enthusiasts living in close unity in tough climatic conditions. In Longyearbyen, the High Arctic wilderness begins in the town centre and virtually never ends.
Maybe that’s why many are surprised to discover the outstanding dining and drinking options, varied shopping and rich cultural offering on offer in Longyearbyen all year round. Did you know that little Longyearbyen boasts two of Norway’s best restaurants?
However, it probably comes as no surprise that the inhabitants are fond of their town. With the beautiful Svalbard nature as their backyard, they are possibly more engaged than most in matters concerning environmental protection and sustainability. The same goes for the guests who visit us. Increasingly more tourists demand and choose destinations that demonstrate responsibility, and which offer genuine experiences of high quality.
The Svalbard nature is vulnerable and there is a delicate balance between protection and use. The effects of climate change are more visible in the Arctic than anywhere else, and the theme of sustainability is more relevant than ever. This coincides with a major transformation for the local community in the years ahead, with mining on the way out and an ever-expanding tourism industry. Sustainable solutions will play a pivotal role on this transformation.
The purpose of this article is to provide you with information about how to experience our archipelago with a good conscience. However, it’s important to start by telling you how we work as a sustainable destination and what this slightly irreproachable theme really entails.
In 2016, after several years of strategic work, Longyearbyen was awarded Innovation Norway’s “Sustainable Destination” label. Longyearbyen was one of the first destinations to be labelled as sustainable – and that’s something we are very proud of.
The labelling scheme is based on international standards and the 10 recognised principles for sustainable tourism which are guiding for our work.
However, many ask the question: How can Longyearbyen be called a sustainable destination when its energy comes from coal mining, virtually all consumer goods are imported to the island and there are daily flights up and down to the mainland? Some also reflect on summer days when large cruise ships sail into the Isfjord and up to 4000 guests disembark in our small town. Is Longyearbyen really a sustainable destination?
Having this label does not mean that our destination IS sustainable. However, the label is an important tool for developing in the right direction and committing us to a continuous process of reducing footprints and greenhouse gas emissions. For the tourism industry in Longyearbyen, this involves always making active and serious choices locally. Tiny Longyearbyen cannot bear the brunt alone, nor save the world. But we can implement important local measures, make wise environmental choices and not least increase awareness of sustainability among the tourism industry, the local population and our guests. Non-renewable energy sources and emissions from aircraft and boats are the framework we must relate to. Despite many paradoxes and challenges, the destination is working to improve the condition within these scopes.
Many associate “sustainable tourism” with measures to reduce emissions to air and the amount of plastic in the ocean. Yes, looking after the nature and the environment are an important part of the concept of sustainability, but a central part of the understanding is the interaction between the tourism industry, local authorities and the local community. A good place to stay is a good place to visit, and the tourism activities must make a positive contribution. Furthermore, sustainability has an economic perspective. The tourism must contribute to the local community to have something to live by. How we manage our cultural heritage is also part of a sustainable tourism industry. Moreover, all of this must have a long-term perspective.
The strategy document “Master Plan - Destination Svalbard Towards 2025”, which was created by industry and local politicians in 2015, has helped us to take mutual and correct steps in the development of a destination experiencing growth.
Let’s start with one of the most comprehensive initiatives first. As part of the above-mentioned master plan mentioned above, a plan for urban development has been prepared (Thematic plan for traffic and adventures), which outlines how Longyearbyen can be adapted to benefit guests and residents alike. This may include footpaths, bridges, signs and presentation of cultural heritage sites. We want to control where people move. By doing this, we can avoid wear and tear on the nature, safeguard people’s safety and create valuable meeting places in Longyearbyen. Measures from this thematic plan are about to be implemented, which will make the local community less vulnerable to a tourism industry undergoing further growth.
The tourism industry in Longyearbyen has a focus on communicating the Northern Lights winter in Svalbard, which is currently our low season. From November to January, the aircraft are half full and the hotel capacity can be utilized better. The Polar Night offers wonderful nature-based experiences in Svalbard, but maybe this is under-communicated? By spreading the guest traffic throughout the entire year, the tourism industry contributes to a healthier economy and a more viable local community with safe year-round, full-time jobs.
When developing new tourist experiences, tour operators are encouraged to think of urban activities that may be operated year-round. It’s gratifying to see that these activities are also the most popular! In Longyearbyen, the is wilderness is right on our doorstep and there is also an abundance of cultural offerings.
Hosting courses are arranged for service employees, while there is a certification programme for guides. It is important for us that the guests feel welcome and well taken care of while they are here and that they receive good information including about the “Do's and don'ts” in the Svalbard nature. Moreover, employees in this industry should feel a sense of unity, ownership and local identity, and be confident and proud of what they are conveying to our guests.
Insights from regular visitor surveys provide the tourism industry with important information that will further improve the ongoing work. Although the number of tourists visiting is increasing, new results hot off the press show us that the guests still perceive Svalbard as genuine, untouched and authentic. This is an indication that the growth is being managed correctly.
Svalbard Cruise Network is a joint project in the tourism industry, which was formed to coordinate the local activity towards the cruise ships calling in the summertime. Good dialogue with the cruise lines is an essential part of this to ensure those visiting here relevant prior knowledge about Svalbard. Efforts are underway to get the cruise ships to spend longer in Longyearbyen, so the passengers can visit the town at different times. This contributes to better experiences for the guests and those living here, and to increased value creation in the local community. The cruise network is also working to encourage the cruise lines to spend a few extra days extra in the Isfjord. This means more experiences, slower sailing (slow-cruise) and less fuel consumption than previously, as many only made a short visit to Longyearbyen on their way to or from the northwest coast of Spitsbergen and Magdalene Fjords.
Other initiatives include free loan of town bikes and kick sleds, regular rubbish clean-up initiatives, anti-idling campaigns, better waste management and facilitation of locally produced goods. Visit Svalbard is leading the way as the destination company by being environmentally certified. Other tourism companies have been encouraged to follow suit. Companies that take sustainability seriously will be prioritised in various contexts.
As a tourist, you can choose green tourism operators. Several tourism companies, including accommodation providers, have gained environmental certification in recent years. The same goes for the festival organisers. Did you know that the Taste Svalbard festival, PolarJazz and Dark Season Blues are all environmentally certified events?
Choose local activities close to town. There is an abundance of exciting options in and around Longyearbyen. This includes both culture- and nature-based experiences. In Longyearbyen, the Arctic wildlife is practically right on your doorstep.
Choose some non-motorised activities. You will find various options year-round, including skiing, kayaking, dog sledding and hiking. We promise that the peace and tranquillity in the Arctic will make a deep impression on you.
Choose local food. Are you aware how great Svalbard reindeer and grouse taste? What about fresh cod straight from the Isfjord? Exceptional! The local dishes from Svalbard also convey an exciting story about the hunting and trapping traditions in the archipelago. Ask you waiter what the local options are!
Buy locally produced products like knives, chocolate, beer, exclusive bottled water, woollens, wooden chopping boards, soaps, art or jewellery. It’s even more enjoyable to give locally made gifts when you get home.
Visit the tourist information centre and borrow a free town bike. The hosts will provide good advice about what to wear, help you to find the activity that best suits you and give you general advice about safety.
Read the Svalbard Guidelines and other guidelines for the world’s northernmost community, which outline how tourists should behave here. By the way, did you know that picking flowers in Svalbard is not allowed even though they are so beautiful? This is to protect the vulnerable biodiversity.
Last, but not least, we encourage you to travel on fewer trips per year and instead stay longer in one place. Allow time to really embrace beautiful Svalbard, discover the stillness and the feeling of humility in the majestic nature. Seek out the locals who can provide insider tips and advice. Remember to go on organised activities when you visit Svalbard. Your safety will be taken care of by the local guides and we guarantee you will get more out of the experience.
Remember to always show respect for the local population, nature and wildlife
We wish you a warm welcome to Svalbard!
If you have any questions about Longyearbyen as a sustainable destination, please don’t hesitate to contact Director of Tourism Ronny Brunvoll or Project Manager Trine Krystad.

Sustainability in the local tourism industry
From 2016 to 2019 Visit Svalbard was a proud holder of Innovation Norway’s label as a Sustainable Destination. The label scheme has been an important tool for Visit Svalbard, the local businesses, and the destination at large in working seriously towards sustainability and improving sustainability in the local tourism industry in Svalbard day by day, and year by year.
Attaining the label is a demanding job, requiring resources both in terms of labour and funds. This also goes for the re-labelling process, which was planned to be undertaken in 2019. Unfortunately Visit Svalbard was not able to procure the funding required to initiate this process before the deadline for re-labelling had passed, and the following Covid-19 situation has led to additional challenges. As such, Visit Svalbard is as of 2020 withdrawn from the label scheme, but we’re continuing to work towards gathering the necessary funding. Our ambition is that we’ll be re-labelled over the course of 2021, and that we’ll once more be a part of the important cooperation towards sustainability that the label symbolises.
Visit Svalbard encourages work on environmental certification of companies in our destination as one of the main focus areas in our sustainable policy. In addition to Visit Svalbard itself, the companies listed below are certified.

Longyearbyen is the world's northernmost sustainable destination
Longyearbyen is the world’s northernmost sustainable destination. The small town is the administrative centre of Svalbard and is home to around 2,100 people from 50 different countries. A tiny, colourful metropolis on the top of the world inhabited by nature enthusiasts living in close unity in tough climatic conditions. In Longyearbyen, the High Arctic wilderness begins in the town centre and virtually never ends.
Maybe that’s why many are surprised to discover the outstanding dining and drinking options, varied shopping and rich cultural offering on offer in Longyearbyen all year round. Did you know that little Longyearbyen boasts two of Norway’s best restaurants?
However, it probably comes as no surprise that the inhabitants are fond of their town. With the beautiful Svalbard nature as their backyard, they are possibly more engaged than most in matters concerning environmental protection and sustainability. The same goes for the guests who visit us. Increasingly more tourists demand and choose destinations that demonstrate responsibility, and which offer genuine experiences of high quality.
The Svalbard nature is vulnerable and there is a delicate balance between protection and use. The effects of climate change are more visible in the Arctic than anywhere else, and the theme of sustainability is more relevant than ever. This coincides with a major transformation for the local community in the years ahead, with mining on the way out and an ever-expanding tourism industry. Sustainable solutions will play a pivotal role on this transformation.
The purpose of this article is to provide you with information about how to experience our archipelago with a good conscience. However, it’s important to start by telling you how we work as a sustainable destination and what this slightly irreproachable theme really entails.
In 2016, after several years of strategic work, Longyearbyen was awarded Innovation Norway’s “Sustainable Destination” label. Longyearbyen was one of the first destinations to be labelled as sustainable – and that’s something we are very proud of.
The labelling scheme is based on international standards and the 10 recognised principles for sustainable tourism which are guiding for our work.
However, many ask the question: How can Longyearbyen be called a sustainable destination when its energy comes from coal mining, virtually all consumer goods are imported to the island and there are daily flights up and down to the mainland? Some also reflect on summer days when large cruise ships sail into the Isfjord and up to 4000 guests disembark in our small town. Is Longyearbyen really a sustainable destination?
Having this label does not mean that our destination IS sustainable. However, the label is an important tool for developing in the right direction and committing us to a continuous process of reducing footprints and greenhouse gas emissions. For the tourism industry in Longyearbyen, this involves always making active and serious choices locally. Tiny Longyearbyen cannot bear the brunt alone, nor save the world. But we can implement important local measures, make wise environmental choices and not least increase awareness of sustainability among the tourism industry, the local population and our guests. Non-renewable energy sources and emissions from aircraft and boats are the framework we must relate to. Despite many paradoxes and challenges, the destination is working to improve the condition within these scopes.
Many associate “sustainable tourism” with measures to reduce emissions to air and the amount of plastic in the ocean. Yes, looking after the nature and the environment are an important part of the concept of sustainability, but a central part of the understanding is the interaction between the tourism industry, local authorities and the local community. A good place to stay is a good place to visit, and the tourism activities must make a positive contribution. Furthermore, sustainability has an economic perspective. The tourism must contribute to the local community to have something to live by. How we manage our cultural heritage is also part of a sustainable tourism industry. Moreover, all of this must have a long-term perspective.

Some places just care a bit more. About the environment, their unique culture, the local community, and last but not least – your wellbeing. Travel smooth and visit a more sustainable destination on your next adventure.
There are many positive sides to tourism, but the industry is also faced with challenges. If you’re eager to experience a unique destination that can give you memories for life, and also cares for the locals by ensuring that your environmental footprint stays as low as possible, you should visit places in Norway that are labelled as sustainable destinations. Here, you can get more than a beautiful experience, as you also help preserve local communities and cultural heritage while making the destinations an enjoyable place to live and visit.
Please keep in mind, though, that the destinations might not yet be 100 per cent sustainable in every sense, but they are working hard to get better and better every day.
If you seek unforgettable cultural experiences, you can travel to super cosy small towns filled with traditions, such as Røros, Lærdal or the villages in Setesdal.

mby,https://www.mby.com/cruising/exploring-svalbard-dutch-steel-boat-109043 ,"Dag Pike hitches a ride on a 65ft Dutch steel cruiser to explore the glaciers and wildlife of the remote Svalbard archipelago
For most people cruising stops at about 60° north. Head further north and you are trespassing into unfamiliar territory. The temperature drops, the sun never sets, and at certain times of year eerie green lights appear in the sky. Nothing seems normal. The High Arctic seems to operate by a different set of rules. But hereI am cruising close to 80° north, just 1,000 miles from the North Pole.
You know things are different when you step off the plane. It is still broad daylight at midnight and there are people strolling around the arrivals hall with rifles on their shoulders. Once you head outside the towns you are in polar bear country and carrying a rifle is mandatory. The only place you leave your gun outside is at the bank or the supermarket!
There is only one place in the world where you can cruise this far north without having to battle with ice. Svalbard is some 500 miles north of Norway and level with the top of Greenland but is blessed with warm currents from the tail end of the Gulf Stream.
This keeps the archipelago largely ice-free during the summer months, opening up a magical cruising ground. Man has hardly touched this vast area so you are seeing nature in the raw – an awe-inspiring place of mountains, glaciers and fjords that penetrate deep into the heart of the country. The scale of the landscape is huge with even the shoreside mountains rising to over 2,000ft.
Land of the polar bear
There are just three human settlements in this vast land, all on the west side and originally set up to exploit the large coal deposits that encouraged man to settle in this harsh environment. Today that industrial heritage has largely disappeared with the coal only used in the local power station.
Tourism has taken its place but is a summer-only occupation, and during the long winter Svalbard literally shuts down as ice invades the fjords. For three months there is total darkness when the sun never appears above the horizon and temperatures drop down to -20°C. It doesn’t sound like much of a cruising ground but believe me, from someone who has been cruising the world over, Svalbard is a very special place.

Antarctic adventure: Cruising through the Lemaire Channel on FPB 78 Iron Lady
Cruising Norway: Exploring Stavanger Bay and beyond
In our latest feature, Peter Cumberlidge explains why Stavanger Bay is the perfect starting point for boaters interested in cruising
So is the ship I am cruising on. San Gottardo is a converted Dutch fishing boat, just 65ft long but carefully outfitted to ensure reliability and survivability in this unforgiving region. When you leave the main town of Longyearbyen you are on your own.
Just getting here can be a challenge; Svalbard is a three-day journey from the north of Norway across the Barents Sea, and the weather is unpredictable to say the least. Cruising in this virgin territory requires a sound, seaworthy boat and San Gottardo fits the bill perfectly.
Its purpose in life is to take parties of students around the archipelago to see the effects of global warming first hand. It is also used to study the effects of pollution, landing students on remote beaches to collect and monitor the plastic waste.
I went on one of these expeditions and it took us just an hour to fill a large sack with plastic waste from a tiny area. Most of it was fishing debris, nets, ropes and plastic crates. There was also a huge amount of wood, which given that not a single tree grows on Svalbard, must have floated in from elsewhere.
This almost total lack of vegetation takes some getting used to. During the summer the slopes turn a pale imitation of green as plant life tries to establish a presence during the short season but this is soon swept away when winter snows return. The sea freezes over and all boating comes to a halt.
It takes a tough sort of resident to exist through these harsh winters but the wildlife seems to cope. There are more polar bears on Svalbard than people, about 3,000 bears to 2,500 people.
The bears are dangerous and it is mandatory for any landing parties to be accompanied by a trained person with a rifle. If any bears are spotted, you beat a hasty retreat, after all the bears were there first. Walruses are a different matter.
When we anchored for our first night under the lee of Prins Karls Forland, a long uninhabited island that extends down the West Coast, we had no sooner dropped anchor when walruses came alongside to investigate. Maybe they were hopeful of some easy pickings of food but in Svalbard you don’t throw anything over the side.
It did feel strange to land on an uninhabited island and it was our rifle-equipped lookout that spotted the polar bear. It was some distance away but we wasted no time getting back on board.
Time to head off back into Isfjorden, the main fjord that extends over 100 miles inland and provides a magnificent cruising ground that could keep you occupied for a week. We picked a spot in the side fjord of Ymerbukta where a glacier meets the sea.
A constant flow of ice drifted past. In the next fjord, called Trygghamna, a vertical wall of rock soars up to a 2,000ft peak, home to a vast population of guillemots. There was also an old whaling station, a relic from the days when whaling was a big industry here. Today all fishing is banned in the waters around Svalbard.
The final frontier
After a night at anchor we took the tender ashore to get up close and personal with the glacier. This wall of ice, perhaps 100ft high, had taken thousands of years to reach the sea on its long journey from the mountains inland. Explosive bangs heralded the breaking off of sections of ice as it plunged into the sea with an enormous splash.
After the cold of the glacier we headed across Isfjorden to the smaller of the two main coal-mining towns, Barentsburg. It was established by a Russian company and was shelled by the German warship Tirpitz during the Second World War.
Now it is slowly making the transformation from coal mining to a tourist centre with the Norwegian Government investing huge sums of money into a new sports hall and hotel whilst the Russians still try to keep a toe-hold on a place they also lay claim to.
There is even a bust of Lenin in the town square and a Russian pub with a model of a red polar bear and a bar adorned with messages from visiting yachties who have made the long journey north and climbed the 250 steps from the quay to the pub!
After this we returned to Longyearbyen for the night. Longyearbyen was established by American businessman John Munroe Longyear, when he opened a coal mine over 100 years ago. Longyearbyen still has the feel of a frontier town.
All the buildings are made of wood and built on stilts to cope with the permafrost underground. The Norwegian royal yacht was also in the harbour as well as tourist boats running day trips and longer cruises round the archipelago.
On my last day we took a trip up to Templefjord, named after the amazing sand-coloured cliffs that have been weathered into shapes resembling Indian temples. We came up this fjord with a purpose to collect more plastic waste. After the customary polar bear search, it took us just an hour to collect a big bag full which was left for collection by helicopter.
Into the wild
It is difficult to explain the sheer scale of this amazing landscape. We only scratched the surface of Svalbard and apart from the small townships it is wild country with no signs of man ever having been here. In the winter it is all ice and snow but when summer comes this is a fantastic cruising ground.
You need a sound boat and a strong crew because you have to be totally self-sufficient and just getting here involves cruising across 500 miles of open ocean. There are lights on some of the important headlands but they are so remote that there is no guarantee they will be operational.
Even at the entrance to Longyearbyen there are just two buoys marking a dangerous shoal patch. GPS has transformed the navigation around Svalbard and the electronic charts are generally accurate and reliable. The tide has a rise and fall of about 4ft but there can be quite strong currents in some of the narrow channels.
The harbour authorities are helpful and there is limited alongside berthing for visiting craft but anchorages are also available at both of the main ports.
Svalbard may be a challenge for the cruising yacht but it would be well within the capabilities of something like a Nordhavn or other tough displacement trawler yacht. From observations made during my visit it seems that it is mainly sailboats that make this long journey north at present but there is plenty of scope for a long distance motor yacht to visit this enchanting place near the end of the world.
Once here there are day trips in RIBs and other small boats but much better to head off on your own and find some of the remote anchorages that make this archipelago one of the most fascinating cruising grounds in the world.

Its capital Longyearbyen on the main island of Spitsbergen is the world’s most northerly city, some 800 miles inside the Arctic Circle.
Svalbard is also home to some of the Earth’s northernmost glaciers, which bury most of the archipelago’s surface under no less than 200 metres of thick ice. Taken together, Svalbard glaciers represent 6% of the worldwide glacier area outside the large ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica – if they totally melted, they would raise the sea level by 1.7cm.
Because they are so far north, these glaciers are found at relatively low elevations, mostly below 450 metres above sea level compared to 800 metres or more elsewhere in the Arctic. Moreover, they are shaped like domes with steep sides and extensive flat interiors. These peculiar features make Svalbard glaciers highly vulnerable to climate warming, as we discovered in our research now published in Nature Communications.
Firn, the ultimate meltwater buffer
Svalbard has a relatively dry climate, and each year the amount of meltwater exceeds the amount of snowfall that nourishes the glaciers. This was the case even before the climate started to warm in earnest. So how do these glaciers survive such unfavourable conditions?
Their secret is hidden below the surface, in a mantle of cold, compressed snow – called “firn” – that covers the glaciers’ interior. The porous firn layer can be up to 40 metres deep, and acts as a sponge that can store massive amounts of meltwater in its air pockets.
About half of all meltwater produced on Svalbard in the Arctic summer is stored and refrozen in the firn layer, preserving glacial mass by preventing the water from flowing into the ocean. When the glaciers stop melting in winter, the buffer capacity of the firn layer is replenished by the accumulation of fresh, fluffy snow, prepping it to store next summer’s wave of meltwater.
Global warming reaches the far north
Being located at the margin of the rapidly declining sea ice cover in the Arctic Ocean, Svalbard is among the fastest warming regions on Earth. And this warming is testing the limits of the firn layer’s capacity to store meltwater.
Rising air temperature in the mid-1980s considerably increased the amount of water that was melting across the glaciers and rapidly filled the air pockets in the firn, progressively weakening its buffer capacity. To make matters worse, the firn layer retreated fast inland to reach the elevation of 450 metres – a critical point that left more than half of the archipelago’s glacier area unprotected.
The disappearance of firn leaves glaciers without their protective buffer, exposing the underlying dark bare ice at the surface. As dark ice absorbs more sunlight than the brighter firn, melt increased even further.
The rapid retreat of firn in the mid-1980s triggered a period of sustained mass loss, which has been confirmed by satellite observations. The loss of the meltwater buffer makes Svalbard glaciers highly vulnerable to a further temperature rise. In the warm summer of 2013, water reached the ocean from three-quarters of the glacier area, and mass loss more than doubled compared to previous years. In July 2020, Svalbard experienced record high temperatures once again. Some climatologists predict increases of up to 10℃ by the end of this century – if that happens, the archipelago’s glaciers could completely disappear in the next 400 years.
A climate crisis leads to an identity crisis
Further warming will completely reshape Svalbard’s climate, its landscape and its fragile ecosystems. Rain will progressively replace snowfall. Glaciers will trade their white firn mantle for dark ice. Open waters will invade fjords as sea ice and floating glacier tongues retreat. On land, receding glaciers will leave behind moraines and lakes as a reminiscence of a bygone glacial era. The landscape will start to resemble that of Iceland today, with bare rocks surrounded by grass, mosses and shrubs.
The retreating ice will allow increased human activity, including mining, farming and tourism, and further increase the pressure on the wildlife, including the iconic polar bears. Already, polar bears are more frequently sighted on land as the rapid decline in sea ice has forced them to adapt and look for new hunting grounds, endangering both humans and polar bears themselves.
Being located among the fastest warming regions on Earth, Svalbard glaciers are the canary in the coal mine. They can be seen as thermometers monitoring the devastating impacts of the climate crisis. It may not be too late to save part of Svalbard’s glacial landscape and the fragile ecosystems it supports, but time is quickly running out. . There is a fearful irony to recent news of flooding at the Svalbard Global Seed Vault in Norway. This was supposed to be humanity’s most impregnable bulwark against famine, but it is now endangered by global warming, one of the very threats that it was supposed to protect us from.
It is estimated that we have to increase food production by 70% by 2050, and achieve this despite changing weather patterns and the spread of new crop diseases due to global warming. The high-yielding crop varieties which we currently depend on were tailored to produce as much grain as possible under ideal conditions, not for resilience if conditions are less good, such as during flooding or drought.
In nature, species adapt to changing conditions by natural selection acting upon differences between individual organisms. Crop breeders also need variation to work with and this was how the wheat and rice lines of the Green Revolution (which tripled food production in the developing world) were produced, bringing together disease resistance from some varieties, shorter, stronger stems from others and so on.
Feeding the world
We now need to produce a new generation of crops suited to a changing world. Seed banks and other stores of plant diversity are crucial for preserving the range of characteristics that we will need for this challenge.
This contribution of diversity to food security is illustrated by farmers in China, who have often grown traditional types of rice and maize alongside modern high-yield crops as insurance against poor growing conditions. In some years, the traditional varieties have survived droughts that wiped out the modern plants. These farmers’ seeds have now been used in a cross-breeding programme that has produced six new maize lines combining the best properties from more than 200 traditional and newer varieties.
In other cases, a traditional type of rice from Orissa in India was crossed with modern high-yield rice varieties enabling them to survive flooding that would previously have destroyed the crop. A gene for resistance to late blight, the fungal infection responsible for the Great Famine in Ireland, has been found in a wild potato from the grasslands of Argentina and used to make commercial Desiree potatoes resistant to infection.
Wild and traditional crop varieties can even guide the most cutting-edge techniques for crop improvement. The gene editing tool CRISPR-Cas9 is being used to make tomatoes with branching patterns that produce more fruit by taking advantage of a gene from one of its wild relations.
There are about 1,700 seed banks worldwide collecting and protecting this diversity, ranging from small repositories of seeds run by local communities to larger facilities such as the network of stations run by the Russian Vavilov Institute, and Kew’s Millennium Seed Bank in Sussex, which currently contains ten times more samples than the Svalbard vault.
Under threat
However, two seed banks in Afghanistan were looted for the plastic containers in which the seeds were kept, one of the Vavilov Institute facilities has suffered flooding, and another bank in the Philippines was destroyed by typhoon Xangsane.
Because seed banks are being lost to these types of threat – not to mention more mundane reasons such as loss of funding – the Svalbard Seed Vault was established as a global repository and international resource for crop breeders. It has already proved useful. The original International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA) seed bank in Syria has been cut off by conflict since 2012.
It contained many crop varieties bred for arid areas and their wild relatives from the areas where agriculture began in Egypt and Mesopotamia. Fortunately, these stocks were “backed up” at Svalbard and ICARDA was able to withdraw seed to establish a replacement seed bank in Lebanon, the first such withdrawal.
Seeds are a good way to store plant collections because under the right conditions they can remain in “suspended animation” for very long periods. The oldest germinated seed, from a campion flower, was buried in the Siberian tundra more than 30,000 years ago. The previous record holder was a 2,000-year-old date palm seed found at the ancient Jewish fortress of Masada.
These illustrate how cold and dryness help preserve seeds. Larger seed banks follow UN Food and Agriculture Organisation guidelines specifying low temperatures and humidities for seed storage. The Global Seed Vault was located at Svalbard because natural conditions there are cold and dry. The Svalbard vault does use refrigeration to maintain a temperature of -18°C but it was thought that deep within the mountains of Spitzbergen and surrounded by permafrost, seeds stored there would remain frozen even without power. Even if civilisation collapsed.
Thankfully, no seeds were lost because of the flooding at the Svalbard vault and there are other well protected stores – Kew’s Millennium Bank is located inside a nuclear bunker. The Svalbard entrance that was flooded will now be waterproofed, but any water would have had to flow uphill to reach the storage areas, which were in any case well below 0°C which means the water would have frozen first.
Even then, the seeds are protected by foil packages to maintain low humidity, but this is still concerning. Global warming is affecting the poles more than the rest of the world. The temperature ten metres below ground at Svalbard has increased by more than 2°C since 1998 and continues to rise.
It had not been thought that the flooded section needed to be waterproof. Despite global warming, Svalbard will still be a good place to store seed and one of the best places for it to survive a Doomsday scenario in which power for refrigeration is lost. However, in the face of climate change, it may not be as secure as we had hoped. . ",True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False

Active, winter adventures in Svalbard
Svalbard Holidays
Norway’s scenery reaches a crescendo of snowy peaks and glacier-fringed fjords in Spitsbergen – largest of the Svalbard islands, located halfway between Norway and the North Pole. As polar specialists, we can arrange holidays to this spectacular Arctic realm in both summer and winter. Each season holds its own special appeal. Winter heralds the surreal blue glow of the polar night – a mesmerising 24hr twilight that constantly tingles with the possibility of the northern lights. Summer, meanwhile, is midnight sun season, when endless daylight and rising temperatures free the fjords of ice and stimulate an explosion of life – from wildflowers on the tundra to nesting seabirds and prowling polar bears.
Our holidays to Svalbard are as diverse as its seasons. You’ll fly to Longyearbyen, the world’s northernmost town. Based in a choice of comfortable hotels, you can fill your days with anything from snowmobiling, husky sledding, ice caving and snowcat tours in winter, to boat trips, hiking, mountain biking and birdwatching in summer. For aspiring polar explorers, we offer winter snowmobiling adventures to the remote wilderness lodges of Isfjord Radio and Nordenskiold. It’s also possible to combine Svalbard with the city of Tromso on the Norwegian mainland – or you can embark on one of our small-ship polar voyages around Spitsbergen and beyond.

Clinging to the top of a world map, riven by deep fjords and rucked up into an Arctic wilderness of snow-capped peaks and giant glaciers, Svalbard is the realm of polar bear, walrus, reindeer, Arctic fox and prolific birdlife. If wildlife is your main interest, plan to visit in summer: seabird breeding activity reaches its peak by late June or early July, while the best time for polar bear watching is late July to early August when pack ice has retreated enough to allow expedition ships access to prime bear habitat.
A year round destination, Longyearbyen is both the embarkation point for summer polar voyages and an excellent centre for land-based holidays (winter or summer). Its colourful houses resemble Lego blocks scattered along the shores of Adventfjorden. As well as several hotels, restaurants, cafes, shops and a university, the town has an excellent museum with displays on everything from climate change to coal mining. A tour of Mine 7 on the town’s outskirts offers an authentic glimpse into the region’s heritage. You can also visit the world’s most northerly brewery and chocolatier!
Longyearbyen is the starting point for a wide range of guided activities. In summer, hiking, mountain biking and summer dog sledding are available in Advent Valley. You can also join a boat trip or sea kayaking excursion, or venture further afield to the fascinating Russian mining settlement of Barentsburg. In winter, activities include snowcat expeditions to the Longyear Glacier and snowmobiling or husky sledding tours in Advent Valley. An evening excursion to Camp Barentz – a replica of the wooden hut built by Dutch navigator Willem Barentsz in the late 16th century – is a great opportunity to learn about Svalbard’s history, enjoy a traditional dinner and hopefully witness the aurora borealis. .

Linda Crampton is a writer and teacher with an honors degree in biology. She loves to study nature and write about living things.
An Iconic Species
Reindeer are an iconic species. They are beloved by many children for taking Santa around the world on Christmas Eve. After all, without his trusty reindeer pulling his sleigh, Santa couldn't deliver his presents. Unfortunately, some real-life reindeer are showing signs of a potential problem at the moment. The size of the animals is decreasing.
The animals in question are found on an archipelago known as Svalbard, which is part of Norway. Researchers have studied the Svalbard reindeer since 1994. During that time, both the summer and winter temperatures in the area have increased. At the same time, the weight of the reindeer has gradually decreased. The consequences of this weight loss are unknown at the moment, but they could be serious.
Reindeer and North American caribou are closely related. In fact, they have the same scientific name —Rangifer tarandus. They belong to different subspecies within the species tarandus, however.
The Archipelago of Svalbard
People may be familiar with Svalbard for its role in Northern Lights, a fantasy book for young adults written by Philip Pullman. In North America the book is known as The Golden Compass. The tale is set in a parallel universe. It tells the story of a girl named Lyra, who lives in Oxford in England. As part of her heroic exploits, she travels to Svalbard to find her kidnapped uncle, who she eventually discovers is really her father.
In our universe, the Svalbard archipelago is located in the Arctic Ocean and north of the Arctic Circle. This means that there's a period in each year when daylight lasts for twenty-four hours, and another period when night lasts for twenty-four hours.
The islands in the archipelago are known for their expanses of untouched nature. The administrative center of the islands is located in the town of Longyearbyen. The town is located on the largest island of the archipelago, which is named Spitsbergen.
Svalbard doesn't have as cold a climate as might be expected at its latitude. In Longyearbyen, the average winter temperature is said to be -14°C and the average summer temperature is said to be 6°C. It should be noted that these values may not be accurate today, however. The average temperature on the islands is increasing, as described below.

Reindeer Facts
There are some features that all reindeer share, regardless of their subspecies. They belong to the deer family, as their name suggests.
- Reindeer are the only deer in which both males and females bear antlers. Some of the females in a particular population may not develop antlers, however.
- The animals are found in Alaska, northern Canada, Greenland, northern Europe, and northern Asia.
- They live on the tundra or in woodland, depending on the subspecies.
- Reindeer are herbivores.
- They are the only mammals that can see ultraviolet light (as far as we know). This ability allows them to see things that to us are often camouflaged by the blinding white snow. These items include lichens (an important winter food), urine from potential predators or competitors, and the white fur of wolves, which sometimes attack reindeer.
- Their hooves are well adapted for the changing consistency of the ground. The pads on the bottom of the hooves change their features in summer and in winter in order to provide the best traction.
- Some reindeer migrate in the spring. The animals sometimes travel in huge herds over long distances and are good swimmers. Svalbard reindeer are quite sedentary, however.
Santa Claus and Female Svalbard Reindeer
The female Svalbard reindeer is an excellent candidate for the identity of Santa's helpers. Clement Clarke Moore is said to have been the first person to link reindeer with Santa Claus. His classic poem entitled ""A Visit from Saint Nicholas"" was published in 1844. In the poem, he says that Santa's sleigh is pulled by eight tiny reindeer. The only reindeer that could be called tiny in comparison to the other kinds is the Svalbard one. Although both genders of the subspecies are small, the females are significantly smaller than the males.
Male Svalbard reindeer begin the development of their antlers in April and drop them in November or occasionally in early December before Christmas arrives. Females form their new antlers in June and generally keep them until the next June. Therefore it's highly likely that Santa's reindeer are female, since all of the animals pulling his sleigh bear antlers.
When, what to my wondering eyes should appear,
But a miniature sleigh, and eight tiny reindeer,
With a little old driver, so lively and quick,
I knew in a moment it must be St. Nick.
— Clement Clarke Moore
A Curious and Shedding Animal
More Facts About the Animals
- The Svalbard reindeer is the smallest subspecies of reindeer and has the scientific name Rangifer tarandus platyrhynchus.
- The reindeer often look stocky—and sometimes fat—and have short legs. The fat appearance is sometimes due to the presence of thick fur instead of excess body fat, although the animals do put on weight before the winter season.
- The head is smaller in proportion to the body than in other reindeer and is also more rounded.
- In summer, the fur is generally brown on the back and grey on the rest of the body.
- In winter, the entire body often appears grey or even white.
- According to the Norwegian Polar Institute, females have an average weight of about 53 kg in spring and 70 kg in the autumn.
- Males are bigger than females and have an average weight of around 65 kg in the spring and 90 kg in the autumn.
- In summer, the animals spend their time in small groups of three to five animals.
- In October, the reindeer gather in larger groups for mating. A single male chooses around ten females for his harem.
- Large groups of animals may also gather on a good feeding ground in winter.
- The female generally gives birth to a single calf in June.
- Most animals live for about ten years. One individual is known to have reached seventeen years of age, however.
Increasing Temperature in Svalbard
On November 25th, 2016, Ketil Isaksen from the Norwegian Meteorological Institute made a significant announcement. He said that for the first time in recorded history, the average temperature for the year in Svalbard was poised to be around 0°C. Historically, the usual temperature has been around -6.7°C. Isaksen also said that each of the past 73 months had been warmer than average. According to him, ""Svalbard is a very good spot to show what's happening in the Arctic at the moment"".
In March 2018, Kim Holmen of the Norwegian Polar Institute said that the monthly temperature in Longyearbyen had been above average for 86 consecutive months. In 2019, a report created by the Norwegian Meteorological Institute and other organizations predicted that the temperature in Svalbard will continue to rise. Some of the report's specific predictions included increasing air and water temperature, a shorter snow season, and increased rainfall.
Ominously, on July 25th, 2020, the highest-ever temperature was recorded in Svalbard. The temperature in the afternoon was 21.2 degrees Celsius, or 70.2 degrees Fahrenheit, which was the second-highest temperature ever recorded. By the late afternoon, a new record had been established as the temperature reached 21.7 degrees Celsius.
There are still huge areas in the Barents Sea and Kara Sea to the east of Svalbard that are free of ice. They should normally be ice-covered.
— Ketil Isaksen, November 2016
Beautiful Animals in August
A Critical Weight Loss
Scientists have found that the increasing temperature in Svalbard has been accompanied by a decreasing weight in the local reindeer. A common saying in science is some variation of ""correlation doesn't imply causation"". Nevertheless, the correlation in this case could be significant.
Scientists from several institutes have been studying the female reindeer and weighing an average of 135 animals every April. As shown in the quote below, the weight loss in the reindeer from 1994 to 2010 doesn't seem to be especially large. The researchers say that 50 kg is a critical weight for females, however. Below this weight, the animals produce small calves or lose their fetuses. When the calves grow up and mate, they produce lightweight youngsters, too.
The survey shows that over 16 years, the adult reindeers' weight declined by 12% -- from 55kg for those born in 1994 to just over 48kg for those born in 2010.

Animals Near Longyearbyen With Stored Fat
A Changing Climate and a Potential Threat
The lead researcher in the reindeer study thinks that several factors are involved in the decreasing weight of the animals as the temperature rises, as described below.
Most grass growth in Svalbard occurs in June and July. The increased temperatures at this time produce extra plant matter that enables female reindeer to increase in weight relatively quickly. This in turn stimulates the females to collectively conceive more calves when the animals mate in October.
When winter arrives, reindeer are normally able to find plants such as lichens that survive beneath the snow. Though they have fat deposits at the start of winter, their winter food is important for their survival. The warmer temperatures in Svalbard mean that sometimes winter precipitation falls as rain. This freezes on top of the snow and prevents the reindeer from reaching food. As a result of the lower nutrient availability, calves are miscarried or are born with a low birth weight.
There may be another factor at work. Although the reindeer are decreasing in size, their population has doubled over the last twenty years. This may be increasing the competition for food during the winter. It may also mean that individual animals have an inadequate intake of nutrients, which limits their growth.
The researchers are worried that even though a population of small animals may do okay for a while, eventually there will be so much ice on the ground during winter that Svalbard reindeer will experience a dangerous population decline.
The Future for the Reindeer
The outcome of the decreasing weight of the reindeer is unknown at the present. If the temperature continues to rise and the amount of ice on the ground in the winter increases, there may be serious or even catastrophic die-offs in the population due to winter starvation. On the other hand, if the winters become so warm that the rainwater on the ground never freezes, the surviving animals will have access to food in winter and the average size of the animals may gradually increase—if the plants that they need survive the changing climate.
There are many variables involved in the climate problem in Svalbard and many questions that can't be answered yet. For example, the increasing temperature may increase the population of pests and parasites, which could affect the reindeer. Another potential problem is that some plant species may grow abundantly in the warmer climate and crowd out species that are useful for the reindeer.
The situation in Svalbard and in the rest of the Arctic needs to be monitored carefully, for the sake of both the reindeer and humans. Hopefully, the animals will survive for a long time to come. It would be very sad if the weight loss affects the survival of the Svalbard reindeer and very worrying if the problem also affects other subspecies of this iconic animal.

Hi, Genna. Thanks for the comment. Climate change is certainly very worrying. The future is of great concern, especially in the Arctic.
Genna East on December 31, 2016:
What a great article, and timely, too. The Svalbard reindeer are magnificent animals. I was saddened but not surprised about the rising temps and loss of ice in the Barents Sea and Kara Sea to the east of Svalbard and the rest of the Arctic. I wish more people would understand that climate change is not a hoax, and the serious domino effect it brings to all living things.

Thanks for adding this information, Suhail. There's always something interesting in nature to surprise and puzzle us!
Suhail Zubaid aka Clark Kent from Mississauga, ON on December 26, 2016:
Linda,
I just wanted to add this piece after watching a Nature TV's program on wild Africa, yesterday. They were talking about a deer species (springbok) of a particular region, suggesting that its size is becoming shorter and this poses a new problem for the species in summer months.
Therefore, I believe I really need to catch up with this new size to weather correlation ha-ha.
Linda Crampton (author) from British Columbia, Canada on December 24, 2016:
Thank you very much for sharing the facts and your thoughts, Suhail. The situation for polar bears is worrying. I'm watching the news closely. The changing climate in the Arctic is of great concern
Suhail Zubaid aka Clark Kent from Mississauga, ON on December 24, 2016:
Hi Linda,
Thank you for writing an article on an area of my interest - wildlife and environment conservation - if I may.
I knew Svalbard from another wild animal that I like and is going through problems of catastrophic nature due climate change - polar bear.
Because of Svalbard, Norway is included among the 5 countries that are jointly tasked to address the issue of polar bear conservation (USA, Canada, Russia, and Denmark due Greenland are other four).
This size problem in Svalbard reindeer is a new for me. I had never heard of this before. Thanks for enlightening your followers with this little known issue.
I personally think that the size reduction may go in reindeer' favour under the climate change. They may need less fat to protect themselves in extreme winters of the area and offer less body surface for heating up in summers. But then it is me.
Regards,
Suhail

Hi, Martie. Thank you for commenting. It would certainly be different living in Longyearbyen compared to where I live now. I'd love to visit the area, preferably in summer. I hope you have an enjoyable Christmas.
Martie Coetser from South Africa on December 23, 2016:
What a very interesting hub about reindeer! Those antlers are amazing, and even more amazing is that it can be dropped. I'm in awe! Quite impossible to believe that such extraordinary life is spontaneous evolution. Somebody up there must have designed all creatures in detail, I'm sure!
Longyearbyen's summers are as warm as our winters.
Thanks for another very interesting article, Alicia!

Thanks for the great comment, Flourish. I love your wit and humour!
FlourishAnyway from USA on December 23, 2016:
Fascinating facts about their abilities (although so sad that they're encountering this potential threat to their survival).
Now the secret is out that Santa's reindeer were female after all. Who names males Dancer, Prancer, VIXEN, and Cupid? And rumor is that Comet was actually Connie and Donner was actually Donna. (We've misunderstood the lyrics all along.) I hate to say that Blitzen was really named B*tchin'; she was always pesky trouble. Merry Christmas! I'll be watching for Santa and his girls this weekend!
Linda Crampton (author) from British Columbia, Canada on December 23, 2016:
I think that some of them look like Christmas reindeer, too. They are interesting animals. Thanks for the visit, aesta1.
Mary Norton from Ontario, Canada on December 23, 2016:
They remind me of the Christmas reindeer. Now, I know a bit about them when I see them displayed as decors.
Linda Crampton (author) from British Columbia, Canada on December 22, 2016:
Hi, truthfornow. It's interesting that the reindeer change their appearance so significantly. I hope that we can help them, too.

In a very direct-worded statement the foreign ministry says NATO is not needed in the Arctic.
“We strongly believe that there are no problems in the Arctic region that require NATO participation to solve, let alone militarily,” the statement reads.
NATO’s Parliamentary Assembly consists of delegated from the 28 NATO member countries. The Assembly holds different activities bringing together members of parliaments in various formats.
In May, one meeting will take place at Svalbard. Norway has the sovereignty at Svalbard, but the Svalbard Treaty puts certain stipulations, like demilitarisation of the archipelago.
Article 9 prohibits naval bases and fortifications and also the use of Svalbard for war-like purposes.
“Unprecedented military preparations”
“Russia operates based on the premise that all the states that are party to the Spitsbergen [Svalbard] Treaty of 1920 should be interested in ensuring that Spitsbergen remains an archipelago of peace and neighbourliness,” the foreign ministry says.
Moscow claims that the meeting is at odds with the spirit of the Svalbard Treaty.

“In the context of NATO’s current policy of “containing” Russia, accompanied by unprecedented military preparations near the border of our country, the attempts to bring Spitsbergen under the wing of this military-political bloc and to hold its meetings there are at odds with the spirit of the 1920 Treaty. We consider this to be a provocative policy.”
One thing is the location of the meeting; another thing Moscow reacts on is the items to be discussed “the agenda of the seminar includes, among other things, discussing how geopolitics and future of the Arctic are interconnected.”
“Escalation of tension”
“The escalation of tension is not in the long-term interests of the countries of Northern Europe and weakens, rather than strengthens, their security.”
Moscow’s statement comes just ahead of the Norwegian Government’s presentation of its renewed Strategy of the High North, to be made public in Bodø on Friday by Prime Minister Erna Solberg together with Foreign Minister Børge Brende.
Norway, Russia tension over Svalbard has escalated in recent years after Deputy Prime Minister Rogozin made a stop-over at Svalbard in 2015 on his way to Camp Barneo, an annual Russian temporary base on the sea-ice near the North Pole. The visit created an outcry from Norway. Rogozin is on the EU’s and Norway’s sanction list because of conflict involvement in Eastern Ukraine, and is consequently barred entry to Norwegian territory. Svalbard, however, is visa-free zone and Moscow protested Norway’s attempt to restrict any Russian citizens an undisputed right to visit the archipelago.
Chechen Special Forces
Last year, Chechen Special Forces used Longyearbyen airport for transportation of personnel and equipment for an airborne drill near Camp Barneo.
Cargo and other personnel were brought to Camp Barneo by a Russian plane from Longyearbyen. The Chechen delegation was lead by Ramzan Kadyrov’s aide on law enforcement issues Daniil Martynov.
The Norwegian Government in its White paper on Svalbard explains that “All foreign military activity in Svalbard is prohibited and would entail a gross infringement of sovereignty.”
Climate change on agenda
NATO Parliamentary Assembly writes in a note that the Svalbard meeting, to take place on May 9-10, aims at discuss impact of climate changes, maritime cooperation and trade and business opportunities in the High North. The seminar is organized in cooperation with the Norwegian Parliament (Storting), and is part of the Parliamentary Assembly’s ongoing focus on environmental security and developments in the High North.
“The potential for an ice-free Arctic Ocean this century will open the region to shorter global transit routes. As such, the Seminar will focus on new challenges and opportunities for the region, as well as the existing good international cooperation within maritime and environmental affairs, joint search and rescue efforts, and the high North as an area for constructive international cooperation in general.”
Some 100 participants, including 58 parliamentarians from 18 NATO member states and partner countries will participate at Svalbard.
NATO Parliamentary Assembly underlines that it is independent from NATO and has no direct role in NATO policies or operations.
2012 NATO meeting
Next month’s meeting is, however, not the first time a delegation from NATO’s Parliamentary Assembly visits Svalbard. In May 2012, 26 NATO parliamentarians spent four days on the archipelago to learn more about how strategic changes are affecting the Arctic region.
The visit to this Arctic Archipelago provided a unique opportunity for the parliamentarians to meet with Norwegian and international experts working on a wide range of Arctic challenges,” the parliamentarians reported after the tour.
Questions Norway’s historic rights
The NATO meeting this spring now triggers widespread coverage in Russian media.
Analysing the meeting, RIA Novosti commentator Aleksandr Khrolenko points to historic Russian population on Svalbard “these islands were populated by Russian Pomor settles,” he writes in a text that in-between the lines questions Norway’s historic rights. Since the Russian settlers, according to a 1569 map, were on the archipelago, it “has been controlled by the Netherlands, the UK, Denmark, Sweden and finally, independent Norway.”
RIA Novosti is a news agency operating under the purview of the Russian Ministry of Communications and Mass Media. Under a presidential decree signed by Putin in December 2013, the news agency became a part of Rossiya Segodnya. According to the decree, the mandate of Rossiya Segodnya is to “Provide information on Russian state policy and Russian life and society for audiences abroad.”
Sputnik News, another arm of Rossiya Segodnya, on Thursday published an English version of the statements questioning Norway’s historic rights over Svalbard.
Military base at Fraz Josef Land
Further northeast of Svalbard in the Barents Sea is Russia’s Franz Josef Land. Here, the world’s northernmost military complex was recently opened at the Nagurskoye base on Aleksandra Island. Visited by President Vladimir Putin, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and Minister of Defense Sergei Shoygu last month, the complex provide living and working conditions for up to 150 soldiers. A nearby military airfield is upgraded.
When construction work at the base started in 2014, Defense Minister Sergei Shoygu said one of the prioritized areas for the military is development of military infrastructure in the Arctic.
«A constant military presence in the Arctic and a possibility to protect the state’s interest by military means are regarded as an integral part of the general policy to guarantee national security,» Shoygu said as previously reported by the Barents Observer.

These greenhouse gases will then contribute to further climate changes, causing more Arctic permafrost to melt. Such self-reinforcing cycle, called the permafrost carbon feedback, is now studied at several locations at Svalbard.
“When I started studying permafrost in the late 1990s, I didn’t think this was something I was going to experience,” says Ketil Isaksen, Senior Researchers at the Norwegian Meteorological Institute.
“Core samples from Janssonhaugen shows an increase in temperatures of more than 2°C at a depth of 10 meters. Measurements of the temperatures show a steady increase over the last 20 years,” Isaksen tells.
The researchers have made one drilling to 102 meters depth and another 15 meters down in the permafrost.
“This summer has been extreme,” Isaksen says, pointing to the temperatures measured every summer since 1899.
Average temperatures for June, July and August have varied from year. Until about 1990, this variation was typically 0,5 to 1°C with some single years 1,5°C over or under the normal.
In the 1990s, a clear change was observed, and after 1997 the researchers have not registered a single summer with a mean temperature under the normal.

The summers are getting warmer and warmer and 2020 was exceptional. New all-time high was measured at Longyearbyen airport on July 25 with 21,7°C.
Permafrost at Svalbard has entered the era of megamelt, and together with Russia’s Arctic coast, no other places on the earth warms faster. Also the sea ice in the surrounding Arctic Ocean experiences melting at a rate much faster than previous climate models predicted.
As of September 1, Arctic sea ice extent stood at 4,26 million square kilometers, the second lowest extent for that date in the satellite recordings that started in 1979, according to the National Snow & Ice Data Center.
International climate scientists are following developments on Svalbard with scare. Permafrost contains twice as much carbon as the atmosphere, and with thawing permafrost, more and more of the CO2 and methane are emitted as the organic material previously frozen start to decompose.
Releasing of carbon from the permafrost will contribute additionally to warming climate. . ",True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False

Svalbard Tourism: Best of Svalbard
Start planning for Svalbard
Create a Trip to save and organise all of your travel ideas, and see them on a map . We went on a 7 hours dog sledge trip with Green Dog and the guide Timon, Friday March 6th. 2015. We had a lovely day in the fantastic winter wonderland surroundings in Bolterdalen. The dogs Nuna, Eagle, Hendrix, Amna, Lynx and Raptor took us safely to the magnificent icecaves. We climbed into the icecave and what a fantastic view! I have never seen anything like this in my hole life... Wow! Timon was a very good guide and his way of treating the dogs was good for a animal lover to see.
I really recommend this trip to everybody. Nice, quite, peacefull, lovely nature... what more can I say... Go for it, you will never regret. I would go back tomorrow if I could!
- . It’s hard to find the words to describe just how amazing Svalbard is, and how the Funken Lodge makes the trip perfect; but I’ll try!
You don’t just visit Svalbard; you experience it. Svalbard reminds me of a sci-fi B movie in the best way - with its power station, disused mines and the famous “doomsday” global seed vault.
The scenery will blow your socks off, especially on a clear winter’s day with the gorgeous Arctic light.
Hiking to an ice cave, dog sledding, snow-mobiling, a bus tour - all the arctic favourites plus some new experiences are here on this strategically vital archipelago.
By the way - if you travel in winter please be aware of the cold - I’ve been in -40 and the wind here is even more savage, merciless and punishing, even if it’s “only” -25!
Good thermal bottoms and tops, gloves, socks and hats plus hand and foot warmers are essential.
I saw the Northern Lights for the sixth time too, which was wonderful.
Funken is in my view, the hotel jewel in the crown on Svalbard. It oozes relaxed, dignified class and superb comfort. It is also just a 10-15 walk (max) from Longyearbyen’s main street so is nice and quiet.
The decor is beautiful, of understated and high quality as you’d expect in Scandinavia.
Funken’s dining room, with its wonderful mountain view and huge windows, is very relaxing and the breakfast buffet is delicious. Staff efficiently and quietly attend to everyone, serving that lovely Norwegian coffee.
The gym is superbly equipped - and I say that as a personal trainer! The bar area is very relaxing with some wonderful music (thanks to the Shazam app I’m going to download some of it!) where I relaxed and read my book.
My room was quietly well-appointed and the bed is supremely comfortable. The bathroom is top quality and you get free moisturising cream due to Svalbard’s dry climate; a great touch.
The best thing though, is the staff, especially Victor (told you I’d mention you buddy!), Sergei (thank you for serving me the tea!) and Sara. There is also a chap from Brazil, I didn’t get his name but like all the staff he’s helpful, cheerful, friendly and professional. The staff make you feel special; but it is they who are top class.
What a journey. Thank you, Funken Lodge. For me, in my third Arctic odyssey, this was an absolutely faultless experience and Funken represents the standards to which all hotels should meet.
Ten out of ten all day long. Brilliant. . ",True,False,True,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False
cgiar,https://www.cgiar.org/cgiar-genebank-platform/ ,"The activities of the CGIAR Genebank Platform (GENEBANK) in 2018 were targeted specifically to bring about increased conservation and use of genetic resources with the aim of achieving CGIAR System Level Outcomes (SLOs) and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
The work of GENEBANK directly contributes to indicator 2.5.1 of SDG Target 2.5, which aims to “maintain the genetic diversity of seeds, cultivated plants and farmed and domesticated animals and their related wild species, including through soundly managed and diversified seed and plant banks … and promote access to and fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the utilization of genetic resources and associated traditional knowledge”.
In 2018, a total of 96,566 germplasm samples (66,930 accessions) were distributed by the CGIAR genebanks to users. Of these, 56,393 (58%) were distributed to recipients outside CGIAR in 87 countries and 40,173 samples (42%) were provided to CRPs. For the second year in a row, germplasm distribution outside the CGIAR exceeded that inside CGIAR.
Table 14 shows germplasm numbers for 2017 and 2018. It shows that the percentage of samples delivered outside of CGIAR was higher in 2018 (58%) than in 2017 (56%). It also shows that developing countries received a larger proportion of germplasm in 2018 (77%) compared to 2017 (67%).
Figure 4 presents a summary of germplasm distributions for 2018 (GENEBANK, 2018).
By the end of 2018, CGIAR genebanks were managing 773,112 accessions, including 25,576 in vitro accessions and 32,212 accessions held as plants or trees in screenhouses or fields. Approximately 80% of total accessions are immediately available for international distribution. Of the seed accessions, 57% is secured in safety duplication at two levels and 78% is duplicated at the Svalbard Global Seed Vault (SGSV). 72% of clonal crop collections is safety duplicated in the form of cryopreserved or in vitro cultures.
Progress is being made in upgrading collections and strengthening quality management systems (QMS) of both genebanks and germplasm health units (GHUs). More than 156 standard operating procedures have been drafted and genebank procedures for acquisition, distribution, conservation, regeneration and characterization have been audited and will be externally validated in 2019 and 2020.

It was designed as an impregnable deep-freeze to protect the world’s most precious seeds from any global disaster and ensure humanity’s food supply forever. But the Global Seed Vault, buried in a mountain deep inside the Arctic circle, has been breached after global warming produced extraordinary temperatures over the winter, sending meltwater gushing into the entrance tunnel.
The vault is on the Norwegian island of Spitsbergen and contains almost a million packets of seeds, each a variety of an important food crop. When it was opened in 2008, the deep permafrost through which the vault was sunk was expected to provide “failsafe” protection against “the challenge of natural or man-made disasters”.
But soaring temperatures in the Arctic at the end of the world’s hottest ever recorded year led to melting and heavy rain, when light snow should have been falling. “It was not in our plans to think that the permafrost would not be there and that it would experience extreme weather like that,” said Hege Njaa Aschim, from the Norwegian government, which owns the vault.
“A lot of water went into the start of the tunnel and then it froze to ice, so it was like a glacier when you went in,” she told the Guardian. Fortunately, the meltwater did not reach the vault itself, the ice has been hacked out, and the precious seeds remain safe for now at the required storage temperature of -18°C.
But the breach has questioned the ability of the vault to survive as a lifeline for humanity if catastrophe strikes. “It was supposed to [operate] without the help of humans, but now we are watching the seed vault 24 hours a day,” Aschim said. “We must see what we can do to minimise all the risks and make sure the seed bank can take care of itself.”
The vault’s managers are now waiting to see if the extreme heat of this winter was a one-off or will be repeated or even exceeded as climate change heats the planet. The end of 2016 saw average temperatures over 7°C above normal on Spitsbergen, pushing the permafrost above melting point.
“The question is whether this is just happening now, or will it escalate?” said Aschim. The Svalbard archipelago, of which Spitsbergen is part, has warmed rapidly in recent decades, according to Ketil Isaksen, from Norway’s Meteorological Institute.
“The Arctic and especially Svalbard warms up faster than the rest of the world. The climate is changing dramatically and we are all amazed at how quickly it is going,” Isaksen told Norwegian newspaper Dagbladet.
The vault managers are now taking precautions, including major work to waterproof the 100m-long tunnel into the mountain and digging trenches into the mountainside to channel meltwater and rain away. They have also removed electrical equipment from the tunnel that produced some heat and installed pumps in the vault itself in case of a future flood.
Aschim said there was no option but to find solutions to ensure the enduring safety of the vault: “We have to find solutions. It is a big responsibility and we take it very seriously. We are doing this for the world.”
“This is supposed to last for eternity,” said Åsmund Asdal at the Nordic Genetic Resource Centre, which operates the seed vault. . This story originally appeared on the Guardian and is part of the Climate Desk collaboration.

Location: Norway
Date Established: Beginning in 1973
Size: Over 60 percent of Svalbard is protected land.
Did You Know?
• Seven Parks The Svalbard Islands, an Arctic Ocean archipelago halfway between mainland Norway and the North Pole, are home to seven Norwegian national parks: Forlandet, Indre Wijdefjorden, Nordenskiöld Land, Nordre Isfjorden, Nordvest-Spitsbergen, Sassen-Bünsow Land, and Sør-Spitsbergen.
• Beware of Bears Svalbard is Arctic wilderness and polar bear country. The opportunity to see one of these giants draws many visitors. But polar bears can be dangerous, and close encounters may prove fatal for the bears and, occasionally, for humans. People traveling in bear country are advised to carry flares or other deterrents to scare off aggressive bears—and high-powered rifles in case such measures fail.
• Nordvest-Spitsbergen Nordvest-Spitsbergen National Park is a glorious land of mountain peaks, glaciers, and offshore islands. It is also home to Svalbard’s main historical monuments. Whaling stations and burial grounds were established here as early as the 1600s. The ill-fated balloonist Salomon Andrée took off from Virgohamn for the North Pole in July 1897. His remains, and those of his companions, weren’t found until 1930. Visiting the remnants of his camp, and other sites on Virgohamn, requires a permit from the governor.
• Forlandet Forlandet National Park, established in 1973, covers all of the island of Prins Karls Forland and features high mountains, small glaciers, and a sizeable coastline. Geese and eider ducks nest here and walruses can be seen along the water’s edge. The park is also home to the world’s northernmost harbor seal population.
• Indre Wijdefjorden Indre Wijdefjorden National Park is dominated by its namesake fjord, the longest in Svalbard, which stretches from the sea back to an inland glacial front. On either side of the fjord rare Arctic steppe vegetation can be found—including plant species not known elsewhere in Europe.
• Sassen-Bünsow Land Sassen-Bünsow Land National Park has large stretches of wetlands and Arctic vegetation—an enticing landscape for the many birds that live here. Perhaps the most legendary figure of Svalbard’s rich hunting history, Hilmar Nøis, also lived here, at Fredheim. Visitors can see the base station where he spent many of his 38 Svalbard winters between 1909 and 1973.
How to Get There
Svalbard is remote and no regular boats run between mainland Norway and the islands. The airport in Longyearbyen, capital of the islands, has regular connections to Oslo (2 hours and 50 minutes) and Tromsø (1 hour and 40 minutes).
- Nat Geo Expeditions
When to Visit
As its Arctic Ocean location would suggest, Svalbard is a land of long, cold winters with extended periods of temperatures from -4 to -22ºF (-20 to -30ºC)—not including wind chill. Between December and May visitors can explore the islands by skis, snowmobiles, or dog sleds. Boating is possible from early June until mid-September.
How to Visit
Cruising is a very popular way to visit Svalbard. A wide range of accommodations and itineraries are available. Private cruise lines provide easy and comfortable transport across large distances of Arctic wilderness and stop at a variety of landing sites for exploration of Svalbard’s natural and historic wonders. During the relatively mild Arctic summer and autumn, many visitors combine boat and kayak trips with exploratory hikes around the island to enjoy the explosion of flowering plants and verdant mosses and vegetation. . Creating a Vision for Sustainable Arctic Communities
The community of Longyearbyen is a key port in Norway’s Svalbard islands with a fast-growing tourism industry, but it attracts few permanent residents. In Longyearbyen, there are no indigenous people, and those residents who brave the isolation and extreme environment still cannot privately own land. But this Arctic town may offer insights on resilience to other places like it that are facing the effects of climate change. (See related interactive map: The Changing Arctic.)
I have been in the Arctic on many exploratory and scientific outdoor trips over the past 15 years, from guiding ski mountaineering and ski trips in Norway, Canada and Alaska to crossing Iceland by skis and kataraft while collecting water samples for a project. My experience of the Arctic as a scientist, expedition guide, and photographer has developed my deep appreciation for its beauty, its wildness, its dangers, and its vulnerability.
Wanting to better understand this complex environment, I undertook research to examine communities in both the Arctic and the Swiss Alps: two regions vulnerable to climate change and dependent on few economic sectors, with tourism being a major part of their local economies. (Take the quiz: “Energy in the Changing Arctic.”)
The Arctic: The Science of Change
Learn more about the issues surrounding a changing region.
Learn more about the issues surrounding a changing region.
In the ArcAlpNet project, we used surveys, interviews and other tools to take a closer look at social networks in Longyearbyen and three communities in the Swiss Alps. In Longyearbyen, the economy is based on coal mining; a research university center and research in general; and the growing tourism industry. Most tourism industry staff go there for adventure and quick money, while only a few business owners have been living there for longer periods of 20 to 40 years.
One consequence of this transience is a lack of attachment to the place—potential engagement with a place one cares for, a kind of mental ownership that would drive people to take responsibility for a sustainable future. Such individual and collective engagement is the prerequisite to striving for resilience and a sustainable future.
Collaboration and resilience
Despite the population’s transient nature, the social collaboration network of Longyearbyen reveals one important pathway to resilience: the high turnover of people and the compartmentalization of the community into sub-groups may enable innovation through the influx and incubation of diverse new ideas. The town’s Alpine counterparts, in contrast, have more stable and dense social networks, but are more at risk of “group think” and resistance to new ideas.
Longyearbyen’s form of resilience comes at a cost: less-coordinated planning, and the potential for short-term visions to be at odds with a long-term ecologically sustainable economy. The lack of a common vision or functional leadership in Longyearbyen leads to low collaboration on long-term action and more structural changes, and prevents the implementation of necessary innovation for sustainability.
A renewable energy vision for Arctic communities
To develop resilience, Longyearbyen should increase strategic and long-term collaboration through joint networking initiatives, and develop common values and a vision that may help to increase attachment to the town; this may then lead to more engagement in local sustainable development.
But what could such a vision likely be? Strengthening resilience of the community while designing a sustainable way of living and thriving in the Arctic may be such a vision, but this goal is rather abstract. Energy is at the forefront of the sustainability discussion, and it is especially relevant to the Arctic and its communities, given the extreme living conditions and increasing interest from multinational energy companies in extracting the region’s resources. This rising demand will put new pressures on highly vulnerable Arctic ecosystems, and any development must be undertaken with the greatest possible care.
Longyearbyen’s economy is already rooted in energy production, thanks to its long history as a producer of coal. Though the community’s energy comes exclusively from the coal mined there, 70 percent of its production is exported mainly to fuel high-tech steel production in Central Europe, especially in Germany, because the coal is of such a high quality and carbon density that it is worth the export.
But coal’s high emissions and its changing fortunes as an economic commodity raise the question about the potential for renewable energy and greater efficiency in the Arctic. What is the potential for energy-efficient lifestyles in combination with renewable energy production to serve as a model for the possible development paths of Arctic indigenous and non-indigenous communities?
Blueprinting Arctic communities of the future?
What can we learn from resilience of a community like Longyearbyen that, to a major extent, exists for business and fun? Does the increasing global pressure for energy and tourism push indigenous communities into a similar direction of developing tourism, employing research, and opening wide areas for resource extraction—thus making Longyearbyen something of a blueprint for future Arctic communities? Where are the threats and where are the opportunities for anticipating change and driving resilience in other Arctic indigenous communities?
Further research is needed to examine the resilience features of indigenous Arctic communities, applying the same network-based resilience assessment methodology as in the ArcAlpNet project. Comparing such results with those found in the comparison of Longyearbyen with three communities in the European Alps can help shed light on the Arctic community developments of the future.

The community of Longyearbyen is a key port in Norway’s Svalbard islands with a fast-growing tourism industry, but it attracts few permanent residents. In Longyearbyen, there are no indigenous people, and those residents who brave the isolation and extreme environment still cannot privately own land. But this Arctic town may offer insights on resilience to other places like it that are facing the effects of climate change. (See related interactive map: The Changing Arctic.)
I have been in the Arctic on many exploratory and scientific outdoor trips over the past 15 years, from guiding ski mountaineering and ski trips in Norway, Canada and Alaska to crossing Iceland by skis and kataraft while collecting water samples for a project. My experience of the Arctic as a scientist, expedition guide, and photographer has developed my deep appreciation for its beauty, its wildness, its dangers, and its vulnerability.
Wanting to better understand this complex environment, I undertook research to examine communities in both the Arctic and the Swiss Alps: two regions vulnerable to climate change and dependent on few economic sectors, with tourism being a major part of their local economies. (Take the quiz: “Energy in the Changing Arctic.”)

In the ArcAlpNet project, we used surveys, interviews and other tools to take a closer look at social networks in Longyearbyen and three communities in the Swiss Alps. In Longyearbyen, the economy is based on coal mining; a research university center and research in general; and the growing tourism industry. Most tourism industry staff go there for adventure and quick money, while only a few business owners have been living there for longer periods of 20 to 40 years.
One consequence of this transience is a lack of attachment to the place—potential engagement with a place one cares for, a kind of mental ownership that would drive people to take responsibility for a sustainable future. Such individual and collective engagement is the prerequisite to striving for resilience and a sustainable future.
Collaboration and resilience
Despite the population’s transient nature, the social collaboration network of Longyearbyen reveals one important pathway to resilience: the high turnover of people and the compartmentalization of the community into sub-groups may enable innovation through the influx and incubation of diverse new ideas. The town’s Alpine counterparts, in contrast, have more stable and dense social networks, but are more at risk of “group think” and resistance to new ideas.
Longyearbyen’s form of resilience comes at a cost: less-coordinated planning, and the potential for short-term visions to be at odds with a long-term ecologically sustainable economy. The lack of a common vision or functional leadership in Longyearbyen leads to low collaboration on long-term action and more structural changes, and prevents the implementation of necessary innovation for sustainability.
A renewable energy vision for Arctic communities
To develop resilience, Longyearbyen should increase strategic and long-term collaboration through joint networking initiatives, and develop common values and a vision that may help to increase attachment to the town; this may then lead to more engagement in local sustainable development.
But what could such a vision likely be? Strengthening resilience of the community while designing a sustainable way of living and thriving in the Arctic may be such a vision, but this goal is rather abstract. Energy is at the forefront of the sustainability discussion, and it is especially relevant to the Arctic and its communities, given the extreme living conditions and increasing interest from multinational energy companies in extracting the region’s resources. This rising demand will put new pressures on highly vulnerable Arctic ecosystems, and any development must be undertaken with the greatest possible care.
Longyearbyen’s economy is already rooted in energy production, thanks to its long history as a producer of coal. Though the community’s energy comes exclusively from the coal mined there, 70 percent of its production is exported mainly to fuel high-tech steel production in Central Europe, especially in Germany, because the coal is of such a high quality and carbon density that it is worth the export.
But coal’s high emissions and its changing fortunes as an economic commodity raise the question about the potential for renewable energy and greater efficiency in the Arctic. What is the potential for energy-efficient lifestyles in combination with renewable energy production to serve as a model for the possible development paths of Arctic indigenous and non-indigenous communities?

sciencedaily,https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/02/170207104356.htm ,"The energy supply to Longyearbyen, midway between continental Norway and the North Pole, is a hot topic in the climate debate.
Longyearbyen is the largest settlement and the administrative centre of Svalbard, a Norwegian archipelago in the Arctic Ocean. Today, Longyearbyen obtains its electric power and district heating from its coal power plant, the only one in Norway.
This plant produces annual emissions of 40 tonnes of CO2 per inhabitant, four times as much as those per mainland inhabitant, even including those generated by the oil industry. This situation has led to reactions from both environmentalists and politicians.
Shipping surplus energy northwards
In the course of the debate about sustainable alternatives, some politicians have already been speaking warmly about replacing Longyearbyen's coal power plant with a cable between the city and mainland Norway: a 1000-km undersea cable capable of bringing surplus wind- and hydro-power to the country's outpost in the far north.
A recent study carried out by SINTEF has shown that shipping surplus energy to Svalbard in the form of liquid hydrogen rather than via a cable could mean annual savings of more than NOK 100 million (USD 11.5 million).
The estimated costs include the construction of an electrochemical power station in Longyearbyen. A plant of this type would generate electricity from hydrogen without emissions, by means of fuel cells (see fact-box).
Wide-ranging energy discussion recommended
The ABB energy company estimates that a single cable to the mainland would cost NOK 3 billion (USD 345 million), while a more supply-reliable double cable would come to BNOK 5 (USD 575 million).
For the price of power supplied by a cable to fall to the level of hydrogen-based power, a cable would also have to supply electricity to offshore installations in the Barents Sea, says SINTEF's project manager Anders Ødegård. Several participants in the debate have made the same point.
""But Svalbard needs a long-term solution. It would not be sensible to depend on oil platforms with a lifetime of only a few decades. Our results make it clear that it is important to discuss Svalbard's future energy supply on a broad basis and not settle on a cable as the only possible zero-emissions solution,"" says Ødegård.
Geothermal energy and green coal power
In one of SINTEF' scenarios for the future, Svalbard will supply some energy itself by producing solar power during the summer. As winter approaches, more and more electricity will be generated from hydrogen transported from the mainland.
Ødegård emphasises that any further discussion of Svalbard's future energy situation should also include other alternatives, such as geothermal energy and continued coal-fired electricity generation, with carbon capture and storage.
""The Longyearbyen power station has recently been upgraded to extend its lifetime by 20 years. In a climate perspective, it would be unthinkable to continue with the current level of emissions for such a long time, which is why it is essential to put Svalbard's energy supply on the agenda now,"" says Ødegård.
Fuel from water; of course it is possible
Hydrogen, which is thus a central topic of the new SINTEF study, is a fuel that could be used by both power stations and vehicles. The energy-rich element is not a source of energy as such, but rather an energy carrier.
This is because electrical energy can be stored in the form of hydrogen by passing it through a system that splits water into hydrogen and oxygen.
If the electrical energy used in such hydrogen generation plants is, for example, wind- or hydro-power, the energy chain will be green in its entirety. This is because power plants and vehicles that use hydrogen emit only pure water.
Electricity bills could be cut by more than NOK 100 million a year
If all of Longyearbyen's electric power were to be generated in a hydrogen power station, it would cost one krone (about € 0.11; USD 0.12) less per kilowatt-hour than power supplied by cable, according to the estimates that the report's authors regard as most realistic.
""If we combine imported hydrogen and local solar power, Svalbard would save a further NOK 0.20 per kWh,"" says Ødegård. At current levels of energy consumption, implementing both solutions would mean that Longyearbyen's total annual electricity bill would be more than MNOK 100 (USD 11.5 million) lower if hydrogen is used in preference to a cable-based solution.
The door closes on wind-energy
On Norway's northernmost territory, coal mining has reached its final stages.
""We have assumed that Svalbard will replace mining with new industries of about the same overall dimensions. For that reason, we have based the whole of this study on current levels of consumption,"" says Jonas Martin, a German economics student and SINTEF trainee, who has been responsible for performing the calculations under the guidance of SINTEF scientists with long experience in this area.
The study is also looking at the possibility of meeting Svalbard's electricity requirements by installing wind turbines. However, this solution would be more expensive than cable power, and in any case, would scarcely be acceptable on environmental grounds (see Fact-box 3).
Hydrogen offers flexibility
The MNOK 100 saving is based on a hydrogen price of about NOK 35 (USD 4) per kilo, CIF Longyearbyen.
""We regard this as a realistic price on the basis of consultations with a number of Norwegian suppliers. However, our study shows that hydrogen would be competitive with cable power even at prices up to around NOK 65 (USD 7.5) per kilo,"" says Ødegård.
""Major but feasible effort required""
At Fantoft, just outside Bergen, Vegard Frihammer heads the energy company Greenstat, which aims to become a national leader in hydrogen production. Frihammer's company has analysed that hydrogen produced at the Mongstad oil refinery on the west coast of Norway would cost about NOK 22 (USD 2.50) per kilo.
""Like SINTEF, we are working on a number of studies regarding the liquefaction and transport of hydrogen. But in these areas, there are no public figures we can refer to yet,"" says Frihammer.
What he does know, however, is what Norwegian suppliers of hydrogen will need to be prepared for in order to be price-competitive.
""We have had good indications from Japan that companies that want to supply the country with hydrogen will need to price their product between about NOK 20 (USD 2.30) and NOK 45 (USD 5.20) per kg at the quay (CIF). Our aim is that in 2030, green hydrogen from Norway should cost NOK 30 (USD 3.45) per kg, CIF Japan. This will involve a major effort throughout the value chain, but it ought to be within reach. And if we can reach this goal for supplying Japan, NOK 30 should be a realistic price on Svalbard too.""

climatechangenews,https://www.climatechangenews.com/2016/11/22/melting-arctic-its-a-very-different-svalbard/ ,"It has been an autumn like no other, says Kim Holmén international director of the Norwegian Polar Institute, from his office in Longyearbyen.
“It is about 10C above the normal for this time of the year. And plenty of rain throughout October and November, which is unusual at best,” says Holmén. “Today it is minus two, which is balmy for this time of year. But it is just a few days since we’ve had the first freezing event.”
Reports of wildly abnormal weather and ice conditions across the Arctic have resulted in a blizzard of graphs and reports in recent weeks. For residents of the main settlement on the Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard, the weirdness reverberates through the community, causing fear and uncertainty.
Ice in Svalbard is an integral part of ecosystems, society, even the land itself. But this year, it has failed utterly. By November, the great arms of the Arctic sea ice would normally have wrapped the archipelago in its crushing, cracking embrace. But the ice fringe remains hundreds of kilometres to the north.
Weekly briefing: Sign up for your essential climate politics update
“It is a very different Svalbard that we are seeing now. The fjord doesn’t freeze and there were people fishing for cod just last week still; and that the cod themselves are in the fjord is an indication of a warmer ocean,” says Holmén.
Instead of bitterly cold wind driven across the ice, the sea is governing the weather in Svalbard; bringing rain, rain and more rain. Between October 2015 and October 2016, the island was hit by 64% more rain than normal.
That doesn’t account for a storm on 8 November in which nearly three times the monthly average fell in a single day.
The glaciers, which grow through the late autumn and winter are still retreating and the rain breaks the ice apart. Warm water seeps into the land, exacerbating the melting in the soil.
After the last storm, a portion of Longyearbyen was evacuated because of fears of a landslide. Last December, a man was killed when an avalanche buried about 10 houses.
“People are worried and disturbed,” says Holmén. All those living on Svalbard are migrants, there is no indigenous population. Holmén hints that this may mean they might be less likely to cling on in the face of change.
“Certainly [they] feel it very strongly under their skin that this is not good. I think there are some people that are considering if it is worthwhile to continue being here.”
Residents await the results of a Norwegian government report into the changing landscape. It may decide that some parts of the town are unsafe and have to be moved. “It certainly will be a tremendously costly and painful process,” says Holmén.
Although, he adds, at least some residents welcome the changes. There is the prospect of new industries, such as a year-round cod fishery or the arrival of the lucrative snow crabs from the south.
But for many of the species that rely on the ice, this competition from warmer climes is a death knell. Arctic bird species are plummeting in number as they are out-matched by southerners.
The effect on the islands’ famous polar bears is uncertain because the population is still rebounding since a hunting ban was put in place in 1973.
Some species will cling for while to the disappearing glacier faces, says Holmén: “There is no land north of us. There is nowhere to migrate towards if the climate changes such that their specialisation rather than a competitive advantage becomes a loss compared to the temperate species that are moving in.
“So we are seeing the Atlantification of Svalbard. For the specialised species it is grim because the areas with that type of habitat are diminishing.”

Svalbard is a Norwegian group of islands located in the Arctic Ocean north of continental Norway, about 650 miles (1,050 kilometers) from the North Pole. It is the northernmost year-round settlement on Earth, with a population of about 2,200. Recently, Svalbard has been trying to move its economy more toward tourism and scientific research, and away from coal mining, which supported much of the economy since the early 20th century. Tourist visits to Svalbard have been steadily rising, with amazing views and abundant wildlife—especially the polar bears—drawing visitors from around the world.

Get ready to enter a surreal Noah’s Ark of seeds, because deep inside a mountain on a remote island in the Svalbard archipelago, halfway between mainland Norway and the North Pole lies the Svalbard Global Seed Vault.
The fight against species extinction and disease has many fronts. Safeguarding everything from sheep food to chilli peppers, the seed storage facility is built to withstand natural and manmade disasters. It has the capacity to store 4.5 million crop varieties inside a sandstone mountain high above sea level, where the permafrost that will ensure that the carefully packaged seeds remain below the required -18°C for several weeks, even if there is a power failure.
Currently, the vault holds more than one million samples, ranging from unique varieties of African and Asian food staples such as maize, rice, wheat, cowpea, and sorghum to European and South American varieties of eggplant, lettuce, barley, and potato. The vault already holds the most diverse collection of food crop seeds in the world and is an insurance policy for the world’s food supply. It costs US$625 invested today to conserve a single crop variety in an international collection. Many seeds can survive for several hundred years and select grains far longer than that.
“Your chapatti, your tortilla, your slice of bread, your sushi, your morning coffee, your afternoon tea, your evening soup, your nightcap, even your meat – almost everything you eat and drink has its basis in seeds.” – Marie Haga, Former Executive Director, Global Crop Diversity Trust
The seed vault is built 150 metres deep into the mountain and more than 100 metres below the ice. A US$21.6 million (20 million euros) upgrade, including a new waterproof access tunnel, was completed in 2019. It is “a safe and secure facility now,” said Hannes Dempewolf, head of global initiatives at Crop Trust.
In February 2020 the seed vault received 36 new seed varieties from around the world, including seeds from the Cherokee Nation pictured below). It was the biggest seed deposit since the opening of the facility in 2008.
“It’s a great honour,” said Chuck Hoskin Jr., principal chief of the Cherokee Nation, of making the Svalbard seed deposit. “It says something about the strength and endurance of the Cherokee Nation. We’re talking about plants that predate European contact. We’re talking about plants that helped sustain us as the United States and white settlers were encroaching on our lands.”
The Crop Trust hope that more institutions around the world will recognise the importance of this global back up and deposit seeds for safekeeping into the vault. “Continue to acknowledge the link between crop diversity conserved in gene banks and the food that’s on our tables and begin to invest in securing this foundation, forever.”

archdaily,https://www.archdaily.com/3506/svalbard-science-centre-jva ,"Text description provided by the architects. The project was commissioned through an invited competition. The new structure is an addition to an existing university and research building, which is extended to about 4 times its original size. The project also provides new facilities for the Svalbard Museum. The project is the very largest building in Longyearbyen and Spitzbergen.
The insulated copper-clad skin is wrapped around the program demanded, creating an outer shell adjusted to the flows of wind and snow passing through the site. Climatic 3D simulations has been undertaken to assure that the accumulation of snow would not create undesired conditions in front of doors and windows. In the process, the skin has been flexible to adjustments, both geometrical changes answering to the climatic studies and alterations of program. The building is elevated on poles to prevent the melting of the permanent frost - the only thing fixating the construction. The main structure is in timber, to facilitate on-site adjustments and avoid cold bridges. The outer copper cladding retains its workability even at low temperatures, thereby extending the construction period further into the cold season.
An important consideration has been to create vital public spaces and passages in the building, an ""interior campus"" area providing warm and lighted meeting places during the dark and cold winter. The pine-clad spaces have complex geometry relating to the outer skin of the building- the effectiveness of the circulation is maximized but at the same time it offers varied vistas and experiences. The technical infrastructure is hidden in the tilted walls of the interior. The use of color has been a necessity in a natural condition where colors are scarce.
Both physical and virtual models have been important tools in the design process, while an accurate 1:50 construction model has facilitated work on site.

nasa,https://www.earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/92325/losing-ice-in-svalbard ,"Mauri Pelto, an environmental scientist at Nichols College, has a go-to analogy for describing what a glacier needs to survive. “People need to consume the same number of calories as they expend to stay alive,” he said. Similarly, glaciers needs to accumulate at least as much snow and ice as they lose. “For glaciers, they need more than 50 percent of their area in the accumulation zone, which is the upper part of a glacier where snow persists year round.”
The mass a mountain glacier loses to evaporation, melting, or iceberg calving in the ablation zone cannot surpass the mass it adds near the top. Any imbalance causes glaciers to shrink over time, growing thinner, covering less area, and seeing their lowest edge (terminus) draw back toward the accumulation zone—a process scientists describe as retreat.
While other satellite sensors are needed to measure the thickness of glaciers, the natural- and infrared light imagers on the Landsat satellites excel at monitoring changes in glacial extent, snow lines and the positions of termini. Pelto has analyzed several decades of Landsat imagery for glaciers around the world and describes many of them on his blog From a Glacier’s Perspective.
One area Pelto has focused on is the Hornsund Fjord region in Svalbard, a remote Norwegian archipelago in the Arctic Ocean. The shallow fjord nearly divides the large island of Spitsbergen into two separate islands. Fourteen tidewater glaciers flow into the fjord, and all of them have retreated substantially during the past three decades. The Thematic Mapper (TM) on Landsat 5 captured a image (top) of Hornsund Fjord on August 20, 1990. The second image shows the same area on August 19, 2017, as observed by the Operational Land Imager (OLI) on Landsat 8.
Many of the glaciers have seen their termini retreat by several kilometers. One of the largest and fastest changing was Storbreen. “In Storbreen’s case, in 1990, 2013, and 2015, the snow line left only 20 percent of the glacier in the accumulation zone,“ explained Pelto. “This cannot sustain the other 80 percent. Storbreen will continue to lose mass until this equation balances or the glacier is lost.”
Since the water where Storbreen terminates is quite shallow, Pelto is confident that the glacier is retreating because rising air temperatures are driving the snow line higher up the glacier. In 1990, the snow line sat at an elevation of 400 meters. In 2013, 2014 and 2015, it has averaged about 500 meters. The center of Storbreen’s terminus has retreated nearly 6 kilometers (4 miles).

Why New Business Models Matter for Green Growth
New business models can make an important contribution to the transition to green growth. While some new business models involve large firms, others are small start-up firms that seek to exploit technological or commercial opportunities that have been neglected or not yet explored by more established firms. New firms tend to engage in more radical innovation than existing firms, and scaling up new business models can therefore help reduce environmental pollution, optimise the use of natural resources, increase productivity and energy efficiency, and provide a new source of economic growth. Although the market for green goods and services is growing, the development of new business models is affected by a range of barriers, many of which can be addressed by well-designed policies.
English . Innovation, Agricultural Productivity and Sustainability in Japan
In Japan, agriculture has been treated differently from other parts of the national economy. However, policy needs to evolve with new agricultural structures and the global trend towards more integrated value chains, enabling innovation and entrepreneurship in agriculture, and imposing a greater environmental responsibility on producers. Modern agriculture is a technology- and data-intensive industry, and Japan is well-positioned to introduce its competitive technology and skills to agriculture through building more collaborative agricultural innovation system.

Economic and environmental sustainability performance of environmental policies in agriculture
This report reviews the literature on the effects of agri-environmental policies on environmental sustainability and economic performance in agriculture. Examining these twin impacts is essential for understanding the scope for “win-win” policies which improve both types of performance, and where trade-offs between economic and environmental objectives may arise. The review considers findings on several underlying questions: i) whether agri-environmental policy instruments successfully deliver on their objectives to improve the environmental performance of agriculture, and ii) whether agri-environmental policy instruments slow down productivity growth or if they contribute to stimulating productivity growth and improved environmental outcomes. As part of this latter question, this review considers the impacts of agri-environmental policies on innovation, economic performance and structural change in agriculture. It brings together literature from across a range of disciplines, including evidence from over 160 papers. As a whole, the reviewed literature identifies significant “room for improvement” in both the effectiveness of agri-environmental policies for improving agricultural sustainability and their economic efficiency, particularly in relation to hybrid instruments (e.g. cross-compliance) and voluntary agri-environmental schemes (AES).

scidev,https://www.scidev.net/global/features/the-ethics-of-the-svalbard-global-seed-vault/ ,"When the Svalbard Global Seed Vault opened in Norway in February 2008, it was hailed as a ‘Noah’s Ark’ for protecting biodiversity for future generations. But critics are concerned about the possibility of large corporations exploiting small seed banks’ collections deposited at the vault.
Seed banks from around the world are encouraged to deposit their collections at Svalbard. But, according to Andrew Kimbrell, executive director of the Center for Food Safety, United States, by doing so the seed banks become subject to an international treaty on plant genetics that exposes their seeds to commercialisation by agribusiness companies.
Kimbrell likens the vault to a zoo because it does not protect the species in their natural habitats: ""It’s messianic but it doesn’t make any sense. You want to protect diversity in the habitat where it lives.
""What they’re doing for these corporations is putting them all in one place. This is one-stop shopping for the corporations,"" says Kimbrell.
Although the companies cannot patent the seeds, they can exploit and patent their genes, he says. Recent donations from some of the companies to the Global Crop Diversity Trust, which manages the vault, and a complex seed deposit agreement — which small seed banks may find confusing — are two reasons to worry, he adds.
Small seed banks ""don’t have a bank of lawyers"" to go through these contracts, he says.
Cary Fowler, executive director of the Global Crop Diversity Trust, dismisses such fears.
He says that donations from large agribusinesses represent only two per cent of the trust’s funding and come with ""no strings attached"".
The collection is already in the public domain anyway, so it does not make sense for companies to pay to access it, he adds.
Fowler also says that agreement to the international treaty is not a prerequisite for storing seeds at Svalbard — but collections covered by the treaty are given priority.

livescience,https://www.livescience.com/moon-trigger-methane-release-arctic.html ,"The moon could be affecting how much methane is released from the Arctic Ocean seafloor, a new study finds.
The tides, which are controlled by the moon, affect how much methane is released from seafloor sediments: Low tides mean less pressure and more methane released, while high tides create more pressure, and therefore less methane emission.
The research was conducted in the west-Svalbard region of the Arctic, with the findings published Oct. 9 in the journal Nature Communications.
""It is the first time that this observation has been made in the Arctic Ocean. It means that slight pressure changes can release significant amounts of methane. This is a game-changer and the highest impact of the study,"" study coauthor, Jochen Knies, a marine geologist at the Centre for Arctic Gas Hydrate, Environment and Climate (CAGE), said in a statement.
Related: 10 signs Earth's climate is off the rails
Methane is a greenhouse gas, which contributes to global warming by trapping and holding heat in the atmosphere. Huge methane reserves lurk beneath the seafloor and ocean warming is expected to unlock some of that trapped methane. So understanding how the tides impact these seafloor methane emissions is important for future climate predictions.
To find this tidal effect, the team measured the pressure and temperature inside the sediments and found that gas levels near the seafloor rise and fall with the tides.
By using a permanent monitoring tool they were able to identify methane release in an area of the Arctic Ocean where it has not previously been observed.
""This tells us that gas release from the seafloor is more widespread than we can see using traditional sonar surveys,” study co-author, Andreia Plaza Faverola, a marine geologist and geophysicist at CAGE, said in the statement.
Their discovery implies that scientists have been underestimating greenhouse gas emissions in the Arctic.
""What we found was unexpected and the implications are big. This is a deep-water site. Small changes in pressure can increase the gas emissions but the methane will still stay in the ocean due to the water depth. But what happens in shallower sites? This approach needs to be done in shallow Arctic waters as well, over a longer period. In shallow water, the possibility that methane will reach the atmosphere is greater,"" Knies said.
This newly discovered phenomenon also raises questions about how rising sea levels and ocean warming, both of which are caused by climate change, will interact. Because high tides reduce methane emissions, it's possible rising sea levels, which come with higher tides, might partially counterbalance the threat of increased gas emissions being caused by a warming ocean.

abc,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-08-13/github-code-vault-in-artic-svalbard-safeguards-against-calamity/12517948 ,"Buried deep in the ice is the GitHub code vault — humanity's safeguard against devastation
Svalbard is a remote, frozen archipelago midway between Norway and the North Pole.
Polar bears outnumber humans, yet it represents arguably the biggest insurance the world holds in case of global technological devastation.
And we just took out a fresh policy.
For the first time ever, open-source code that forms the basis of most of our computerised devices has been archived in a vault that should protect it for 1,000 years.
The code vault
If you're thinking that an Arctic code vault sounds like a high-tech library crossed with a Bond villain's lair, you're not far off.
Svalbard is remote, home to the world's northernmost town, and is protected by the century-old International Svalbard Treaty.
Crucially, it's already home to the successful Global Seed Vault, which saves seeds in case entire species ever get wiped out by disease or climate change.
Just down the road, the GitHub Archive Program found space in a decommissioned coal mine run by the Arctic World Archive, which already houses and preserves historical and cultural data from several countries.
All put together, the barren archipelago makes the perfect place to seal something you want to protect in a steel vault 250 metres under the permafrost.
The Arctic Code Archive aims to serve as a time capsule for the future, saving huge amounts of open-source computer code alongside a range of data including a record of Australia's biodiversity and examples of culturally significant works.
If you were to make your way into the mine and crack the large steel vault, you'd find 186 film reels inside, each a kilometre long, covered in tiny dots.
It's not just miniaturised text, though. To squeeze in as much as possible, the code is stored in tiny QR codes that pack the information in as densely as possible.
You run into open-source code every day without even knowing it. In fact, you're probably using some to read this article right now.
""Open-source"" means the code is shared freely between developers around the world and can be used for any application.
That means a little piece of coding could end up in anything from your TV to a Mars mission.
The concept fosters collaborative software engineering around the globe.
It's incredibly important, and it spans a range of complexity — from huge algorithms that mine Bitcoin to single lines of code that determine whether a number is odd or even.
Archiving all of that work means it won't have to be re-invented if it is ever lost, saving time and money.
The archive reels hold a combined 21 terabytes of code. That may not seem much if you have a hard drive at home that holds 2 terabytes.
But we're not storing your photos or movies here — each character in a line of code takes up a tiny bit of space.
If someone who types at about 60 words a minute sat down and tried to fill up all that space, it would take 111,300 years — and that's if they didn't get tired or need any breaks.
Built to last
If you're making an archive that's going to last, you've got to make sure it isn't going to degrade over time.
While it might seem intuitive to store the information on something like a Blu-ray disc or on hard drives, these are notorious for breaking down.
They're designed to be convenient, not to be heirlooms you pass down for generations.
""You might have seen this in the past ... years after you touched it last, you try to boot it up again and it wouldn't work,"" says GitHub's VP of strategic programs, Thomas Dohmke.
Things that survive the ravages of time tend to be physical. Think papyrus scrolls, Egyptian carvings or Assyrian tablets.
In fact, there's a good chance that people of a distant future will know more about ancient people than they will about us.
When it comes to making physical copies, your office A4 wouldn't cut it, so they used a refined version of century-old darkroom photography technology to create the archival film reels.
Each film is made of polyester coated in very stable silver halide crystals that allow the information to be packed in tightly.
The film has a 500-year life span, but tests that simulate aging suggest it will last twice as long.
Storing it in the Arctic permafrost on Svalbard gives you a host of added benefits.
The cold prevents any degradation caused by heat; it's locked deep in a mountain, protected from damaging UV rays and safe from rising sea levels; and it's remote enough that it's not likely to be lost to looters from a dystopian future.
Despite global warming, and a previous event at the seed bank where some of the permafrost melted, it's believed the archive is buried deep enough that the permafrost should survive.
Just in case, they're not stopping there.
The GitHub Archive Program is working with partners to figure out a way to store all public repositories for a whopping 10,000 years.
Called Project Silica, the goal is to write archives into the molecular structure of quartz glass platters with an incredibly precise laser that pulses a quadrillion times a second.
That's a 1 followed by 15 zeros: 1,000,000,000,000,000.
No clouds on the horizon
You might be wondering: doesn't the internet already save all of our information in the cloud?
Yes, but it's not as safe as you might think.
There are actually three levels of archiving, known as hot, warm and cold.
The hot layer is made up of online repositories like GitHub, which allows users to upload their code for anyone to use.
This is copied to servers around the world and is readily accessible to anyone with an internet connection.
While access is quick and easy, if someone removes their code from the hot layer, it is no longer available. That doesn't make for a very reliable archive.
The warm layer is run by the Internet Archive, which runs the Way Back Machine.
It crawls the web and regularly takes snapshots of sites and keeps them on their servers. Anyone can access them, but you have to do a bit of digging.
For example, you can still find the ABC webpage from January 3, 1997, which has the story of then Victorian Premier Jeff Kennett warning against Australia becoming a republic.
The Internet Archive isn't a perfect system — it takes regular snapshots, but anything that happened in-between can be lost.
Both the hot and warm layer work well together to give a fair idea of what the internet might have held at any given time, but they both suffer from one critical weakness: they are made up of electronics.
The internet is essentially millions of interconnected computers and huge data storage banks that your device can access.
If there was to be an event that disrupted or destroyed those computers, the information they hold — and therefore the internet — could be destroyed forever.
The Arctic vault represents the cold layer of archiving.
It's an incomplete snapshot taken at regular intervals (the plan is to add to the archive every five years), but one that should survive the majority of foreseeable calamities.
Some of the potential disasters are academic, but some we've seen before.
Going out with a bang
In early September 1859, the sun belched, and the world's very rudimentary electronics were fried.
It's known as the Carrington Event, and as the matter ejected from the sun headed towards Earth, the lights of the auroras were seen as far north as Queensland and all the way down to the Caribbean.
When it hit, the largest geomagnetic storm ever recorded caused sparks to fly off telegraph wires, setting fires to their poles. Some operators reported being able to send messages even though their power supplies were disconnected.
If that were to happen today, most of our electronics — both here and in space — would be destroyed.
And it's not really a matter of if, but when.
It also doesn't have to be a huge astronomical event that causes us to lose many generations' worth of information.
If a pandemic or economic downturn was severe enough, we might be unable to maintain or power the computers that make up the internet.
If you consider how technology has changed in just the last few decades — the rise of the internet, the increased use of mobile phones — then it's easy to understand how people living a hundred or a thousand years from now are likely to have technology that's wildly different from ours.
The archive is part of our generation's legacy.
As Mr Dohmke says:
Australian data has found a home in the archive, too, including the Atlas of Living Australia that details our country's plant and animal biodiversity, and machine learning models from Geoscience Australia that are used to understand bushfires and climate change.
A modern-day Rosetta Stone
There's no saying who might want to use the archive in the future, so archivists had to come up with a solution both for those who don't speak English and for those who might not understand our coding languages.
The films start with a guide to reading the archive, since there's a decent chance that anyone finding them in the future may not know how to interpret the QR codes.
Even more importantly, that's followed by a document called the Tech Tree, which details software development, programming languages and computer programming in general.
Crucially, it's all readable by eye.
Anyone wanting to read the archives might need to have at least a basic understanding of creating a magnifying lens (something humans achieved about 1,000 years ago) but after that the archive could all be translated using a pen and paper.
The guides aren't just in English, either. Like a modern-day Rosetta Stone, they are also written in Arabic, Spanish, Chinese, and Hindi, so that future historians have the best chance of deciphering the code.
""It takes time, obviously ... but it doesn't need any special machinery,"" Mr Dohmke says.
""Even if in 1,000 years something dramatic has happened that has thrown us back to the Stone Age, or if extraterrestrials or aliens are coming to the archive, we hope they will all understand what's on those film reels.""

In its business strategy for Svalbard, the Norwegian governments announces initiatives for a knowledge-based and sustainable business industry. At the same time, it wants to prevent less serious actors from establishing a presence on the archipelago. During the past seven years, there has been a 65 percent increase in the number of Norwegian-registered businesses on Svalbard, and the increase has been particularly large in tourism.
- We want to focus on quality and sustainability in the Longyearbyen community, not on growth as a goal in and of itself, says State Secretary Magnus Thue (Conservatives) in the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Fisheries in a press release.
This particular point has been a strong desire from the two largest political parties on Svalbard.
On Thursday 3 October, he presented the government’s strategy for innovation and business development in Longyearbyen. The strategy focuses amongst other on the following five areas:
Innovation and development
The government wants to open up for Innovation Norway and the Norwegian Research Council’s supporting new startups and development projects in Longyearbyen to a higher extent than before.
- We want to facilitate a wide range of high quality businesses. At the same time, we want to avoid growth that places further pressure on the limited infrastructure or preparedness activity, Thue says.
The government also wants to contribute to the work of the University Centre in Svalbard (UNIS) in increasing competence in business regarding sustainable and safe activity and traffic in the Arctic. UNIS recently established an Arctic Safety Center, which is to a.o. offer courses to the local community and businesses.
Longyearbyen local government plays an important role in work concerning business development and transition. The government wants to facilitate its continuing to do so.
Prevent less serious actors
Some businesses and industries in Svalbard face challenges related to illicit working conditions and other forms of work crime.
In tourism, there are several season-based actors that are not part of the organized labor market and that do not related to the industry’s own guidelines.
- This makes supervision hard. We also see that there are many foreign guides who do not always hold the local knowledge required. That causes challenges, Thue says.
In order to prevent less responsible businesses from operating, the government announces that it will consider whether several laws and regulations in force on the mainland should also be introduced for Svalbard.
Mapping tourism and challenges related to increased cruise tourism
The government wants to map the development of the tourist industry and to consider whether developments contribute to reaching the Svalbard policy targets. The government also wants to map the challenges to preparedness and safety that arise from increased shipping in and around Svalbard, primarily cruise ships, and to consider necessary measures; this in order to support a responsible and sustainable tourist industry.
- It is important that the development of tourism on Svalbard contributes to a positive community development in Longyearbyen and protects the vulnerable wildlife and nature, which is the core product of tourism there, says Thue.
The government also wants to increase its financial support to Visit Svalbard in order to make the organization better equipped to conduct activities that contribute to sustainable development of tourism there.
New purpose to Store Norske ownership
The local coalmining company Store Norske Spitsbergen Kullkompani (SNSK, or ‘Store Norske’) is a key actor on Svalbard. The government has decided on a new mission for the company as well as a new reasoning for the state’s ownership of the company.
The new framework for the company opens up for its current activities in logistics and tourism to potentially be further developed, as long as this supports the overall targets of Norwegian Svalbard policy. The current limiting regulation that says activities beyond mining are not to be expanded will be discontinued. Potential changes to the company’s strategy, including potential new activity, is to be discussed with the company’s owner at an early stage.
One of the Svalbard policy goals is the maintaining of Norwegian communities on the archipelago. The SNSK’s activities are to contribute to supporting the overall goals of the Norwegian Svalbard policy.
Exploiting Svalbard’s potential as a test arena
Due to its unique location, with isolated communities, extreme weather conditions and a changing climate, Longyearbyen holds a series of advantages as a test arena. A lot of research and testing is already taking place on Svalbard, both in academia as well as by commercial actors. The government wants to facilitate Norwegian business actors’ exploiting the potential provided by Svalbard for testing of new, sustainable solutions, whether these actors are in Longyearbyen or on the mainland.
The government further announces that it will consider improving facilitating of ship equipment testing in Arctic areas, and facilitating exercises on Svalbard for operating ships and for SAR operations in Arctic waters, with various public offices and private actors involved. The possibility for connecting such facilitation to the activities of the Arctic Safety Center at the University Centre in Svalbard will be included in its assessment.
This article was originally published in Norwegian and has been translated by HNN's Elisabeth Bergquist. . “This is not just about business in Svalbard; this is also about Norwegian sovereignty.”
Hilde and Stig Henningsen are local entrepreneurs in Svalbard who recently published an open letter on High North News to Svalbard Minister, Justice and Preparedness Minister Monika Mæland as well as Trade, Industry and Fisheries Minister Iselin Nybø and Foreign Minister Ine Eriksen Søreide.
Hilde and Stig Henningsen say to High North News that they worry about local businesses in Svalbard.
“We live on an archipelago that in many ways is isolated from the rest of the world. In one way it feels safe, at least when Svalbard does not have any registered cases of Corona infection. However, it also appears dramatic as a decision has been made that has enormous consequences for business here”, they say to High North News, and they continue:
“We do of course comply with infection control regulations and procedures, and we are loyal to national regulations. We take part in this huge joint effort on par with everyone else. As a citizen one has to accept the measures introduced by the authorities. However, we also argue that the government has to take the consequences of its decisions.”
In the autumn and winter, there are hardly travelers on Svalbard. Operators in active tourism make most of their money between the months from March through August.
“Even though our specific company or industry have not been told to shut down, like e.g. hairdressers and bars have had to, we are nevertheless in reality shut down. Very few people will want to spend 14 days quarantined immediately upon arriving to Svalbard.""
The crisis packages from the state to Norwegian businesses does not hit the mark for Svalbard’s travel industry. Season-based activities are not entitled to financial support. There are also very vague signals from the government about whether port and berthing taxes are covered by the crisis packages.
“The authorities say they will assist companies with support measures and packages, and they Svalbard is to be included. And we believe this. However, it turns out that the proposed solutions do not quite solve the problems we have in Svalbard.""
“Many companies here do not have the financial muscles to survive if this goes on. The very foundation for operations through the rest of the year will be gone for many”, says Stig Henningsen, and adds:
“Our company has not yet received clarification as to what packages we are entitled to. Yet we have running costs and no bookings anymore.”
Many companies here do not have the financial muscle to survive if this goes on. The very foundation for operations through the rest of the year will be gone for many
“One has to consider Svalbard with a Svalbard filter, not with Oslo filter. We feel that the authorities in Oslo do not quite grasp what reality here is really like.”
“What happens if we and other local businesses here do not survive financially? This is not just about business in Svalbard, it is also about Norwegian sovereignty. Having an active, vibrant society in Svalbard is vital for maintaining Norwegian sovereignty.”
“Being a business owner in Longyearbyen is about more than making money; business here is part of the Norwegian social contract about maintaining a Norwegian community in Svalbard”, they argue in their letter.

The Norwegian government launched its Svalbard business strategy in October 2019. The strategy announces an initiative for knowledge-based and sustainable business on the archipelago. The strategy also states that Norway shall maintain sovereignty firmly and constantly, and that Norway is to maintain Norwegian communities in Svalbard.
Terje Aunevik, Chair of Svalbard Business Forum, says to High North News that the tourist industry in Svalbard has come to an abrupt halt due to the current pandemic.
Svalbard Business Forum represents more than 60 local businesses in Svalbard and works on an overall level to facilitate business on the archipelago.
“Bit by bit, this is also hitting the rest of business here. They lag behind, but we are beginning to see the consequences now. When May has passed, I believe many companies will be struggling with red figures”, says Aunevik to High North News.
Mining used to be the dominant industry in Svalbard. Today, tourism is one of the key industries on the archipelago.
“Local business in Svalbard mainly consists of relatively small companies. There are not any capital-strong communities here. Many operate with red figures through most of the year, but most of them manage to reach an overall balance where they cover their losses during peak season, which is from March through August.”
The mining industry employed some 400 people in 2009. In 2020, this figure is down to approximately 100.
Tourism employed some 280 persons in 2009. By 2018, this figure had increased to approximately 600.
“Predictability is amongst the most important things for tourism, and that is of course hard to achieve during a pandemic. However, we believe it is crucial to at least set a date for when we can resume business as usual again. And that is urgent for many companies.”
Local business in Svalbard mainly consists of relatively small companies. There are not any capital-strong communities here
“Tourism suprassed mining when it comes to turnover in Svalbard as far back as in 2015. Tourism and culture has an annual turnover of NOK 1 billion. This is a turnover that most likely will be lost for 2020.”
“Many of the support schemes presented by the government do not cover the losses suffered by businesses here. And an increasing number of companies in Svalbard fall outside the scope of these crisis packages.”
Aunevik believes it to be essential that locally owned business and locally based tourism on Svalbard be maintained first.
“I am deeply worried that this crisis is hitting the local actors the hardest. They are vital for Norway and for Norwegian Svalbard policy. They contribute to population and activity. Today, there are no advantages in being locally based. However, being that incurs year-round costs. I believe the most important feature will be support schemes that contribute to businesses being able to operate locally and throughout the year in Svalbard.”
“That said, I am glad that we live in a country where there are support schemes for businesses at all. The government has also adjusted some of their initiatives for us up here already, and credit is due to them for their being attentive. We understand that it is hard to find schemes that fit all.”
“We fully understand that this is a global crisis. People and health should come first. And we understand that this is hard to balance against the economy.”

In its business strategy for Svalbard, the Norwegian governments announces initiatives for a knowledge-based and sustainable business industry. At the same time, it wants to prevent less serious actors from establishing a presence on the archipelago. During the past seven years, there has been a 65 percent increase in the number of Norwegian-registered businesses on Svalbard, and the increase has been particularly large in tourism.
- We want to focus on quality and sustainability in the Longyearbyen community, not on growth as a goal in and of itself, says State Secretary Magnus Thue (Conservatives) in the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Fisheries in a press release.
This particular point has been a strong desire from the two largest political parties on Svalbard.
On Thursday 3 October, he presented the government’s strategy for innovation and business development in Longyearbyen. The strategy focuses amongst other on the following five areas:
Innovation and development
The government wants to open up for Innovation Norway and the Norwegian Research Council’s supporting new startups and development projects in Longyearbyen to a higher extent than before.
- We want to facilitate a wide range of high quality businesses. At the same time, we want to avoid growth that places further pressure on the limited infrastructure or preparedness activity, Thue says.
The government also wants to contribute to the work of the University Centre in Svalbard (UNIS) in increasing competence in business regarding sustainable and safe activity and traffic in the Arctic. UNIS recently established an Arctic Safety Center, which is to a.o. offer courses to the local community and businesses.
Longyearbyen local government plays an important role in work concerning business development and transition. The government wants to facilitate its continuing to do so.
Prevent less serious actors
Some businesses and industries in Svalbard face challenges related to illicit working conditions and other forms of work crime.
In tourism, there are several season-based actors that are not part of the organized labor market and that do not related to the industry’s own guidelines.
- This makes supervision hard. We also see that there are many foreign guides who do not always hold the local knowledge required. That causes challenges, Thue says.
In order to prevent less responsible businesses from operating, the government announces that it will consider whether several laws and regulations in force on the mainland should also be introduced for Svalbard.
Mapping tourism and challenges related to increased cruise tourism
The government wants to map the development of the tourist industry and to consider whether developments contribute to reaching the Svalbard policy targets. The government also wants to map the challenges to preparedness and safety that arise from increased shipping in and around Svalbard, primarily cruise ships, and to consider necessary measures; this in order to support a responsible and sustainable tourist industry.
- It is important that the development of tourism on Svalbard contributes to a positive community development in Longyearbyen and protects the vulnerable wildlife and nature, which is the core product of tourism there, says Thue.
The government also wants to increase its financial support to Visit Svalbard in order to make the organization better equipped to conduct activities that contribute to sustainable development of tourism there.
New purpose to Store Norske ownership
The local coalmining company Store Norske Spitsbergen Kullkompani (SNSK, or ‘Store Norske’) is a key actor on Svalbard. The government has decided on a new mission for the company as well as a new reasoning for the state’s ownership of the company.
The new framework for the company opens up for its current activities in logistics and tourism to potentially be further developed, as long as this supports the overall targets of Norwegian Svalbard policy. The current limiting regulation that says activities beyond mining are not to be expanded will be discontinued. Potential changes to the company’s strategy, including potential new activity, is to be discussed with the company’s owner at an early stage.
One of the Svalbard policy goals is the maintaining of Norwegian communities on the archipelago. The SNSK’s activities are to contribute to supporting the overall goals of the Norwegian Svalbard policy.
Exploiting Svalbard’s potential as a test arena
Due to its unique location, with isolated communities, extreme weather conditions and a changing climate, Longyearbyen holds a series of advantages as a test arena. A lot of research and testing is already taking place on Svalbard, both in academia as well as by commercial actors. The government wants to facilitate Norwegian business actors’ exploiting the potential provided by Svalbard for testing of new, sustainable solutions, whether these actors are in Longyearbyen or on the mainland.
The government further announces that it will consider improving facilitating of ship equipment testing in Arctic areas, and facilitating exercises on Svalbard for operating ships and for SAR operations in Arctic waters, with various public offices and private actors involved. The possibility for connecting such facilitation to the activities of the Arctic Safety Center at the University Centre in Svalbard will be included in its assessment.

internetgeography,https://www.internetgeography.net/topics/svalbard-case-study/ ,"Svalbard Case Study
Svalbard is an archipelago (a large group of islands) located in northern Europe, halfway between Norway and the North Pole. It is one of the world’s northernmost inhabited areas and is administered by Norway. It has a permanent population of 2700, of which 2300 live in Longyearbyen, the administrative centre of the islands.
Svalbard is known for its remote terrain of glaciers and tundra sheltering polar bears, Svalbard reindeer and Arctic foxes. The Northern Lights are visible during winter, and summer brings the “midnight sun”, sunlight for 24 hours a day.
How has migration brought people to Svalbard?
The first residents of Svalbard were whalers, who arrived 400 years ago. The whalers were followed by miners, who extracted large quantities of coal for exportation around the world. Today, high-end tourist workers catering for last-chance to see cruises through the disappearing Arctic ice, are the latest residents, along with academics and diplomats studying the impact of climate change. Under the terms of the Svalbard Treaty recognising Norway’s sovereignty, anyone can live in the archipelago without a visa, laeding to a demographic shift with English, Thais, Germans and Italians now living in Svalbard.
Opportunities for development in Svalbard
Svalbard has a range of development opportunities.
Mineral Extraction in Svalbard
Svalbard has a significant amount of coal and coal mining is the main economic activity on the islands, once employing over 300 people.
Energy in Svalbard
A coal-fired power station in Svalbard meets the energy requirements of the island. Along with the need to fly frequently, it is one of the reasons why the carbon footprint of Svalbard residents is among the largest in Europe.
The island has the potential to meet its energy needs through solar energy during the summer when there are 24 hours of sunlight. To overcome this Svalbard town council has reached an agreement with the Norwegian government to build a hydrogen power plant, which will generate clean electricity, producing only water as a byproduct. However, the coal mining community have to be won over before it is constructed. Though this should be achievable given only 45 people now work at the coal mine, which is currently at 10% of its former capacity.
Fishing in Svalbard
The Barents Sea that surrounds Svalbard is home to some of the best fishing grounds in the world, with over 150 species of fish, including haddock and herring. Fishing in this area is controlled, which means it is sustainable as overfishing is illegal.
Tourism in Svalbard
Svalbard is a popular tourist destination and is visited regularly by cruise ships. Some 70,000 tourists visited in 2011, of which 30,000 arrived on cruise ships. The harbour has been enlarged to accommodate large cruise ships. As the sea ice no longer freezes around Svalbard cruise ships can now stop in the winter which has extended the tourist season.
People are attracted to Svalbard because of its natural beauty and wildlife. Adventure tourism is a growth industry in Svalbard with people participating in leisure activities such as hiking, kayaking and riding snowmobiles.
Development challenges in Svalbard
Extreme Temperature
Winter temperatures can drop below -30°C in Svalbard. This, along with limited sunlight in the winter, makes working outside very challenging. In the winter the sea freezes and roads become very dangerous.
Buildings and Infrastructure
Permafrost in Svalbard creates considerable challenges for building and constructing infrastructure. Roads are built on raised gravel beds to reduce heat transfer which can thaw the permafrost.
Many domestic services such as freshwater and sanitation have to be provided above ground in insulated utilidors to minimise the risk of freezing pipes and thawing the permafrost. Runways are painted white to reflect the energy and reduce the transfer of heat from the sun.
Inaccessibility
Svalbard is a very remote region, relying on transport such as planes and ships for access. Some roads depend on crossing frozen rivers in the winter, which is very dangerous. Locals rely on snowmobiles and 4x4s in the winter.

Quark Expeditions is profoundly committed to environmentally responsible tourism. Protecting the places we visit is necessary to ensure we can continue to introduce travelers to the spectacular beauty of the polar wilderness. Through Polar Promise, our comprehensive sustainability strategy framework, we’ve incorporated existing sustainability initiatives into a cohesive plan so we can identify where we can do better or do more.
“Quark Expeditions recognizes its responsibility to do more to protect these magnificent places,” says Andrew White, President of Quark Expeditions. “We want to go beyond reducing our footprint. We want to work with other leaders in the industry and with our guests to address the complex and challenging issues facing the polar regions.”
Our Polar Promise framework is made up of four pillars. Each addresses a different aspect of our business, our operations—and ultimately your journey.
Principles
Embedding Responsible Business Practices
Quark Expeditions aims to be the leader in responsible polar tourism, the ‘go-to’ operator for conscious travelers and the preferred partner of the world’s most responsible brands. As a polar-focused tourism operator, our sustainability principles are integral to every decision we make, whether it’s in the polar wilderness or in the places we work every day. We employ the best people in the industry and will lead the industry in the diversification of our workforce. We work to reduce our impact, catalyze change in the industry and help improve our suppliers’ operations.
We’re proud, long-time members in key industry organizations, such as the Association of Arctic Expedition Cruise Operators (AECO) and the International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators (IAATO). We adhere to these organizations’ stringent guidelines, which are designed to ensure the Polar Regions are protected for future generations.
Planet
Reducing Our Footprint and Building Resilience
When it comes to our footprint, the most substantial impact we can have is how we get you, our guest, to the remote Polar environments and how we preserve those majestic environments once we get there.
Quark Expeditions aims to reduce our carbon emissions per passenger by 10% through fleet improvements and changes in order to reduce our impact. We’re working with our supply chain to measure, report and reduce their emissions, and our office and field operations aim to reuse or recycle 100% of waste on Quark Expeditions-owned vessels.
In 2019, an analysis of our historical ship fuel consumption showed that we decreased emissions by 13% from the 5-year average emissions per passenger per day. The purpose of this analysis was to establish a baseline and to further reduce our Scope 1 carbon emissions.
In terms of waste, Quark Expeditions has taken steps to reduce the amount of waste we are sending to landfills, including avoiding single-use plastics and partnering in the SeaGreen recycling initiative in Ushuaia. We’re working towards a zero-waste plan on Quark Expeditions-owned vessels.
Partnerships
Conservation and Impact in Polar Environments
Quark Expeditions aims to be the leading expedition investor in outreach projects within the polar regions, working with a wide circumpolar network of scientists, community leaders, and sustainable innovators. Our goal is to contribute a minimum of $500,000 USD each year through in-kind donations, Quark Expeditions funding, and funds from passenger auctions in support of key polar environmental research, community engagement and sustainable development projects.
Nalunaiqsijiit, the Inuit Cruise Training Initiative, is a program dedicated to providing Nunavummiut with the qualifications and certifications required to work onboard expedition cruise ships, through in situ training and experience onboard ships. Quark Expeditions is excited to have hosted two Nalunaiqsijiit interns onboard Ocean Adventurer during the 2019 Arctic season, and have invited an additional four during the 2019/20 Antarctic Season.
Thanks to our guests’ support, proceeds from Quark Expeditions’ onboard auctions have contributed an average of $200,000 each year to organizations dedicated to polar environmental research, community engagement, and sustainable development projects.
Some of the organizations we’re supporting this year include the South Georgia Heritage Trust, Penguin Watch, Seabird Watch, and Polar Bears International.
Positive Impact
Building our guests’ Polar Legacy
Quark Expeditions aspires to facilitate a meaningful connection between people and places, between wilderness and humankind, and we firmly believe in the long-lasting exponential impact that travelers can have. We aim to inspire and empower our guests and partners to make positive change, the collective impact of which can be greater than our operational impact. We are facilitating and capturing the positive impact of our guests as part of the Polar Ambassador Program.

How We Did in 2019
The goals for Quark Expeditions’ Polar Promise for 2019 have been largely to establish baselines and processes for collecting data for the future. While this may not be glamorous, it has proven to be powerful and has armed all of us with information about the small and not-so-small impact of the changes Quark Expedition made over the past few years. This step is an important one to ensure that sustainable programming remains part of who we are and what we do.
We achieved some significant progress towards our goals in 2019, some of which are highlighted in the infographic below.
In our first sustainability report, we’ve summarize our progress in launching our Polar Promise sustainability strategy and reflect on successes and challenges in 2019.
Operating in the last two great wildernesses on the planet is a great privilege to all of us at Quark Expeditions. But that honor of exploring the Arctic and Antarctica comes with a great responsibility that’s felt—and wholeheartedly embraced—by each and every one of us on the Quark Expeditions team. Whether we’re leading guests on a kayak excursion in the waters of Antarctica or in our head office helping guests plan their next polar journey, protecting the polar regions is always first and foremost.
Just as we go beyond in the polar seas to create life-changing experiences for our guests, we’re equally determined to do whatever we can to preserve the pristine polar environments for the next generation. That’s why we call this our Polar Promise.

Spitsbergen is the largest island in the Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard, which also includes the three smaller islands of Nordaustlandet, Barentsøya and Edgeøya. It’s often called “The land of the midnight sun.” It’s also known as “The Wildlife Capital of the Arctic.” Spitsbergen, about 1,300 kilometers from the North Pole, is dark four months of the year, but when the sun returns in April, the days lengthen until sometime in June when the sun never sets—all the better for viewing the wildlife that has made Spitsbergen so popular with travelers on a quest to observe polar bears and other wildlife, such as walruses, reindeers, arctic foxes, beluga whales, seals and seabirds.
Up until the 1920s, the Svalbard archipelago (the combined population is 2,884) was essentially a no man’s land until Norwegian sovereignty was officially granted by the Spitsbergen Treaty. Longyearbyen, the administrative center of the archipelago situated on Spitsbergen, began as a coal mining town. Today the focus is on wildlife, glaciers and fjords. .

The Fridtjof Nansen Institute (FNI) has received funding for three large, multi-partner research projects: one on Norway's 'green transition', one on EU energy market regulations, and one focusing on new economic possibilities on Svalbard.
The grants were announced on 13 December, when the Research Council of Norway (RCN) presented its annual research funding decisions in the categories ‘Competence-building projects for the private sector’ (‘Kompetansebyggende prosjekter for næringslivet’) and ‘Collaborative projects for societal challenges and business development’ (‘Samarbeidsprosjekter or samfunnsutfordringer og næringsutvikling’). These are projects that require collaboration with partners outside academia, and which are designed to build knowledge, expertise and practical approaches to dealing with societal challenges.
In order to solve the challenges of our time, we must work together. With these projects we’re bringing the best minds from the research community together with those closest to the actual challenges’, said the Minister for Research and Higher Education in Norway, Iselin Nybø in a statement.
FNI has been granted funding for three different projects – two of which will be coordinated and led by FNI, and one where we are a contributing research partner.
EU energy market regulations
One of the projects which passed the RCN bar concerns EU energy policies. This project, titled ‘Implementing Network Codes’ (INC), will focus on the nitty-gritty of EU electricity market regulations, and how these are implemented at member-state level. Specifically, the project will analyse whether the process of implementation enables customized solutions at the national and regional level, or leads to greater EU integration.
The project will involve 17 public and private partners, including the University of Oslo (UiO), Thema Consulting Group, the Norwegian Ministry of Petroleum and Energy, DNV GL, Energy Norway, Statkraft and a long list of other power- and grid-related companies. The project also has strong international research partnerships, including the Florence School of Regulation, the University of Göttingen, Utrecht University and the University of Exeter.
INC will investigate how EU energy market legislation is implemented. Policies must not only be adopted, but also implemented. It is here that political conflicts and negotiations on specific rules for the electricity system are thrashed out’, explains FNI Research Fellow and project leader Torbjørg Jevnaker.
Svalbard’s blue potential
The second project, titled ‘The Blue Potential on Svalbard: A Hub for Arctic fisheries?’ (SVALFISH), will focus on the ongoing transition on the Svalbard Archipelago, specifically Longyearbyen, now undergoing the transformation from a mining community towards a multi-functional 21st-century Arctic hub.
The project will investigate the potentials and conditions for increased fishery and related activities based on Svalbard, and what this might entail, both for Longyearbyen and for polar fisheries more generally.
The project will examine the new opportunities emerging on and around Svalbard, at a time when everyone is talking about the “blue economy”’, says Andreas Østhagen, FNI Senior Research Fellow, who was instrumental in preparing the application. ‘We have involved the most relevant actors in the field and intend to examine the resource and business potential of increased fisheries around Svalbard, and the societal and political effects of such activity.’
Young research talents
Also the Svalbard project has attracted a substantial list of partners, from both the private and the public sector. These include the Norwegian Fishermen's Sales Organisation, Cape Fish, Polar Seafood, Pole Position, Svalbard Marine Utvikling and the Svalbard Business Council. On the research side, the Centre for the Ocean and the Arctic, the High North Center for Business and Governance at Nord University Business School, Nofima, the Center for the Blue Economy in Monterey, California, and The Arctic Institute will be collaborating partners in the project.
Moreover, FNI has been granted NRC funding for a third research project, ‘Enabling the green transition in Norway’ (ENABLE). This multi-partner project, focusing on climate and energy policies in Norway, will be headed by CICERO Center for International Climate Research, with FNI as one of the research partners. For FNI, the main focus will be on the development of EU climate and energy policies and implementation in Norway.
New FNI Director Iver B. Neumann is pleased to note that the institute continues to attract new partnerships and funding for research in what is becoming an increasingly competitive sector. He particularly highlights the fact that younger scholars will be taking the lead in the projects coordinated by FNI.
These are young, talented scholars. It’s simply wonderful to see them advancing at such an astonishing pace,’ concludes Neumann. . ",False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False

The man’s mouth is set resolutely in a straight line, and his forehead, framed by the fur of his arctic parka, is deeply furrowed by weather and age. Is that steely determination on his face, or weary resignation? It’s hard to say. But his eyes appear calm as he stares out towards the horizon, and the slate-grey sea that killed him.
“His eyes appear calm as he stares out towards the horizon, and the slate-grey sea that killed him.”
Finding a statue of Roald Amundsen, the greatest of all polar explorers, makes perfect sense in this setting. We’re in Ny-Ålesund on the Svalbard archipelago, the northernmost civilian settlement on the planet. It was from here, in 1926, that the Norwegian navigator launched his last great achievement – a successful bid to reach the North Pole by air. In fact, the tower to which his enormous airship, the Norge, was tethered is still visible, just a few hundred metres from where his statue now stands. Svalbard was also Amundsen’s destination two years later, when the flying boat he was travelling in disappeared over the ocean.
A display in the tiny Ny-Ålesund museum, open by appointment to the trickle of visitors who make it here, tells how Amundsen fell out with the pilot of the Norge, Umberto Nobile, after their success.

The Svalbard Global Seed Vault, tucked away in the Arctic Circle between Norway and the North Pole, has received a new intake of 50,000 seeds from all over the world.
The building houses an immense number of plant seeds to ensure Earth’s ongoing food security, and as such holds the key to human survival in a potentially post-apocalyptic world.
The incredible building is buried 130 metres inside a mountain and is designed to protect crop seeds such as beans, rice and wheat against nuclear war or disease.
For obvious reasons, the underground concrete structure is popularly known as the Doomsday Vault.
The new batch of 50,000 seeds is one of the largest single deposits made to the vault since scientists built the structure in 2008.
Despite being funded by Norway, the vault is managed by international organisation Crop Trust and has designated places for every nation on the planet to provide seedlings of native species.
The countries that contributed to the latest addition include Benin, India, Pakistan, Lebanon, Morocco, the Netherlands, the US, Mexico, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Belarus, and the UK.
“Today’s seed deposit at Svalbard supported by The Crop Trust shows that despite political and economic differences in other arenas, collective efforts to conserve crop diversity and produce a global food supply for tomorrow continue to be strong,” said Marie Haga, executive director of the Crop Trust.
“Nearly every country has agreed on the importance on conserving crop diversity through Target 2.5 of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals to conserve agricultural diversity in seed collections,” she added.

The vault currently holds nearly a million different varieties of seeds originating from almost every country in the world — including North Korea.
Seed samples for some of the world’s most vital food sources like the potato, sorghum, rice, barley, chickpea, lentil and wheat will be deposited at Svalbard in the coming days, bringing the total number of seed samples at the facility to 930,821.
Despite this large collection, the vault is far from capacity.
“The Seed Vault has the capacity to store 4.5 million varieties of crops. Each variety will contain on average 500 seeds, so a maximum of 2.5 billion seeds may be stored,” the Crop Trust website says.
In order to prevent contamination, seed samples are shipped to the island in large boxes, where they are scanned with X-rays to ensure the contents are safe.
To protect its assets, the vault comes equipped with five doors with coded locks, which are only accessible by only a few people in the world.
To further ensure security, the vault is only unlocked for deposits three or four times a year.
For optimal storage, the seeds are sealed in custom made three-ply foil packages and are kept in temperatures of minus 18C.
Thankfully, the location of the vault works a failsafe for these conditions.
“Permafrost and thick rock ensure that the seed samples will remain frozen even without power,” the website reads. . ",False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False

Snøhetta has designed a visitor centre for two archives, which will be built within the Arctic Circle on the Norwegian island of Spitsbergen in the Svalbard archipelago.
Named The Arc, the building will be a place for people to digitally view items from the Svalbard Global Seed Vault, which is the world's largest, secure seed-storage, and the Arctic World Archive – a digital vault of the world's history and culture.
""Today, there is really no option for people to visit the seed vault,"" said Julie Aars, senior architect at Snøhetta.
""Several tourists try to visit it but get disappointed when they realise that they can only see it from the outside, as most of the vault is located underground with strict security measures,"" she told Dezeen.
""The visitor centre will let people experience what is stored inside the vault without going into the vault itself.""
The visitor centre will be split into two clearly defined volumes.
The entrance building, which will contain the ticket office, a cafe and offices for staff, will be a rectangular structure made from cross-laminated timber (CLT) that will be raised above the ground on stilts. This building will be clad with burnt wood and dark glass panels and topped with solar panels.
Alongside the entrance block, and connected to it by an enclosed, glass-sided bridge, the exhibition building will be a large conical form.
""While the entrance building is rational and stoic, and something you might recognise from other buildings, the exhibition building is extravagant from the outside, yet introverted and mysterious on the inside,"" explained Aars.
""The exhibition building is formed to resemble something outside of time and space. The form can be interpreted as being timeless and scale-less – and is both familiar and otherworldly at the same time.""
Inside the cone, Snøhetta has designed an exhibition space that resembles the form of the actual archive spaces, which are located underground within the permafrost – permanently frozen ground.
""The contrasting volumes are designed to give visitors the experience of going from a familiar entrance into a real vault inside the permafrost of Svalbard,"" said Aars.
""Upon entering the exhibition room, the audience will experience an enigmatic space that will allow them to contemplate and reflect while they take in the exhibition materials.""
Visitors will be able to view some selective physical items from the archives alongside projections and VR experiences of digital items.
At the centre of the space is the ceremony room – an enclosed space for lectures and talks.
Snøhetta, and Arctic Memory AS that commissioned the building, hope that the visitor centre will help people learn about the world's physical and digital resources.
""The aim is to make available to the public archives and knowledge that is stored deep into the permafrost of Svalbard – to make it valuable not only to future generations but also to current ones,"" explained Aars.
""Moreover, we hope that the visitor centre will inspire people and have them contemplate the value of the world's resources and history, and how these need to be preserved, respected and managed for future generations to partake in the great progress of our civilisation as well.""

How a cluster of islands near the North Pole offers tips for world peace
Svalbard, the land of polar bears and the midnight sun, is a visa-free zone – under a treaty signed 100 years ago this month. How might it help in resolving territorial disputes today?
There’s a ""very real danger"" of running into polar bears in Svalbard, warns the official website for the Arctic tourist destination.
Of course, the opportunity to spot a bear – from a safe distance – is one of the main reasons why travellers fly or sail to the archipelago halfway between Norway and the North Pole.
But adventurers not accompanied by guides are urged to pack flare guns, thunder flashes and a .308 Win calibre rifle with their hot drinks and GPS devices – strictly for self-defence in the event that a bear encounter turns ugly.
That guns are one of life’s necessities on Svalbard is just one idiosyncratic feature of one of the world’s northernmost human settlements. (The guns are not allowed inside buildings and must be visibly unloaded in town; this is Norway, not the Wild West.)
Other tourist drawcards to Svalbard include the midnight sun and polar nights – there is no daylight from November to February. There is the Global Seed Vault, where millions of plant seeds, including from Australia, are kept chilled in a bunker carved into a mountain. And Svalbard boasts the world’s northernmost statue of Vladimir Lenin, in the ghost town of Pyramiden.
And for visitors who want Arctic nosh, Svalbard's main settlement, Longyearbyen, offers a Michelin-star restaurant where diners graze on roe and elderflower and reindeer carpaccio while quaffing wines from a 20,000-bottle cellar.
Other facts about Svalbard are more prosaic. If you need to give birth, you must fly elsewhere. If you die, your body must be flown out. (The cemeteries were closed for burials decades ago because nothing decomposed in the frozen ground.)
Even the way Svalbard has been run, since Count Wedel Jarlsberg of Norway and others signed a treaty on February 9, 1920, is unusual. Australia is actually a party to the Spitsbergen (or Svalbard) Treaty, which covers some 62,000 square kilometres of glacial islands and fjords dotted with walruses and snow geese. Far from being a relic of a post-World War I era, the treaty is still the subject of debate while also providing inspiration for resolving gnarly international tensions in 2020.
How is this so? How do things run in Svalbard? And what could its treaty possibly have to do with Australia, the South China Sea and outer space?
How did Australia get to be involved in an Arctic treaty?
Before the treaty, the islands of Svalbard (known as Spitsbergen until 1925) were in legal limbo. No one nation was running the show. Life had centred on activities such as whaling, seal hunting and Arctic exploration, including an ill-fated attempt by Swedish engineer Salomon August Andree to fly a hydrogen balloon to the North Pole in 1897. By 1920, it was coal mining that was shaping settlement on Svalbard.
The Paris Peace Conference in Versailles was a timely opportunity to find a solution to what then US Secretary of State, Robert Lansing, called ""a unique international problem"".
With revolutionary Russia absent from the table, it was agreed that sovereignty of the ""lawless"" islands would go to neutral Norway and they would never be used for ""warlike purposes"" – and any party to the treaty could do business in Svalbard. Russia has since acceded to the treaty, which has 46 members.
Australia was on board right from the start simply because it was part of the dominion of Great Britain, its involvement a ""historical quirk"", says Professor Don Rothwell of the ANU’s College of Law, who points out that Antarctica is, rightly, the focus for Australia in polar affairs. ""I don't think it really reflects any Australian interests in Spitsbergen at the time,"" he says ""and, certainly to my knowledge, since then Australia has not really expressed great interest in Svalbard.""
Why should we be interested in how Svalbard is run then?
""Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the Svalbard Treaty is that it creates the world’s most open migration zone, apart from possibly Antarctica,"" says Andrew Simon-Butler from the Melbourne Social Equity Institute at the University of Melbourne. ""This completely visa-free regime, which Norway voluntarily extends beyond treaty parties to all people, is coupled with a thriving international community, particularly in the capital of Longyearbyen.""
Svalbard has roughly 2600 residents. Two-thirds are Norwegian but the rest are from 49 other countries, including Australia and New Zealand, according to the office of Svalbard’s governor, the Sysselmann.
""People living in Svalbard tend to be highly motivated, educated, interested, curious and social,"" says Rupert Krapp, a research engineer with the Norwegian Polar Institute in Svalbard. ""There is no native or indigenous population so every single one of us has made a conscious choice to come and stay. Those who do not thrive here tend to figure this out fairly quickly after arrival and depart again. Those who really like it tend to stay for as long as they can, typically for a few years or even up to 10 or more years.""
Of course, there are caveats on the treaty’s ""non-discrimination"" approach. You must be able to show you can support yourself. Norway's Social Welfare Act does not apply. There is no financial assistance for special needs because of illness, disability or age. Criminality is a no-no. A Russian man who had just arrived in Longyearbyen was sentenced to 14 months in prison last year for committing Svalbard’s first bank robbery.
The extreme conditions are their own disincentive too. On February 9, the temperature is forecast to peak at minus 10 degrees in Longyearbyen. The sun won't come up. And there are dangers other than bears. In 2015, an avalanche descended on homes in Longyearbyen, killing a man and a little girl and forcing townsfolk to scrabble to unbury trapped families.
Russia, which has a longstanding interest in Svalbard – and a presence there that includes the coal-mining settlement at Barentsburg – tested the open-access regime in 2015 with the unannounced visit of then deputy prime minister Dmitry Rogozin at Longyearbyen Airport while he was subject to travel sanctions following Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea. Rogozin, pictured above, tweeted photos to mark his visit. ""In response, Norway added being subject to international travel sanctions as an additional ground for exclusion,"" says Simon-Butler.
In turn, the Russian Foreign Ministry protested at the ""unfriendly step"", saying it did ""not meet the spirit of the international cooperation on Svalbard on the basis of the 1920 Svalbard Treaty"".
What might Svalbard have to do with the South China Sea?
The connection between Svalbard and the South China Sea is not, at first, obvious. But, for Professor Rothwell and other international law experts, the Svalbard Treaty offers a useful precedent for sorting out territorial disputes.
""Svalbard has attracted more attention in the last 10 or 15 years because it’s been seen as a possible way of cutting through issues in the South China Sea,"" says Professor Rothwell. Islands and reefs (and fishing rights that flow from the ownership of these) in the South China Sea are the subject of intense – sometimes violent – dispute among China, Indonesia, Malaysia and Vietnam as well as the Philippines, Taiwan and Brunei.
""The way in which Svalbard has been managed is actually a good international example of how states were able to set aside conflicts and some differences to peacefully manage a set of very remote islands,"" says Professor Rothwell. It may have worked well ""because Svalbard is quite isolated and the treaty was negotiated post-WWI, when there was obviously a lot of momentum behind trying to ensure that territorial disputes became neutralised"" – but it still offers helpful concepts.
The arrangement on Svalbard is known as a ""condominium"" in international law. ""It's designed to reflect shared ownership of territory. Svalbard is the largest territory that has been subject to a condominium arrangement. There’s nothing equivalent.
""Could you apply a Svalbard condominium-type solution in the South China Sea?"" he asks. ""It could be that Island X is Chinese but other states have an interest; Island Y is Filipino but other states have an interest; Island Z is Vietnamese but other states have an interest. Or you could say, ‘Islands X, Y and Z are Chinese but other states also have legitimate interests in those islands’.""
Professor Rothwell concedes that this idea has never been actively advanced by any of the countries with interests in the South China Sea.
What might the treaty have to do with outer space?
The treaty offers a template for other remote and inhospitable communities too, says Andrew Simon-Butler. He has written extensively on the Svalbard Treaty’s potential application to outer space, a realm governed by laws from the 1960s and ’70s – modern by Svalbard Treaty standards but still being actively interpreted in legal circles to address issues in space today.
While outer space is considered ""the province of all mankind"", the jury is out on whether this means resources mined there are also the province of all nations. The United States passed a law in 2015 allowing its citizens property rights to resources mined from asteroids and authorising a US licensing program for mining in space.
As Simon-Butler sees it, a regime for outer space could recognise humankind’s overarching sovereignty but also provide the authority for individual space settlements and mining operations to be administered by a country in the way that Norway runs Svalbard. ""Similar caveats to completely unrestricted access as exist on Svalbard could also apply, particularly, say, if migrating to a space station where air supply and accommodation will be limited.""
He also contends there could be ""a Svalbard-style freedom of movement in outer space possessed by each person as a human right that would guarantee that the economic potential of space is open to all"".
Does this mean everyone is happy over Svalbard in 2020?
It's no secret that there is geopolitical jockeying underway in the Arctic, which may be ice-free by 2050. The melting ice means the opening of shipping routes, for both tourism and militaries, and potential access to mineral resources. In 2017, Russia opened a military base in its northernmost territory, the Franz Josef Land archipelago, north-east of Svalbard.
Norway (a NATO member), Russia (not) and other European nations with vested interests in the Arctic have co-existed vis-a-vis Svalbard, with fishing, including for snow crabs, among subjects of open disagreement from time to time. Norway has set up a fisheries protection zone in the 200 nautical miles around Svalbard but its right to do so under the treaty is contested.
Snow crabs are one thing. But rights to exploit oil and gas are increasing in relevance, says Professor Rothwell. On this, the treaty is silent.
""Because the treaty was concluded in 1920, it doesn’t adequately reflect the development of international law and, in particular, the law of the sea,"" he says. ""Norway says, ‘Well, the treaty says we’re the sovereign so we’re entitled to enjoy these maritime zones'.""
Oil and gas are not the only potential prizes at stake. In January, local media reported the discovery of minerals including copper, zinc, gold and silver estimated to be worth billions of dollars on the seabed near Svalbard.
Activities for ""warlike purposes"" are not allowed under the Svalbard Treaty, which expressly prohibits ""naval bases"" and ""fortifications"" on the archipelago. The language is not as comprehensive as in treaties on Antarctica and outer space, which must be used expressly for ""peaceful purposes"". Norway has one of its frigates visit Svalbard annually as a demonstration of its sovereignty, notes Simon-Butler, but it does not conduct drills there.
In such a strategically important part of the world, the potential for tensions remains.
What's next for Svalbard?
""For us biologists,"" says Rupert Krapp, ""coming to Svalbard allows us to access the European high Arctic – tundra ecosystems, fjords, and the Arctic Ocean. Geologists, geophysicists, and other researchers come here to conduct fieldwork, measurements and sampling. Other parts of the Arctic are typically much less accessible, and often do not have the same technical infrastructure in place, and certainly not at the same standard and concentration as in the settlements of Svalbard.""
China opened its first research station on Svalbard in 2003; India opened one in 2008, adding an underwater observatory in 2014. Italy, Poland, Britain and, of course, Norway are among other countries that also have stations in Svalbard.
There is much change to observe. The Arctic is warming about twice as fast as the global average, says the Norwegian Polar Institute, with temperatures in the south-west of Svalbard projected to rise 2 degrees by 2050 – double that in the north-east. Even parts of the Global Seed Vault has had to be revamped after unseasonably heavy rain leaked through weakened permafrost and into its entrance tunnel.
Australian polar wilderness guide and former Longyearbyen resident John Rodsted has seen the changes firsthand over 18 years if visiting Svalbard. The permafrost is melting into a dirt slurry in places. ""You can go into waist-deep mud,"" he says.""The Arctic is absolutely falling apart in front of our eyes.""
Tourism is thriving. Some fly in, some come by ship. About 45,000 cruise ship passengers arrived in 2018 and another 17,000 travelled on expedition cruises, according to the Association of Arctic Expedition Cruise Operators. A polar bear was shot dead after it attacked a cruise ship guard who had gone onshore to secure the area for tourists in 2018. In January, a cruise operator was fined for breaching environment protection laws by dropping anchor close to a cliff of nesting birds.
Krapp expects to see a shift in the next 10 years from short stays by large cruise ships towards ""a more exclusive and quality-focused regime where smaller cruise vessels bring tourists who stay longer and spend more locally"". (He would also like to see more renewables and zero-emission technology for settlements and stations on Svalbard.)
As for the treaty itself, Simon-Butler believes it will become increasingly visible in the next century as more nations take an interest in the Arctic. China now describes itself as a ""near-Arctic state"", he points out. On top of this, he says, ""as a treaty that any country can sign, it provides the sole location in the Arctic where all countries can legally establish a foothold to engage with the emerging Arctic economy"".
Professor Rothwell says ""as competition for Arctic resources intensifies not only amongst states like Norway and Russia, but new players like China, Svalbard will become an important Arctic test case as to how international legal frameworks can hold in the face of geostrategic rivalry"".
On February 4, Moscow requested a meeting with Oslo to discuss ""restrictions"" not in keeping with the treaty, including ""the illegality of the establishment of the so-called 'fish protection zone' by Norway"" and ""the artificial expansion of nature protection zones to limit economic activity in the archipelago"".
""On Svalbard, Russia … does not intend to curtail its presence,"" said the Russian foreign ministry. ""On the contrary, we have long-term plans for strengthening, diversifying and modernising it.""
The Norwegian foreign ministry told Reuters the issues raised by Russia were ""regularly raised"" and ""well-known"".
""All activities on Svalbard are to take place within the framework of Norwegian laws and regulations.”
Meanwhile, in Longyearbyen the 100th anniversary of the treaty's signing was celebrated with activities including seminars on the topic, cake and a men’s choir performance. And for those who preferred to stay in, the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation doubled down on its ""slow TV"" format with a ""minute by minute"" cruise around Svalbard's largest island, Spitsbergen. The voyage, which can be viewed on NRK's website, runs for 13,319 minutes. Viewers might even spot a polar bear.

It turns out that Salix polaris, the polar willow, handles these tough conditions by growing as best it can in response to July temperatures — a response that researchers recorded all over the archipelago.
The polar willow (Salix polaris) may not seem like much when you look at it — just a jumble of tiny green leaves in a dense mat that pokes out of the tundra. But beyond its humble appearance, this little shrub plays an outsized role when it comes to the creatures living in the Arctic archipelago of Svalbard.
It’s not just that Svalbard’s reindeer depend on it for food. It’s also that how it grows reflects what happens with the growth of all other plants across the whole of Svalbard. Now, researchers have found that the polar willow and other plants grow in synchrony across Svalbard, in direct response to July temperatures.

Climate change is strongly impacting the Arctic environment, leading to rapid sea ice loss. In some sectors, the retreating ice edge is perceived as an opportunity to expand and develop economic activities. Previous studies show this development in the Canadian and Russian Arctic. This paper examines mobility patterns of cruise ships and fishing vessels around Svalbard, a major hotspot of maritime activity and retreating sea ice cover, in relation to sea ice variability between August 2012 and September 2019. The results show a slight overall increase in fisheries and cruise activity, as well as remarkable trends of stretching operational seasons and expanding navigational areas in these sectors. Overall increasing activity and changing mobility patterns provoke a discussion about the implications for safe navigation and sustainable management, thus raising issues of high pan-Arctic relevance.
Introduction
The polar regions are the most climate-sensitive areas in the world, and temperatures in the Arctic are rising more than twice as fast as the global average1,2. This increase in temperatures results in large changes in sea ice conditions, with both thickness and extent following negative trends1,3,4. Sea ice is a large impediment for the development of maritime activities in the High Arctic and limits the activity to seasonal operations in most areas. Therefore, the decline of sea ice is opening new opportunities for maritime activities to expand5,6,7. The fastest developing sectors are shipping, tourism and recreational craft1, resulting in an increase in the number of ships in the Arctic by 25% between 2013 and 20198. This increase in vessels entails high risks and raises strong concerns about environmental impacts and safety issues as it puts pressure on supporting infrastructures and regulations5.
Safety concerns regarding high latitude cruise tourism and fishing operations are progressively put on the political agenda, nationally and internationally. In 2017, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) implemented the Polar Code, which sets mandatory requirements for design, construction, equipment, operational, training, search and rescue and environmental protection matters for all vessels sailing in polar waters9. More recently on a national level, the Norwegian Government in its latest Svalbard strategy emphasized the need to asses preparedness and safety challenges arising from increased shipping activity around the archipelago of Svalbard10. From a pan-Arctic perspective, there is a high level of maritime activity in Svalbard waters, together with the rest of the Barents Sea, and notably the Kara Sea11,12. At the same time, the region experiences the most drastic environmental changes in the Arctic with the northward retreat of the ice edge13, the delay of winter freeze-up14, and the air temperatures rising faster than global or even Arctic average15. Svalbard, therefore, serves as a relevant case study for the development of maritime activities and environmental change, and can provide important lessons applicable to other Arctic regions.
While maritime activity around Svalbard has increased in the past decade, to date the actual developments have not been mapped in a comprehensive way. The objective of this work is to visualize and discuss the relationship between marine economic activities (cruise tourism and fisheries), and sea ice variability around Svalbard between 2012 and 2019, in order to understand the potential implications for safety and sustainable management. The study area is delimited by the Svalbard Fisheries Protection Zone (SFPZ), which reaches out to 200 nm from the coastlines and is roughly located between 72° N and 84° N, and 3° W and 38° E (Fig. 1). The analysis is based on two datasets: (1) sea ice concentration and (2) Automatic Identification System (AIS) data. These datasets are complemented with seven semi-structured interviews with industry and public policy representatives as well as sea ice service providers, which enabled us to reflect on how sea ice conditions influence decision-making in the fisheries and cruise industries.
The cruise tourism sector is an important pillar for Svalbard’s economy16 and has rapidly increased over the past decade, where the total numbers of cruise passengers rose by 73% between 2008 and 201817 (Table 2). In parallel, retreating sea ice over the summer months has resulted in a prolongation of the season18. Most studies that analyzed the relationship between sea ice and cruise tourism focus on the Canadian Arctic, where the number of these vessels has tripled since 199019. Fisheries are the dominant fleet in the Barents Sea and Svalbard area in terms of the number of vessels and their year-round operations11,20. This region is facing large climate-driven changes in fish community structure21. The most common and commercially important species in the boreal community are cod and haddock22, and their northward migration23 results in more fishing activity at higher latitudes20. This paper contributes new contextual knowledge regarding the number and mobility patterns of these sectors in the European Arctic around Svalbard.
The remaining of this paper is structured as follows. The results section analyzes the number of vessels sailing around Svalbard and the seasonal and geographical stretching of operations between August 2012 and September 2019. The discussion elaborates on how changing mobility patterns of cruise ships and fishing vessels raise concerns for safety and sustainability in Svalbard waters. The conclusion reflects on our methodological approach and outlines complementary ways to achieve a comprehensive understanding of maritime change and its potential implications in Arctic regions.
Results
Total maritime activity around Svalbard
Overall, maritime activity is increasing in the Arctic. To determine the changes in mobility patterns around Svalbard, we analyzed the number of vessels sailing in the SFPZ using AIS data. Independently of the vessels’ trajectories, each unique vessel was counted once per month, and the time series between 2012 and 2019 shows that more vessels were present in the later years (Fig. 2). However, the total annual number of vessels shows consistency over the study period (Table 1). Therefore, the same vessels are operating for longer time periods in the SFPZ, increasing monthly activity. The highest activity observed is between July and October, with an average of 165 vessels per month. July 2017 was the busiest month in the study period with 195 vessels, which is a nearly 23% increase from July 2013 (159 vessels). The lowest activity took place between January and March in all years, where an average of 66 vessels sailed per month. Overall, throughout the study period, fishing vessels have slightly increased in number (Fig. 2), while the annual number of passenger vessels has remained fairly stable (Table 1).
Fishing vessels accounted for more than half of all vessels operating in the SFPZ in each month, making it the dominant fleet in this region. The number of fishing vessels has increased since 2014 (Table 1), and while this increase in the SFPZ can likely be explained by the northward migration of important commercial boreal species, such as cod and haddock21,23, this does not reflect official catch reports for the Northeast Arctic region, showing relatively stable catches of these species over the study period24,25. Another potential explanation for the increase in the number of fishing vessels is that more vessels have become equipped with AIS transponders. The law gradually extended for fishing vessels registered in the European Union and European Economic Agreement area. Since May 2012, it is mandatory for fishing vessels of 24 m and larger to carry AIS transponders; for vessels between 18–24 m and 15–18 m, this is the case from 31 May 2013 and 31 May 2014, respectively26. As a result of these European regulations on AIS, the Northeast Atlantic region holds the highest number of fishing vessels above 24 m that send AIS signals27, and the majority of vessels under 12 m operate along the shores of continental Europe. Therefore, fishing activity in the SFPZ can be considered to be well represented by AIS data, and we expect that the AIS data does not deviate significantly from the actual growth up to 2014, nor through the rest of the study period. AIS transmission limitations still need to be acknowledged and are explained in the methods section.
Passenger vessels are classified in two main categories: oversea cruise ships and expedition cruise vessels. The first category includes larger vessels that only sail to Longyearbyen (Fig. 1a). The second category includes day-trip cruises in Isfjorden (Fig. 1a) and some pleasure craft that are equipped with AIS transponders. Activity in these two categories has developed differently over the study period. Oversea cruise ships have decreased in number while their passenger capacity increased. In 2018, the “MSC Meraviglia'' brought 6′000 people to Svalbard, making it the biggest passenger vessel to operate in the European Arctic. The number of oversea cruise ships visiting Svalbard was higher prior to 2015. Between 1996 and 2014, around 21–35 oversea cruise vessels visited Svalbard each year, whereas from 2015 to 2018 on average 15 vessels visited the archipelago annually28.
Svalbard is a popular destination and to a large extent oversea cruise tourism explains the rise of tourists visiting the archipelago (Table 2). Expedition cruise vessels, however, have increased in numbers (Table 2), but followed a trend towards smaller vessels28. This explains why the total number of passenger vessels has remained stable over the study period (Table 1). In 2015, both categories of passenger vessels decreased in number, likely due to the expansion of the ban of heavy fuel oils (HFO) that year. This ban was first introduced in the nature reserves in the east and in the national parks in the west of the archipelago in 2007 and 2009, respectively29. Today, this ban applies in the majority of territorial waters in national parks and nature reserves around the archipelago30. The difference in the total number of passenger vessels between Tables 1 and 2 is due to the fact that our AIS data exclude smaller vessels which accounts for a majority of pleasure craft, which are becoming more popular throughout the Arctic1 and are all recorded by the Governor of Svalbard, showing an increase of 42% between 2008 and 2018 (Table 2).
Stretching of the season
The data show a prolongation of the operational season for both cruise tourism and fishery activity around Svalbard. The main operational season for passenger vessels in the SFPZ was between June and August. However, expedition cruise vessels started to operate earlier in the spring as of 2015 (Fig. 2a). Taking the spring season of 2013 and 2019, the number of vessels went from zero to four in April and four to 15 in May (Fig. 2a). Fisheries were most active in the autumn months in the first part of our study period, but extended their season particularly noticeably into early summer (June/July) and early winter (December; Fig. 2b).
To enable a deeper understanding of the relationship between sea ice variability and cruise tourism and fishing activities, maps for all months in the study period were produced and investigated, which are available in the Supplementary material online. Here, we show examples from 2013 and 2017 to visualize seasonal mobility patterns (Fig. 3). These years were selected, because 2013 is the first year with complete data both for AIS and sea ice concentration, and 2017 has a particular large sea ice cover until mid-summer. Two points are important to keep in mind when reading the maps. First, the sea ice cover can change rapidly over a month’s period and the activities most likely take place in open waters or very low sea ice cover. Secondly, previous ice conditions are an important basis for long-term itinerary planning in the cruise industry. Therefore, ice conditions of summer 2016 (see Supplementary Fig. S8; Fig. S9 online) should be taken into account as well when analyzing mobility patterns and number of expedition cruise vessels in summer 2017.
This expansion of seasonal expedition cruising is also reflected in the maps (Fig. 3). In April 2017, there were three vessels sailing along the west coast up to the ice edge near 80°N (Fig. 3), which is considerable activity for this region. The stretching over the spring shoulder season could be explained by the long daylight period (the sun remains above the horizon between April and August), the larger sea ice cover, and the higher chances of wildlife observations31. These Arctic features make this season attractive for expedition cruise tourism. Oversea cruise ships have not expanded their operational season, which lasts from June through August. An industry representative argued that these vessels avoid sailing when ice can still be present in Isfjorden, while heading for Longyearbyen (Fig. 1).
For fisheries in the SFPZ, shrimp and cod are the most important species, and fishing opportunities are determined partly by the size and distribution of the stock, and the sea ice extent20. A fishery representative explained that the best season for shrimp is between late winter and early summer, while cod fisheries are the richest and most accessible during the autumn months. More intense shrimp fishery could thus explain the increase in activity to early summer (from September early in the study period to June in the later years), whereas less sea ice and better accessibility promoted more cod fishing activity into December (Fig. 2b). For example, in July 2013, 81 fishing vessels sailed in the SFPZ; this number increased by 43% in July 2017 (116 vessels, Fig. 2b), which is also visible in the maps (Fig. 3). This seasonal stretching over the summer months might have resulted in the regression of the autumn activity peak observed in the earlier years (Fig. 2a). The late winter months have not witnessed a clear change throughout the study period, where fishing activity between January and March remained fairly low, as illustrated in the February months in Fig. 3. This low activity could be explained by various reasons such as polar nights, significant sea ice cover and low ecological activity.
Change in the sailing areas
The analyses have shown a slight overall increase in maritime activity in the SFPZ and, perhaps more remarkable, a stretching of operational seasons for both sectors. In addition to this, the data show changes in the geographical areas where operators navigate. While expedition cruise vessels are seeking more opportunities to circumnavigate the archipelago, fishing activity is moving northwards. These changes in navigational areas seem to follow the inter- and intra-annual sea ice variability between August 2012 and September 2019 (Fig. 4). Around Svalbard, the sea ice is present in the east and north over the winter and spring months. The west coast is ice-free throughout the entire study period (not accounting for ice in fjord areas) and the ice edge rarely reaches south of 76°N. All interviewees confirm that they experience strong interannual variation. To analyze spatial patterns, we divided the study region into 12 different zones around the archipelago (Fig. 4e). For each zone, the monthly mean sea ice extent and the monthly number of vessels were extracted over the study period. Figure 4 illustrates two representative examples per vessel category: for passenger vessels we show the northwest (a) and Storfjorden (b); for fishing vessels we selected the northeast (c) and Storfjordrenna (d). All zones can be found in the Supplementary material online.
Circumnavigating Svalbard is popular for expedition cruise vessels and is progressively offered by companies. However, the northeast of the archipelago is only ice-free a few months per year and presents strong annual sea ice variability. Highly variable sea ice distribution makes circumnavigation an uncertain activity and challenges itinerary planning18, for which operators mainly use historical and daily ice charts from the Norwegian Meteorological Institute32. It is predicted that the ice cover around Svalbard will continue to decline15, which enables circumnavigation earlier in the season. However, an ice-free Arctic over the summer might become less attractive for tourists, as the unique icy landscapes and endemic wildlife might become more difficult to reach31. The maps illustrate that some expedition operators seem to be willing to sail to high latitudes to reach the ice edge, as the map for September 2013 illustrates (Fig. 3). However, while sea ice remains one of the trademarks of Arctic expedition cruising, it is also something that operators try to avoid. In the Storfjorden area (Fig. 4b), we see that in the years with a high sea ice cover (July 2015 and July 2019), fewer expedition vessels visited the area than during the years with low ice cover.
For oversea cruise ships, the main destination in Svalbard is Longyearbyen (Fig. 1), where they stay for ten hours before continuing their itinerary, as explained by a representative of this industry. The west coast of Svalbard remains ice-free year-round, and hence, for this region itinerary planning is hardly affected by sea ice variability. However, this sector has experienced restrictions in sailing areas due to expansion of the ban on the use of HFO. The expansion included Kongsfjorden and Magdalenefjorden (Fig. 1), which prior to 2015 could be visited by conventional cruise vessels.
For fishing activity, the observations illustrate that the majority of activity takes place in the south of the SFPZ throughout the study period (Fig. 3). The increasing number of fishing vessels in the SFPZ could be connected to the northward migration of cod23. However, a fisheries representative argued that other fisheries are not moving north as predicted. Sea ice remains an important constraint for fishing vessels, mostly in the east of Svalbard north of 77°N. In all 12 zones, fishing vessels are present when the sea ice cover is below 20%, as illustrated for Storfjordrenna and the northeast (Fig. 4). However, in the northeast (Fig. 4c) little sea ice was present between August and November 2015 and yet few vessels sailed there, which illustrates that fisheries mobility patterns are the consequence of a complex combination of factors, such as the accessibility (sailing time from the mainland), the location of the fishing grounds20,21 and the challenges related to Arctic navigation.
Our analyses show that the strong sea ice variability around Svalbard between 2012 and 2019 has impacted destination plans for expedition cruise vessels and partly determined the operational waters for fishing vessels in the north and east of the SFPZ. These increases in activity have implications for safe navigations, which, among others, calls for more accurate sea ice information in remote areas. The following section will discuss the potential implications of these changing mobility patterns to ensure safe and sustainable development of maritime activities around Svalbard.
Discussion
Climate change impacts the Arctic environment, and Svalbard is strongly impacted. Overall, the strong sea ice retreat results in more ice-free summers. Consequently, new and remote areas are becoming accessible to navigation. This leads to increased maritime traffic, and a stretching of operational seasons and areas, as illustrated here for passenger and fishing vessels in Svalbard waters between 2012 and 2019. Sailing to the northeast of the archipelago has grown in interest, which pushes cruise operators to test limits and sail close to the ice edge until circumnavigation is possible. At the same time, fishing vessels expand their operations in these remote, and more frequently ice-free waters. These developments raise concerns about the possibilities for safe and sustainable navigation and put pressure on supporting infrastructure and regulatory arrangements33.
Supporting infrastructure for safe maritime activity consist of, among others, safety and emergency response capacities, and communication and information systems. While SAR capacity around Svalbard is dimensioned to assist a fishing vessel in distress34, the main emerging challenges are (1) to adapt to vessels with growing passenger capacity35 (an issue that was emphasized with a cruise ship evacuation along the Norwegian coast, March 201936) and (2) to access increasingly remote areas, year-round (a challenge that was stressed after a fishing vessel ran aground in Hinlopen Strait (Fig. 1), December 201837). Increased activity and expanding operational seasons raise concerns for environmental protection and human safety, and pushes the limits of SAR infrastructure in place38. In its recent Svalbard strategy10, the Norwegian government emphasized the need to assess preparedness and safety challenges arising from increased shipping activity in the Arctic, and currently investments are made to improve the material infrastructure. Despite the under-dimensioning in state preparedness around Svalbard, from a pan-Arctic perspective it might be argued that Svalbard has a relatively well-developed safety infrastructure, and it can be assumed that safety preparedness in other Arctic regions is to an even larger extent a major responsibility of the operators39.
With respect to communication and information infrastructure, there are efforts to improve communication in these waters, through prioritizing high frequency radio coverage up to the North Pole40. In addition, the improvement of Arctic weather and sea ice forecasting services has gained a lot of attention since the Year of Polar Prediction41. The strong seasonal and inter-annual sea ice variability around Svalbard in parallel with increasing maritime activities has a demand-pull effect on achieving the need for accurate and reliable sea ice services42,43. End-users operating around Svalbard emphasize the need for publicly accessible ice charts to be available daily, even more so when sailing in the north and east of the archipelago. For the moment, ice charts are available on weekdays, while automated charts are published during the weekends, but there is no warranty on their accuracy44. Therefore, it is imperative to put in place opportunities for improvements towards higher resolution, accurate charts to better support maritime activity in the Arctic45. It is also essential to provide products with low-bandwidth solutions in order to be easily accessible to a wider range of vessels sailing at higher latitudes. Such sea ice information needs are dependent on the type of use46; while fishermen primarily need information about the location of the ice edge, cruise vessel operators desire more detailed information about the type of sea ice in their navigational areas.
Several governance regulations have been implemented or expanded in recent years to mitigate risks and limit human impact, such as IMO’s Polar Code, which acts as a baseline for requirements on various levels (design, construction, equipment, operational, training and environmental protection matters) for navigation in polar waters9. However, specific regulations are needed to adapt to local development of maritime activities. The HFO ban in protected areas around Svalbard acts as geographical restriction for large ships and could serve as an example for other Arctic regions. Within the IMO and the Arctic Council, there is growing discussion to ban HFOs throughout the Arctic47, which would be an important step forward in sustainable navigation. With regard to the predicted growth in cruise tourism in the Arctic5,11, in January 2020 the Norwegian Maritime Authority implemented specific regulations for passenger ships sailing in protected territorial waters, which account for 87% of all territorial waters around Svalbard48. These additional regulations include the prohibition of discharge of sewage and gray water within 500 m off land and the prohibition of sea traffic in bird sanctuaries between May 15 and August 1549,50. Hence, while maritime development around Svalbard will partly be shaped by future ice conditions, its sustainability and trends will largely depend on international and national policy developments16,51.
Despite ongoing work to enhance supporting infrastructures and sharpen regulations, and thus the growing controllability of maritime traffic around Svalbard, this might invite for a further increase in activities in the decades to come. Indeed, some argue that environmental concerns are unlikely to lead to very strong restrictions and limitations of exploitation of Arctic resources52. It will be highly relevant to follow the implementation of the Norwegian government’s recently updated ocean strategy as well as its High North strategy10,53, and what these imply in terms of safety and sustainable maritime development around Svalbard. Despite ongoing efforts at national and international levels, navigation in these areas will always remain challenging due to persisting seasonal darkness, remoteness and potentially hazardous weather and sea-ice conditions. Still, the development of SAR capacity and communication and information systems are ascending on the political agenda, not only because of the increasing local and destination traffic as illustrated in this paper, but also due to the projections of Svalbard’s strategic future location along a potential Arctic trade route over the North Pole54.
Conclusion
This paper has provided insights into the development of maritime activity around Svalbard, and has presented an approach that will be relevant to understand transformations in other Arctic regions. The combination of vessel tracking data through AIS and sea ice data have enabled us to provide novel regionally contextualized insights about trends in Arctic shipping activity and how these relate to climate change. To conclude, we outline complementary ways to achieve a comprehensive understanding of maritime change and its implications in Arctic regions, serving to guide safety and sustainable development.
We approached maritime change by focusing on unique vessel activity per month, which has primarily provided an enhanced understanding of expanding sailing areas and seasons. Naturally, there are several other possible approaches with AIS data, such as measuring the total distance sailed by all vessels per category, which would be crucial information in the dimensioning of safety and response capacity.
In the Arctic, investments in satellites recording AIS signals are growing, making higher temporospatial resolution data accessible. This increases the possibilities to analyze mobility patterns in determined areas over shorter time periods (e.g. weekly timeframes), which would elucidate vessel’s behavior in proximity to the ice edge and in the marginal ice zone.
Developments in the marginal ice zone are very relevant to follow, since this dynamic zone between open ocean and dense pack ice will continue to expand in the summer55 and is predicted to be an interesting place for maritime activity31, but highly challenging in terms of risk and safety.
We were particularly interested to understand changes in the cruise tourism and fisheries sectors, which provided us with the possibility to reflect upon some of the dynamics that are at play in each of these sectors. Naturally, a more comprehensive picture of maritime change would include several sectors, such as cargo shipping, research, military and surveillance activities. Past trends can be understood by using the wealth of AIS data that have been generated in the past years. However, not all vessels carry AIS transponders, and a mapping of all vessels is vital for understanding the overall safety challenges in the Arctic, especially since more and more pleasure yachts are exploring the area.
A comprehensive study of maritime activity trends increases in value when past trends are analyzed in line with projected maritime change, which might include a focus on foresight and scenario studies and a scrutiny of government and business strategies for industrial innovation and development for any particular region. Such a comprehensive understanding can lead to a better overall picture of maritime transformations in Arctic regions and the risks and uncertainties these entail.
Methods
Sea ice data source and limitations
This study used daily sea ice concentration data from ARTIST Sea Ice (ASI) algorithm applied to Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR2) from the open dataset of the University of Bremen56. AMSR2 has been delivering sea ice concentration data since August 201256, which sets the beginning of the study period. AMSR2 has a horizontal resolution of 6.25 km and has a specific grid over the Earth. For each grid point the average sea ice concentration is calculated by ASI and is associated with coordinates representing the center of the grid point. However, this resolution presents some limitations close to land, where coastal reflection was detected as sea ice. This limitation does not affect the study, as ice cover in fjords is not considered in this study.
AIS source
AIS is a precise satellite-based source of data continuously recording spatial ship traffic. Initially established by IMO as a safety measure at sea for large commercial ships to avoid collision, AIS first became effective by the end of 200457. Since, AIS has been growing in interest for coastal states to ensure safety and used more frequently as a tool to establish sustainable management of maritime activities58. Several studies have analyzed mobility patterns with AIS data on a global scale59 and in the Arctic11,60. In this study, AIS data from vessels operating around Svalbard between August 2012 and September 2019 were obtained from the Norwegian Coastal Administration (NCA). Monthly files had the following information; Maritime Mobile Service Identity (MMSI) number, IMO number, name of vessel, vessel length, timestamp (UTC), longitude, latitude, speed over ground, course over ground, true heading (determines geographical direction in degree 0–360), navigation status, message number (class A: 1–3; class B: 18,19) and source (satellite/ground). Both commercial and recreational vessels are included in this dataset, which are categorized by class A and class B respectively. AIS signals are recorded every 2 s to 10 minutes61, depending on vessel class and navigational status, and whether signals are detected by satellite or ground receptors. The NCA uses AIS data from four satellites to monitor vessel traffic off Norwegian and Svalbard coasts. As AIS data are publicly available (upon request) not all vessel information is provided. Therefore, to obtain ship type information on vessels sailing in the SFPZ a special request was done; this second dataset excluded vessels under 15 m. In this study, the IMO number was used to merge the AIS and vessel type information data. We processed over 120 million AIS signals and used the IMO number, timestamp (UTC), longitude, latitude, and vessel type to determine mobility patterns around Svalbard.
AIS limitations
AIS data are not homogenous time series due to satellite limitations, technology innovations and transponder problems. Satellites are crucial to receive signals beyond the limits of coastal receptors; however, signals will not be detected if the satellite is out of reach or if the vessel is near a geographical barrier. The investment in new satellites has led to an increase in the frequency of signals between 2012 and 2019. The four AIS satellites in Norway were launched at different periods: AISSat-1 in July 2010, AISSat-2 in July 2014, NorSat-1 and NorSat-2 in July 201761. Multiple satellites allow for a more continuous registration of AIS signals, whereas only one satellite results in gaps in the data when orbiting the globe. Furthermore, AIS data are susceptible to problems related to the AIS transponder, issues stemming from modifications by users, and errors in the transmission, reception, storage and decoding of information62. Among these limitations, two in particular affected our analyses: (1) vessel information such as the IMO number filled in by the crew can hold some errors, therefore some vessels were not categorized and therefore excluded from analysis; (2) the poor satellite coverage at high latitudes may limit the position registered and lead to loss of the northernmost positions.
Measuring maritime activity
To measure maritime activity in SFPZ we counted the number of unique vessels sailing in the area, using the AIS data where each vessel has a unique IMO number. Each IMO number is counted once per month even if the same vessels sailed multiple times through the SFPZ in that time period. The delimitation of the SFPZ is roughly from 72°N to 84°N and 3°W to 38°E (Fig. 1). For each month, these vessels were categorized by passenger vessels (combining oversea cruise ships and passenger vessels), fishing vessels, and all other categories were grouped together, which include bulk carriers, container ships, icebreakers, etc.
Mapping method
To visualize the relationship between passenger and fishing vessels with sea ice variability, a series of maps were made. These maps of ice concentration and ship tracks were created with python 3.7, using basemap (1.2.0), matplotlib (3.0.2), numpy (1.15.4) and pandas (0.23.4) libraries, and using a Polar Stereographic projection. Each map shows the monthly mean sea ice extent as well as all passenger and fishing AIS signals detected that same month. The monthly mean sea ice concentrations were calculated from the daily AMSR2 grid. In this study, the ice edge is delimited at 15% ice concentration, and below this limit is defined as open water. On the maps, the boundaries of sea ice concentration are at 15%, 30%, 45%, 60%, 75%, 90% and 100% (Fig. 3). The colors associated are from cmocean (2.0)63, here the ice colormap was selected from the cmocean gallery. Concerning AIS signals, in order to compare mobility patterns throughout the study period, vessel positions are shown with a frequency of 60 min on the maps. This allowed a better comparison between earlier and later years, due to satellite innovations explained above. In total 86 months were analyzed and ten maps (February, April, July, September and November of 2013 and 2017) are presented in this paper. In this study, 2013 is the first complete year of both AMSR2 sea ice concentration and AIS data. 2017 has a particular high sea ice cover over the summer season and is of particular interest to analyze. The selected months in this paper allowed us to give an overview of both seasonal sea ice variability and mobility patterns. All maps between August 2012 and September 2019 can be found in the Supplementary material online.
Time series method
For further analysis of the relationship between sea ice variability and mobility patterns around the archipelago, 12 different zones were defined (Fig. 4e). The size and limits of these zones were determined by the sea ice extent and sailing areas of interest for fishing and passenger vessels based on map observations between August 2012 and September 2019. For each zone a time series showed the monthly sea ice extent and the number of unique vessels per month throughout the study period. The AMSR2 grid was used to calculate the monthly mean sea ice cover. Each of the 12 determined zones has a specific number of AMSR2 grid points that was constant throughout the study period. The percentage of relative sea ice cover in each zone was defined as the number of the AMSR2 grid points that were above 15% sea ice concentration. From the daily sea ice cover, the monthly mean and standard deviation were calculated. The mean sea ice cover allowed to visualize yearly sea ice variability whereas the standard deviation gave additional information on monthly and seasonal sea ice variability. To determine the number of passenger or fishing vessels, each unique IMO number is counted once, independently of the number of times the same vessel crosses the zone in that time period. In this paper four zones are visualized; the northwest and Storfjorden with passenger vessels, and the northeast and Storfjordrenna with fishing vessels (Fig. 4). The larger fjords of Isfjorden and Wijdefjorden have been excluded from zones analysis (shaded areas in Fig. 4e), due to uncertainties related to the AMSR2 resolution as explained above.
Interviews
The first author conducted seven semi-structured interviews in Longyearbyen and in Tromsø (Norway) over the summer and autumn months of 2018. The participants were captains, sea ice researchers and representatives of fisheries and cruise tourism organizations in the Svalbard and Barents Sea area. These key informants were selected based on their role in decision-making and guidance for the fishing and cruise tourism industries operating around Svalbard. The structure of the interviews allowed to cover important themes around the use of sea ice services around Svalbard, but also gave the participants the freedom to add information they believed important as well. Main themes concerned changes in sea ice variability, vessel traffic, the type of sea ice information used in decision-making and the challenges around operating in waters around Svalbard in the future. All interviews were conducted with the participants’ consent, were all held in person, and most interviews lasted around 30 min. The interviews were conducted in English, which did not result in any language barrier as most Norwegians are fluent in English. Handling and management of the qualitative interview data followed the requirements of the Norwegian Centre for Research Data.

A recently launched satellite monitoring programme suggests that a voluntary international trawling moratorium off the coast of the Svalbard archipelago is proving effective.
Details of the programme are included in the latest sustainability report by Espersen, one of the world’s leading processors of white fish, and one of the pioneers of the Industry Group Agreement to Cod Fishery.
The agreement also involved fishermen from Norway and Russia, gaining the backing of the governments of both countries, as well as NGOs including Greenpeace, and major brands, such a McDonald’s. In order to check on whether the 91 Norwegian and Russian trawlers operating in this remote region of the Northeast Atlantic were complying with the agreement, in July a satellite monitoring programme of all fishing activities in the areas covered by the agreement was launched. And Espersen have revealed that during the first six months of monitoring only one vessel has been found to possibly flaunt the agreement.
“The monitoring programme demonstrates that such a multi-stakeholder agreement can be backed-up by concrete results,” explained Alex Olsen, Espersen’s Head of Sustainability, “and any vessel found to violate the terms of the agreement more than once will be found out and expelled from the group.”
The fisheries moratorium was lauded by a number of NGOs, winning Blue Marine Foundation’s 2017 Responsible Business Ocean Award, and Olsen is determined that the company can go on to help improve catching practices globally.
“Thanks to the initiative, pristine areas around the Svalbard archipelago will be protected from trawlers until the status of the ecosystems has been established. The goal is to ensure that long-term decisions based on science — rather than the short-term pursuit of profits — are the basis for dictating which parts of this area can be sustainably exploited for seafood harvesting,” said Alex.
The company hope that the Svalbard blueprint is one that can be rolled out in other parts of the world.
""It’s a project that rightly won a major international award and we intend to follow it up by initiating similar projects in other areas where our suppliers may one day fish,"" added Klaus Nielsen, Espersen's CEO.
The Espersen-inspired moratorium in this region of the Northeast Atlantic is by no means an isolated example of their commitment to improving the way their suppliers fish.
“This line of work supports Espersen’s long-term vision of Net Positive Fishing — a concept we developed in 2016 to direct our efforts towards ensuring a future where sustainably harvested seafood is the norm. This includes demonstrating industry leadership for ocean preservation, showcasing the benefits of seafood and fundamentally changing the very methods by which our fish are caught. This year we continued to share the concepts developed during our 2016 disruptive gear technology workshop, taking designs involving lasers and drones to industry and sustainability conferences in the US and New Zealand. We are a on a long-term mission to ensure we can continue to provide delicious, healthy and affordable food from our oceans to meet the ever-growing demand. To achieve this, we firmly believe we have to entertain radical new ideas and continue to challenge the status quo. This is why we say sustainability is about future-proofing both our company and our industry,” Alex explained. . Satellites Validate Svalbard Cod Moratorium

reuters,https://www.reuters.com/article/aker-hydrogen-idUSL8N2KP2WO ,"OSLO, Feb 19 (Reuters) - Norway’s Aker group on Friday launched a new hydrogen-focused company which it plans to list on Oslo small-cap market Euronext Growth, it said, as it seeks to capitalize from rising demand for green energy.
Aker Clean Hydrogen (ACH) aims to reach net 5 gigawatt (GW) installed capacity of emissions-free hydrogen production by 2030, with net 1.3 GW already under development, Aker Horizons AKH-ME.OL, Aker's renewable energy arm, said.
The plans include a 450 MW hydrogen production facility at Yara’s ammonia plant in Norway, supplying hydrogen to replace coal in the Arctic Svalbard archipelago, as well as potential projects in Chile and Uruguay.
“With the launch of ACH, Aker Horizons is... addressing a massive market poised for global growth, with an opportunity to have an impact on significant CO2 reductions,” Aker Horizons’ Chief Executive Kristian Roekke said.
Emissions-free hydrogen could be produced by splitting water molecules with an electric current generated by renewable energy sources, or by “reforming” natural gas in combination with carbon dioxide (CO2) capture and storage facilities (CCS).
Hydrogen is seen as an energy source which could replace natural gas in power generation, fuel long-haul transport and help decarbonize such industries as chemicals and steel.
Most of the hydrogen in the world is produced from natural gas, but the process emits CO2 and is not sustainable. Production of so-called “green” hydrogen from water however has been more expensive.
Aker Horizons said ACH’s goal was to reduce the production cost of clean hydrogen to $1.5 per kilogram by 2030, a level competitive with gas and coal, compared with around $5 per kilogram today.

Activities
The goal of this Albatros Expeditions voyage is to circumnavigate Svalbard, a bucket list item for many!
During the adventure we will enjoy the immense beauty of Svalbard on this high Arctic voyage among whales, walruses, polar bears and millions of sea birds. We approach the polar bear´s favorite summer residence, as we cruise to 80 degrees north, getting as close as possible to the pack ice north of Svalbard. How far north we reach, and the exact route will depend on the ice conditions, while the many amazing locations along the coasts of Svalbard’s islands are kept navigable by the warm Gulf Stream. Onboard Ocean Atlantic you will experience areas of Svalbard not easily accessible otherwise. But we are not only cruising in the far north, we will also visit some extraordinary locations in the eastern part of Svalbard with Edgeøya and in the south part of Spitsbergen like Bellsund and Hornsund.
During the short summer, wildlife such as reindeer is busy amassing energy for the icy polar winter.
The cliffs shimmer with life as every surface is populated with countless birds - in a few months, the new generation of arctic sea birds is ready to leave their nests. The prolific bird life can be further witnessed in the form of arctic guillemots, black guillemots and razorbills fishing in the wake of our ship. On several shores, the huge walruses enjoy the short Arctic summer as well as many whales and seals foraging along the edge of the pack ice and the coasts. In the fleet of Zodiac dinghy boats, we are able to view wildlife at close proximity. The Zodiacs allow us to have frequent shore landings and embark on exploratory mini cruises in the fjords and glacial landscapes.
Enjoy the immense beauty of Svalbard on this Arctic adventure cruise among whales, walruses, polar bears and millions of sea birds. Experience high summer in the Arctic with Ocean Atlantic - one of the few ice-class expedition ships built to withstand the North Pole’s pack ice.
Day 1
Longyearbyen, Spitsbergen. Embark the Ocean Atlantic
Arrival to Longyearbyen, Capital of Svalbard – possibly the northernmost ‘real’ town in the world.
Our vessel, Ocean Atlantic, is docked close to the town center. After boarding and a welcome drink, the Expedition Leader will provide information about the voyage, the ship's daily routines and the various security and safety procedures. Before sailing, there will be a mandatory safety drill. The Captain then takes the ship out of Advent Fjord and our Arctic adventure commences.
Day 2
Ny Ålesund, Ny London and Lilienhöök glacier
During the ‘night’ (what is night, when the sun never sets?), we have passed Prins Karls Forland and have arrived in the magnificent Kongsfjord. Our visit to Svalbard is in the early summer and this is both the challenge and gift of this special voyage. Winter ice will possibly block the inner waters of many fjords, but this will give us the best opportunities to observe the omnipresent – but still elusive – polar bear, hunting for seals in its prime habitat. At this time of year the migrating birds have just arrived. They are all eager to settle and feed to get the best start for the coming hectic summer months.
Our first landing will be at Ny Ålesund. This settlement is in fact further north than Longyearbyen, making it THE northernmost town. But… is a group of scientific stations, a post office and a single shop open for a few hours a real town? You will have to judge for yourself. The setting is nice, the scientific projects are very interesting, and so is the town history. The Captain will try to get alongside, so we can enjoy an easy walk through the area.
In the afternoon, we continue further north into the fjord system, and depending on the ice situation, we may do a Zodiac cruise along the Lilliehöök Glacier front… or enjoy a lecture.
Day 3
Former whaling station at Smeerenburg and Ytre Norskøya
We have now entered North West Svalbard, which was declared a national park in 1973. The day could begin with a slow cruise in Danskergattet, looking for seals in Virgohamna, before crossing from Danskøya to Amsterdamøya to make a landing at Smeerenburg, the legendary whaling town of 17th century. 200-plus men were living – and quite often dying – here in the heyday of blubber production.
There are several interesting places to visit in this northwestern corner of Spitsbergen. If conditions allow we’ll make a landing on Ytre Norskøya, where whalers would have their lookout posts.
Day 4
Monaco Glacier and cruising towards the pack Ice
During the night we head to Wood Fjord and its branch, the Liefde Fjord. Our plan is to embark on a cruise along the broad glacier front of Monacobreen. This gives a unique insight of the glacial forces and the unlimited forms of icebergs. The ice front is named after Albert I of Monaco, who was a major sponsor of Svalbard research.
During the afternoon the ship will steer far north towards the edge of the polar pack ice. How far north only time and weather will tell, but the main target for us is just the ‘edge’, possibly at 80 degrees north! This is the kingdom of the polar bear! As the pack ice retreats during summer, polar bears ride the floes north, as this is where their prey - the seals - resides. Bears who for unfortunate reasons do not ‘catch’ the ice moving north, are stranded on Svalbard all summer, and will have to sustain on berries, eggs and whatever whale cadavers they can find. A hard life indeed!
Day 5
Sjuøyane and drift ice, polar bear country at 80 degrees around eastern Svalbard
During the day, lectures on polar mammals, environment and/or culture can be enjoyed on board in the Viking Theater. Should we get into the pack ice where the sea usually is calm, our Captain will cruise slowly between the floes to look for wildlife.
The part goal of the day is to reach the island Nordaustlandet and hopefully its 7 (or 9, depending on how you count) smaller islands Sjuøyane in the far north of Svalbard. The almost vegetation-free, rocky islands are located around 1000 km more northernly than mainland Norway’s famous Nordkapp.
Weather permitting we will land and walk these most northern landmasses. These high Arctic islands are quite barren, with moss and lichens covering the stones. The birdlife is rich in this area and some of the rarer gulls frequent these islands, so bring your binoculars.
At the end of the day, we will start cruising towards the Hinlopen Strait that divides Spitsbergen and Nordaustlandet.
Day 6
Amazing birdlife at Alkefjellet, polar desert landscape at Torrelnesset
In the morning we arrive and cruise slowly by the famous Alkefjellet. If the weather is on “our side” we will have a good view of the steep cliffs. The whole area is home to a dense congregation of Brünichs guillemots. There is so many of the birds, that hardly an inch is free. During the summer the breeding pairs offer a wild view of frantic activity, both along the cliffs and in the sea in front.
More wildlife awaits us as we land at the polar desert landscapes of Torrelnesset. The beach here is home to a host of walruses that lay amongst each other. They feed on the clams and any other molluscs that they can find in the shallows of Svalbard’s waters.
Day 7
Through the Hinlopen Strait and Freemansundet, landing at Edgeøya
The main issue that can halt a circumnavigation of Spitsbergen is the ice situation along Hinlopen Strait. If the ice is passable we can make it through the southern edge of the Strait and cruise through Freemansundet that separates Barentsøya and Edgeøya. We enjoy the views of the massive Kapp Lee on our way and pass through into Storfjorden.
We plan to make a Zodiac landing along Edgeøya’s coast. Edgeøya is the third largest island in Svalbard with an area of more than 5000 square kilometers.
During the night we will cross the southernmost part of Svalbard, called Sørkapp. From here we will continue our way up the western coast.
Day 8
Wildlife around Hornsund at Isbjørnehamna
Now that we have passed the southern edge of Spitsbergen we arrive at the entrance to Hornsund. We will be able to see buildings around Isbjørnhamna on the northern shore. This is a polish research station, that has been here since 1957. Here research subjects are: geophysics, seismics, meteorology and the ionosphere. The work relationship between the polish researchers and the Norwegian polar institute is very good, which secures the future of the station (as long as funding continues).
The fjord is almost 30 kilometers long and many call it the most beautiful, with many glaciers that calve into the waters as well as towering mountains along the shores. The mountaintops are most often covered by dense clouds and East-Spitsbergen current often leads pack ice into the fjords mouth. In other words, we are guests in a very impressive show that unfolds before us.
Day 9
Call in beautiful Bellsund, Vårsolbukta and Calypsobyen
The west coast enjoys the warmer water coming up through the Atlantic, so winter ice should now have melted. This allows us to enter the southern fjord of Bellsund on this last full day of exploration.
Bellsund has some of the richest coal layers in Svalbard, and Svea Mine, far into the fjord, was formerly one of the biggest communities on the island. But prices went down, and the coal mine is currently being dismantled.
We will stay in the fjord entrance and make landings at the Vårsol Bay. The biggest attraction here is the little auk cliff. Tundra is richly fertilized by hundreds of thousands of little auks, which the Svalbard reindeer love to graze. We will go for a nice walk along the beach – and spot remains from early industrial eras.
During lunch, we’ll cross the fjord along the 4 km long (but quite narrow) island of Akseloya. We will make a Zodiac landing at Calypsobyen in Recherche Fjord. Coal was extracted here in the early 1900s, but the enterprise never attained full production. Today, Calypsobyen offers an exciting landing that gives visitors a glimpse of the era of Neo-Industrialism, when all opportunities for profit were tried out. A pleasant walk can be made on the tundra behind the buildings.
Day 10
Prince Karls Forland with herds of walruses around Poolepynten and into Isfjorden
During the night we have entered Forlandssundet, that separates Prince Karls Forland from Spitsbergen. Our destination is Poolepynten (Poole Point), a small headland named after the British whaler Jonas Poole. Today the area is inhabited by herds of walruses who can be seen (and smelled!) from a distance. The large mammals flaunt their tusks and whiskers, as well as their considerable bulk.
After the visit, we are southbound towards the entrance to the Isfjorden.
On our way towards Longyearbyen, we hope to get our last glimpses of wildlife as well as the truly unique landscapes of Svalbard.
Day 11
Longyearbyen, Spitsbergen. Disembarkation
Early in the morning the ship has returned to our starting point in Longyearbyen. After breakfast and farewell greetings to the expedition team and crew, disembarkation will take place. Transfer is arranged to the airport.
Please note that all the outings and landings rely on weather, sea and ice conditions being favorable both for the ship to access the areas, as for the zodiacs and kayaks to maneuver under adequate conditions, ensuring the safety of all our passengers and staff.
For this reason, during moments of harsh weather and throughout the entire trip, Ocean Atlantic has excellent public areas, such as wellness/sauna, restaurant, bar and a library for our passengers to spend their spare time. Our ship is staffed by experts in the field who will also share great lectures along the way, ranging from exploration history to biology, geology, ice and wildlife.

hyperallergic,https://hyperallergic.com/398763/photographs-of-life-in-svalbard/ ,"The Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard is one of the northernmost settlements on Earth, with life in its Arctic climate constantly up against frigid temperatures, limited resources, and isolation. Between 2013 and 2016, Julia de Cooker photographed its people, architecture, and mundane daily routines, all loomed over by the surrounding icy mountains. Svalbard — An Arcticficial Life, the book’s title a play on its Arctic setting and the artificial normalcy, is out now from Kehrer Verlag.
Cover of Julia de Cooker Svalbard – An Arcticficial Life (courtesy Kehrer Verlag)
In a book essay, the Paris-based photographer considers the surreal juxtaposition between the harsh landscape and its human inhabitants, a rotating population of scientists, miners, religious leaders, and other intrepid citizens. She writes:
Strangeness appears through different sorts of details. The combination of elements that have nothing to do with each other, or with the natural environment, is gripping. Is the presence of a limousine not surprising in a place where schools hold safety drills in case of a visit by a polar bear, where the priest moves about by helicopter, where houses so close to the North Pole have balconies? Svalbard — An Arcticficial Life is the reflection of this “strange normality.”
Svalbard may be best known for the Svalbard Seed Bank, which makes an appearance in the monograph. Nicknamed the “Doomsday Vault” it holds thousands of plant species seeds from gene banks around the world. This year it got global attention when, due to high temperatures and unusual rainfall, the Seed Bank experienced water leakage. The flooding supported international concerns about climate change, and the impact on the Arctic. Although not a focus of de Cooker’s book, the human intervention in the natural world, and the delicate relationship between the two, is in each image. It’s also something the photographer has explored in previous series, such as Kaa’boc on communities along the Tapajo river in the Amazon Rainforest, and Oh my Gold! featuringweatheredstructures from the 1992 Albertville, France, Winter Olympics.
The images in Svalbard include wide views of the frozen terrain, sometimes illuminated by the Northern Lights, where a wooden church or bus station seems ephemeral against this incredible topography. Intimate portraits capture the people who have made this landscape a home, whether a woman pushing a baby carriage over the snow, or a priest posed next to the improbable orchids blooming in his window. Some come to study Arctic science at the University of Svalbard, others are drawn to the remote area’s unique status, which de Cooker notes “allows them to live there without visas or working permits.” Punctuating the series are more ominous shots of dead reindeers and a World War II aircraft wreck, underlining the precariousness of life on this polar terrain. .

Voiced by Amazon Polly
TRONDHEIM, Norway — The energy transition has reached Svalbard, the remote Arctic islands located halfway between mainland Norway and the North Pole.
But the dueling Norwegian and Russian towns on the main island of Spitsbergen — the islands belong to Norway but Russia has mining rights under a 1920 treaty — show the vastly different approaches to the energy transition by the eastern and western halves of the Continent.
The Norwegian government announced last month that it wants to shut the tiny 10-megawatt coal-fired heat and power plant in Longyearbyen, which supplies most of the 2,500 inhabitants with electricity and district heating, within two to five years.
That sounds the death knell for mine No. 7, the last operational Norwegian-owned coal mine on Svalbard. With it goes over 100 years of coal mining, jobs and heritage.
But it's not the only coal operation on Spitsbergen. The mine at Barentsburg, the Russian settlement of 500 people, is now almost entirely used to fuel the town's power plant. With an annual production of only around 120,000 tons, it appears close to exhaustion. However, there is no sign that Arktikugol, a state-owned Russian company that began coal production on Svalbard in 1932, has plans to close it.
“As long as there is coal, the Russians will supply the power plant in Barentsburg,” said Arild Moe, a professor at the Oslo-based Fridtjof Nansen Institute.
“Barentsburg has the same challenges as Longyearbyen since coal mining there is very unprofitable,"" he said. ""The mines there are also close to being depleted. The Russians are looking for other ways to support their presence on Svalbard, for example through tourism and research centers. However, coal is still the backbone of the Russian settlement.”
And once that's gone, nuclear is a likely alternative, said Elizabeth Buchanan, lecturer in Strategic Studies at Deakin University Australia and a fellow of the Modern War Institute at West Point.
“I would expect modular nuclear power to arrive in Barentsburg in the coming decade,” she said.
The Russian reluctance to abandon coal mirrors the sentiment in much of Central and Eastern Europe, where governments are reluctant to rapidly shut down coal — something that's happening in much of Western Europe.
The calculation is very different in Noway, a country that has grown rich thanks to its vast deposits of oil and gas, but which now wants to green its economy while not halting fossil fuel exports.
Coal prices on world markets are now too low to make coal mining on Svalbard profitable. Store Norske, the state-owned company that owns the mine, is bracing for the future by developing expertise in new areas; tourism, logistics, property and renewable energy.
The company’s coal production is now roughly around 100,000 tons a year, down from a peak of around 4 million tons in 2007. Keeping mine No. 7 operational after the closure of the power plant is not an option, the company said.
But dropping coal doesn't mean an easy transition to renewables; wind and solar cannot do the job alone, at least not before hydrogen and storage solutions are rolled out at scale. Onshore wind faces hefty opposition from local residents and solar power has obvious limitations in a place that sees months of winter darkness.
“Wind power is not a popular alternative among residents and environmental authorities. Solar power is an interesting option during summer, but Svalbard has five months with virtually no sunlight which is when electricity is needed the most,” said Gunnar Sand, vice president projects with Norway-based research organization SINTEF.
“It will be difficult to close down the coal-fired power plant in Longyearbyen entirely at this time. A number of renewable alternatives have been tabled; wind power, solar, hydrogen, geothermal and even a power cable from mainland Norway. But none of these can replace coal alone, it would take a combination of several technologies,” he said.
Climate change
The power plant in Longyearbyen emits about 70,000 tons of CO2 per year, which isn't a huge amount but it is symbolic. The Arctic is very exposed to climate change with rising temperatures, increasing rainfall and melting ice posing a risk to local wildlife and ecosystems — the archipelago counts around 3,000 polar bears.
There is no shortage of ideas when it comes to renewable energy. Statkraft, the Norwegian state-owned power company, has proposed using wind power in northern Norway to make hydrogen and ammonia which can be shipped to Svalbard to fuel a power plant. But getting that done by 2025 looks optimistic. A battery park on Svalbard is also being mulled.
“It will be difficult to replace coal with renewable energy at present. Gas is perhaps the most feasible solution in the near term,” said Moe.
Sand said a gas-fired plant will probably require a carbon capture and storage (CCS) facility. But CCS could have been installed at the existing coal-fired plant as well, thus eliminating the need to import gas.
“Our research at the University Center in Svalbard has shown that it is possible to store CO2 underneath the existing power plant. But the government has ruled out the option of coal with CCS,“ he said.
The future of Russian coal isn't looking that bright either. Russia has rights to coal mining in other areas of Svalbard, but building new mines would be very costly and seems unlikely to happen.
Despite the lack of an economic rationale for keeping a presence on Svalbard, Russia sees a political interest in retaining a footprint on the islands. Moscow has challenged Oslo’s administration in the past, with squabbles over Norway’s protection of the archipelago’s fishing zone.
“The Russian settlement on Svalbard is mostly symbolic. Moscow sees it as a guarantee that Svalbard will not be used as a threat against it,” said Moe. “Svalbard could possibly have been used as a military base after WWII, but developments in military technology have reduced Svalbard’s offensive potential to practically nil. In other words, Svalbard is not as strategically important as before, but a power like Russia does not need many excuses to maintain its presence.”
Buchanan noted that Russia’s mineral rights in Svalbard are not limited to coal. The treaty also gives Moscow access to other minerals such as iron, copper, zinc and precious metals.
“There are plenty of viable resources up for grabs. And by way of the treaty, signatories have rights to mine them,” Buchanan said, adding: “While the population of Russian settlements in Svalbard has slightly declined, Kremlin interest certainly has not.”

troyhunt,https://www.troyhunt.com/project-svalbard-have-i-been-pwned-and-its-ongoing-independence/ ,"This is going to be a lengthy blog post so let me use this opening paragraph as a summary of where Project Svalbard is at: Have I Been Pwned is no longer being sold and I will continue running it independently. After 11 months of a very intensive process culminating in many months of exclusivity with a party I believed would ultimately be the purchaser of the service, unexpected changes to their business model made the deal infeasible. It wasn't something I could have seen coming nor was it anything to do with HIBP itself, but it introduced a range of new and insurmountable barriers. So that's the tl;dr, let me now share as much as I can about what's been happening since April 2019 and how the service will operate in the future.
In the Beginning, There Were 141 Companies
According to the lock screen, I took the photo below at 04:49 on the 24th of July last year. I was in yet another bland, nondescript hotel room, drinking bad coffee in an attempt to stave off the jet lag. I'd arrived in San Francisco a few days earlier after barely making my connection in Helsinki, literally running through the airport. My bag hadn't made it. I was tired, alone, emotional and if I'm honest, at an all-time low. I snapped this pic to remind me how much energy I was pouring into the project when I came out the other side, whatever the outcome may be.
One day I'd really like to turn this whole experience into a conference talk because it's a fascinating story, but for now I want to try and give a sense of just how intense the last 11 months has been, starting with the heading above. Per the Project Svalbard announcement blog post, I engaged KPMG to run the merger and acquisition (M&A) process for me. Between their outreach to suitable organisations and the inbound requests from others after writing the announcement blog post, we spoke to a total of 141 different companies from around the globe. (The total number of organisations under consideration was actually significantly higher than that, but we culled all those we didn't consider ""Tier 1"" or in other words, highly likely to be a good fit for HIBP.) These were companies spanning all sorts of different industries; big tech, general infosec, antivirus, hosting, finance, e-commerce, cyber insurance - I could go on. The point is the net was cast very wide.
We whittled the original 141 companies down to the 43 that were best aligned to the goals I outlined in the original blog post. As I've said throughout this process, the decision around who I wanted to entertain as a bidder for the service was always going to be mine and mine alone so I culled companies that I didn't believe should have responsibility for the sort of data HIBP has, that wouldn't shepherd the service in the direction I believed it should go or were simply companies that I didn't want to work for. That last point is critical - it was repeated over and over again by every single organisation we discussed it with that a sale of HIBP was also a sale of me for many years to come. I would be an employee. I'd fly the company flag. I'd need to support their vision. That was only ever going to happen with a company that I wanted to devote many years of my life to. So, in late July I flew to San Francisco and spent a couple of weeks meeting with those 43 companies, KPMG guys in tow. It all felt a bit, well...
Seriously, I vividly remember after one early meeting on-premise with a tech company, walking out of the building with the KPMG guys laughing about how much it felt like an episode of Silicon Valley! Over and over again, we'd go to these meetings and sit across the table from characters that could have come straight out of the show. The Russ Hannemans, the Gavin Belsons, the Lori Breens and here's me, feeling all Richard Hendricks. I hope I was a bit more articulate than Richard, but I was someone fronting up and presenting my pride and joy to strangers who I hoped would share the same enthusiasm for it that I did. I make the Silicon Valley comparison only partly tongue-in-cheek because it was absolutely uncanny how true the experiences tracked to the comedy.
The 43 companies we met with all received an information memorandum (IM):
An Information Memorandum (IM) is a package of documents created by business owners for prospective buyers. The primary mandate of an Information Memorandum is to motivate potential investment into your business. Although this package is designed to draw the interest of prospective buyers, it dually serves the purpose of transparency. Owners should avoid exaggeration, and aspire to disclose any information that will materially affect the value of the company.
In other words, you're trying to provide as much information as possible about the business so that potential purchasers can simultaneously understand what it does, see where the future potential is, foresee any risks, value it and ultimately put forward a bid.
Tangentially to the IM, one thing that worked in my favour when it came to providing information about how HIBP operates is that because I've run it with such transparency for so long, a lot of questions had already been answered publicly. For example, I was regularly asked if I'd ever received any legal threats which is apparently pretty normal for any M&A process, but you can imagine why it'd be particularly interesting when dealing with a heap of data originally obtained via illegal methods. No, I've never received any legal threats of substance (for example, I've never received a letter from a legal representative threatening to take action against me), the closest example I could think of I'd already included in one of my talks (deep-linked to the ""high priced lawyers"" point in the video):
I never heard anything further from Adult Fan Fiction 🙂
The IM description goes on:
Information Memorandums tend to be very exhaustive as they should include items relating to the financial standing, assets and liabilities, business description, market position, clients, strategies and promotion methods, markets served, etc. of the company.
""Exhaustive"" doesn't even begin to explain the effort that went into the Project Svalbard IM. We spent months preparing the document, regularly working until all hours to flesh it out as comprehensively as possible.
Looking back through the IM now, it had everything from traffic stats to revenue to assets to debts (none!) to customers to noteworthy events since conception to a slide on ""Industry Tailwinds"" talking about how big cyber is becoming (that hurt a little bit to put my name on, so much cyber...). Here's a page from it that was intended to pimp my own personal credentials:
This was another really unexpected part of the experience - how people perceived me personally and put a value on my brand. I was really conscious that the companies weren't bidding for HIBP, they were bidding for me running HIBP so a significant part of the purchase price was quite literally a dollar figure on my head. A little while back I had a discussion with someone who wanted to collaborate as they weren't getting the traction they wanted when pitching their own product to major tech firms. He made the following comment about trust:
I kid you not, was in a meeting at [big tech company] HQ in [HQ location] and a comment was made to the effect that ""there is only one service they trust as a white hat (Troy and HIBP) and I'm like ""fuck how does one guy corner the market on trust?""
This is what the organisations bidding on HIBP were buying: trust in me. Anyone can cobble together a website with some APIs and load in a ton of data breaches, but establishing trust is a whole different story. Trust in the way I run the service is an absolutely pivotal part of HIBP and it's something I built organically rather than setting out to earn it, now here I was with big companies putting a value on it. That felt weird in a way I've never experienced before, certainly not like in times gone by where I'd interviewed for jobs. But then it was also an exciting time where I'd walk into a meeting with a company and they'd be so enthusiastic to meet me in person after following me for years so we'd do selfies, hand out HIBP stickers and then settle into serious business discussions. It was surreal.
Reflecting on the Process in August
Time and time again throughout Project Svalbard, I questioned whether it was the right thing to do. The motives were right in that it was first and foremost for the sustainability of the project so I wasn't concerned about that, but was selling HIBP genuinely the best path forward? Was this the future I wanted? Of course, I'd considered all that before making the decision to go down this path, but nothing could prepare me for the actual emotions felt once I was eyeball-deep in the M&A process.
I had a seminal moment just after all the San Francisco meetings as I was making my way over to the Black Hat and Defcon conferences in Vegas. The in-person meetings had wrapped up but that didn't stop a never-ending stream of teleconferences (I destroyed the batteries on a set of AirPods just from Project Svalbard teleconferences). I was parked in my rental car talking to the guy who'd be my boss if the large tech company he worked for emerged as the successful bidder. He asked a question - a perfectly reasonable interview question - but it sent chills down my spine:
So Troy, explain to me what your perfect day in the office would look like.
I kid you not, the immediate thought that popped into my mind was ""I get up, get on my jet ski then do whatever the fuck I want"". I can't remember exactly how I answered the question, but I can remember how it made me feel and it was pretty damn uncomfortable. The last ""job"" I had I absolutely hated by the end of it. My boss was an arsehole (there was broad consensus on that noun), but I stuck it out and dealt with it until circumstances were such that there was a better path forward; ultimately, a redundancy with a nice payout (I cover this in my Hack Your Career talk). I love my life of independence and whilst I was prepared to work for a company again, it had to be the right company and this just felt... wrong. Many of them felt wrong.
Only a day later I received an email that reminded me how important HIBP was not just for me, but for an untold number of other people:
I asked Cody at the time if he'd mind me sharing this at a later date then dropped it into this draft blog post. I didn't know what the post would say at the time, it was either going to announce a successful bidder or announce that HIBP would remain an independent project. Either way, this email was going in there to reinforce how important the trust of those who use HIBP is to me. Whatever the outcome, I wasn't going to do anything to let the Codys of the world down.
Then I got to Vegas. I wandered the conference halls with Scott Helme for a week and time and time again had complete strangers come up to me and thank me for HIBP (they also constantly asked who the fuck the other guy was which brought a much-needed smile to my face ?). It happened dozens of times, often with much excitement, selfies and exchanges of radio waves across Defcon badges. After one such encounter, I added the following to the draft blog post with Cody's email and I'm reproducing it here precisely as I wrote it in the midst of the M&A process 7 months ago now:
I remember one discussion in particular where the guy was talking so sincerely about his appreciation and I just started thinking ""what am I doing - can I really sell this thing?""
What those experiences in August did was help me crystallise priorities. I was still determined to see the process through, but I gained a greater appreciation for just how important it was to find the right organisation. I left Vegas feeling like HIBP was much bigger than just me.
Non-binding Bids
Of the 43 companies that received the IM, a subset of those then submitted non-binding bids which essentially means ""here's the deal we'd like to do, but there's a heap of due diligence we need to do yet before making a binding commitment"". I'm going to be a little vague on that number as I honestly can't remember what I represented to each of these organisations in terms of levels of interest due to the way the bids trickled in. There was a very clear timeline to submit bids given to each potential suitor, but many of them missed it not just by hours or days but in some cases, even weeks. Unsurprisingly, some organisations elected not to submit bids at all and that was really the aim of the IM; to filter out those who were serious with proceeding from those who wouldn't ultimately be suitable. We had to ensure the 43 who received the IM was significantly chopped down.
The non-binding bids were the first time we started to get a true sense of how the various organisations valued the service. It wasn't just the headline value either, it was how much of it was comprised of cash versus equity and over what period of time it would be paid, which brings me to a really key factor in all of this: golden handcuffs. A consistent theme across all the bidding companies was that they wanted me locked in for years and if I changed my mind part way through, I'd pay for it big time. I expected that - it wasn't news to me - but I'd be lying if I said it didn't worry me once I started seeing it in writing. If I entered into one of these agreements then, for example, decided I didn't like a strategic change in direction the organisation took and decided to leave, I'd no longer have HIBP, I wouldn't be able to do anything similar for years due to non-compete clauses and I'd be financially penalised massively. That weighed more and more heavily on me as things progressed.
The non-binding bids helped us further chop down the list of suitors. There was a massive spread of valuations. Some companies wanted me to perform roles I wasn't comfortable with. Some wanted me to permanently relocate overseas. I hadn't ruled out relocation at the beginning of the process, but there were enough organisations happy for me to be anywhere that it left plenty of options open without giving up my Gold Coast lifestyle (seriously, just look at this place!)
Exclusivity: Then There Was One
Apparently, the way these M&A processes run is that as you really get down to the wire with the final bidders, eventually someone will ask for exclusivity. This grants them a window of time in which they can do extensive due diligence to the exclusion of all other bidders. That might sound a bit selfish on the face of it, but as I'd soon learn this can be a very laborious, drawn out and expensive process. A bidder who believes they're in with a good shot wants to make sure they can make that investment and have a high likelihood of coming out as the victor.
And so in September, we granted exclusivity to a bidder. Now, I'm going to be extra careful here with the words I use because even though there wasn't ultimately a sale, I signed off on all sorts of confidentially terms which prohibit me from sharing anything that might indicate who this bidder was, how much the bid was for or what the terms of the bid were. I hate to be vague (I'm usually super transparent on these things), but I'd also hate to disrespect the privacy of this organisation or land myself in hot water legally. What I will say is that it was a company that met all my criteria both as outlined in the original Project Svalbard post and so far in this one. It was a company I respected and one I had confidence would help me take HIBP in the right direction.
And so began the extensive due diligence. KPMG had warned me about this phase right at the beginning of the process and from memory, the word they used was something akin to ""onerous"". Let me try and give you a sense of just how true that word was by way of examples and I'm going to pick a handful not just from the company that had exclusivity, but from some of the earlier 43 as well. Among literally thousands of other requests (seriously - the total number was four figures), I was asked for:
- Minutes of all meetings of the board (remember, HIBP is a one-man show)
- Documented processes for when a mobile device reaches end of life (uh... I factory reset it and give it to the kids?)
- ""Documentation of the Company’s technical operations, including but not limited to platform capabilities, database servers, data center operations, network infrastructure, IT policies, SLA’s provided to customers, back-up/redundancy plans, and emergency/disaster recovery procedures""
I copied and pasted that last point verbatim - can you imagine how much information needs to go into a response to a question like that?! How HIBP runs across the various Azure services, the Cloudflare dependencies, how I recover if things go wrong and then how that's managed across different autonomous parts of the project such as the HIBP website, the Pwned Passwords service etc etc. This just isn't the sort of stuff you document in a pet project so everything had to be done from scratch.
What I was being asked for during this extensive due diligence phase wasn't coming from the folks I'd initially spoken with in the lead up to their non-binding bid, rather from the leagues of business development and legal folks behind them that needed to get involved in this process. They didn't know who I was, had likely never heard of Have I Been Pwned before this exercise and if I was to take a guess, wouldn't have even known how to pronounce it. But M&A was what they did and they were simply asking all the sorts of questions they would in any other M&A process so I can't begrudge them that. Problem is, it's one thing to get hit with those questions when you're part of a team of people, but it's a whole different thing when you're one bloke on his own.
I don't think I'll ever be able to sufficiently explain all the emotions I felt during this phase of the process. It was an endless series of questions, meetings and if I'm honest, frustration. At one stage, I sat between lawyers arguing backwards and forwards as to whether or not I was a sophisticated investor up to speed with American Securities and Exchange Commission law and if I wasn't, ""the deal's off"". I got a bill for that argument.
This went backwards and forwards for months. Every time we thought the whole thing was done there'd be more questions. More delays. Until it was over.
Then There Was... Zero
The news came very recently. Keeping in mind my previous point regarding confidentiality and choosing my words carefully, the circumstances that took the bidder out of the running was firstly, entirely unforeseen by the KPMG folks and myself and secondly, in no way related to the HIBP acquisition. It was a change in business model that not only made the deal infeasible from their perspective, but also from mine; some of the most important criteria for the possible suitor were simply no longer there. Collectively, we agreed to put pens down.
After many months of exclusivity with a single organisation and going through crazy amounts of due diligence, the effort involved in scrolling back to the September time frame and starting it all again with another organisation would have been enormous. I also didn't want a situation where I compromised my own principles; the organisation we'd identified as the best possible fit was precisely that - the best possible fit - and all other candidates would mean making concessions I simply couldn't justify. Besides, as this exercise had already demonstrated, there are absolutely no guarantees in this process and going back to square one could very easily result in many more months of effort and no outcome to show for it.
So we wrapped it up, I got the single largest bill I've ever received in my life and then I sat down and started writing this blog post. In doing so, I stopped for the first time since April 2019 and reflected on how much had happened during the process.
A Lot Happens in 11 Months
I onboarded 5 new governments onto HIBP: Austria, Ireland, Norway, Switzerland and Denmark (and a 6th one about to be announced any day now). I loaded 77 new data breaches comprising of 1.7B records into HIBP and signed up almost 400k more individual subscribers to the service. I built and launched the authenticated API and payment process (I really should have done this earlier, I'm so happy with it!)
On a more personal note, I joined the likes of Bruce Schneier, Eugene Kaspersky and Alan Turing (Alan Turing!!) in the Infosecurity Hall of Fame. I spoke at CERN. I visited 2 new countries for the first time (Israel and Hungary) and keynoted events there, plus a heap of talks in more familiar places, a bunch of workshops, I still wrote blog posts and somehow - miraculously - never missed a weekly video.
On the M&A front, I had to learn about normalised EBITDA, revenue multiples and ARR. I met literally hundreds of people in person regarding Project Svalbard during both the San Francisco meetings and travel to other parts of the US and the world.
During all of this, I still had to run HIBP in a ""business as usual"" fashion. I still manually verified every breach, hand edited every logo of a pwned company, issued (and chased) every invoice, did the tax returns and prepared the business activity statements. In other words, all the stuff I'd always done for years still had to be done regardless of how menial it was, none of that went away. I'm detailing all of this here to help explain what I need to do next...
So, What's Next for HIBP and for Me?
To be honest, I need some time to recover. What I've explained in this post will never adequately illustrate just how stressful this process was. I need some time where I'm not waking up dreading how much work will have landed in my inbox overnight. I need some time to write more code and more blog posts, two things that remain my passion but had to take a back seat during this process. I'll still keep running HIBP as I always have, but I need the head-space to get my energy levels back up and plan the next phase. I've (almost entirely) cleared my calendar for the next few months to give me that much-needed time out and with coronavirus causing a heap of conferences to be cancelled and travel plans to be disrupted, it's probably not a bad time to stay home anyway.
Having said that, there are things that have become abundantly clear during the M&A process that I'm confident will feature in that next phase. I need more support, for one. I can't be the single person responsible for everything so I'll be considering the best way to start delegating workload. That'll not only help me run the service as it stands today, but it'll help me expand it to do so many of the things I'd wanted to in a post-acquisition world. It'll also allow me to work towards no longer being the single point of failure; there has to be a contingency plan for if I get taken down in a freak drop bear accident.
One of the things I'm really excited about is a concept I've had bubbling away in the back of my mind for a couple of years now about how the industry as a whole can better tackle the flood of data breaches we're seeing. I floated this idea past each of the companies I met with during Project Svalbard and the support for it was overwhelming, even from those organisations that knew very early on they wouldn't be bidding. For those reading this that were part of those discussions, I'm determined to make it happen this year and I will be in touch!
Another area I expect to focus on a lot more is to leverage the more formal relationships I established during the process with governments, regulators and law enforcement. It's an interesting time right now where there's clearly a lot of support for HIBP and the way it operates, but also a lot of focus on privacy and people having control of their own data which poses some interesting challenges. Here's a simple example of the paradox I want to tackle with these groups: we all want privacy but we also all want to know where and how our data has been exposed and what the data is, how do we achieve both objectives? It's non-trivial for many, many reasons, but it's also important and HIBP has a role to play in the solution.
The list of all the things I want to tackle in the post-Svalbard era is lengthy and that's also why I need the downtime: to be able to focus, prioritise and take HIBP forward with more enthusiasm and energy than ever.
Summary
I saw a comment only last week on my traffic spike blog post that really brought home how much I love running this project:
You’re living the dream and you make it look good Troy.
I love what I do. This is a fascinating industry that continues to challenge me in all sorts of ways I never expected and there's not been a moment where I've felt bored or uninspired by it. To be able to continue running HIBP and shepherding it forward remains the dream, regardless of who owns it. So, I'll finish this blog post on the same note I finished the last Project Svalbard one:
I've made this decision at a time where I have complete control of the process.
And so it remains today and for the foreseeable future, with HIBP as an independently operating service designed to do good after bad things happen. Thank you for reading this far, thank you for supporting both HIBP and myself, I'm off to have that board meeting 🏄♂️

ft,https://www.ft.com/content/afcda94a-018c-11e6-99cb-83242733f755 ,"“Watch out for polar bears!” friends said when they heard I was going to Svalbard. And there I was, less than five minutes after landing at Longyearbyen airport, face to face with a huge male bear, frozen in a hunting pose, eyes fixed in a deathly stare.
OK, it was standing in the middle of the luggage carousel and it hadn’t hunted anything in a long time, aside from suitcases, given that it was stuffed. But, still — it was like Jurassic Park International having a giant model of a T-Rex in arrivals.
Many tourists travelling to this Norwegian archipelago, three hours’ flying time due north from Oslo and just 1,300km from the North Pole, come to see the islands’ 3,000 bears. Most are disappointed. The bears largely live on the pack ice, in areas fiercely protected by the Norwegian government, hundreds of kilometres north of the capital, Longyearbyen. Sightings do occur near to the city — there was the tragic case of the British schoolboy killed by a bear 40km from Longyearbyen in 2011 — but they are rare. For most visitors — 97 per cent, in fact — our friend at the airport is the closest they’ll come. Just as well, then, that a visit to Svalbard is about much more than bears.
On the drive into Longyearbyen (five minutes, on a 5km stretch of the archipelago’s 46km of roads), the driver explained a little of Svalbard’s history. Dutchman Willem Barentsz had first sighted the islands in 1596 and christened them Spitsbergen (Dutch for “sharp-peaked mountains”). From the 17th to the early 19th centuries it had been a hunting free-for-all, as the British, Dutch and Danish slaughtered the whales for oil, the polar bears for their pelts and walruses for their ivory, almost to the point of extinction. In the early 20th century an American, John Munro Longyear, discovered coal. The second free-for-all followed as mines opened up along the fiords — there was no national claim to the islands until the Svalbard Treaty of 1920. It gave Norway sovereignty, but also allowed the 13 other original signatories (now grown to 42, including Afghanistan, North Korea and Russia) the rights for their citizens to reside in Svalbard and for their nations to engage in mining there.
A global collapse in coal prices, from around $120 a tonne in 2011 to $45 a tonne today, and the costs of mining at this latitude, mean that today only three mines remain. Of those, the largest, at Sveagruva, 44km as the crow flies from the capital, is due to close later this year.
So Svalbard needs a sustainable future. And it is hoped that my busload of visitors, along with the 135,000 other tourists who will journey here this year, are a large part of it.
We arrived in Longyearbyen, population 2,100 (of the archipelago’s 2,500 total) and, at 78 degrees, the world’s northernmost town (only a couple of military and research bases are closer to the pole). We dropped our bags at the Radisson Blu Polar, the world’s northernmost serviced hotel, by now realising that the prefix “world’s northernmost” would feature a lot during our visit. (For reasons of space, it will henceforth be denoted with an asterisk.)
We headed out on a walking tour, starting at the Svalbard Brewery*, down by the Adventfjord on which Longyearbyen sits. It is owned by Robert Johansen, 57, a former miner who fought for years to overturn a 1928 brewing ban on Svalbard (authorities thought that a combination of alcohol and miners stuck in a tiny settlement might not be such a great one). In 2014 he succeeded. Today, he produces 250,000 litres a year, made mostly with water from a nearby glacier. “I thought it would be nice to have something of our own here,” he told me. “Before, we only had coal.”
We headed into town, no rough frontier place these days but full of bright buildings: schools*, restaurants*, even a Thai supermarket* (the Thai, numbering some 200, form the second-largest ethnic group on Svalbard; lovesick miners went to Thailand on holiday in the 1980s and brought back more than photographs). As we walked, our guide, Anika Paust, explained about the polar night — from roughly December 10 until mid-January Svalbard is in total darkness. From then on, each day brings 20 minutes more daylight until April 19, when the sun rises and doesn’t set again until August 23. In early March, when we were there, the sun rises high enough above the mountains to finally hit Longyearbyen. No surprise, then, that most people in the town had a look of startled wonder on their faces, as if they’d just had sacks removed from their heads.
Above us on the bleak, snow-covered valley walls stood long-abandoned coal mines, everywhere the wooden pylons of the old cableways that once brought down the coal, silent now but once filling the valley 24 hours a day with fearsome clanking and squealing.
We passed a lonely graveyard* marked with simple crosses. They stopped burials here in the 1950s, as bodies started popping up out of the permafrost in a thaw. These days you are not allowed to be born, grow old or die in Svalbard because, respectively, Norway doesn’t want to grant citizenship to any children of the 43 different nationalities who call Svalbard home, there are no elderly care facilities (when you are no longer economically productive, you must leave, a bit like Logan’s Run without the euthanasia), and there’s nowhere to bury people.
We passed the university* and former miners’ barracks, now turned into student accommodation — Svalbard, Paust explained, is now one of the world’s leading centres for climate studies — and arrived at Huset, once the miners’ community hall, now a restaurant. We removed our shoes — strict protocol in Longyearbyen, a legacy of the mining days, when not only the entire landscape was coated in coal dust but carpets, too. There we ate a seven-course tasting menu including Arctic char, Svalbard reindeer sausages and king crab, each dish accompanied by different wines from Huset’s 20,000-strong cellar. It felt weird to be eating so fabulously in a place so far from the rest of the world; like finding a good gastropub on Mars.
The next day, after a delay — one of our party was trapped in his hotel room for an hour after the shifting permafrost had jammed his door shut — we headed out on snowmobiles, destination Barentsburg, a Russian mining town some 70km away. The guides both carried rifles in case of bear encounters, a compulsory requirement for anybody leaving the city limits of Longyearbyen.
It felt weird to be eating so fabulously in a place so far from the rest of the world, like a gastropub on Mars
We rode inland alongside a frozen river and then climbed, cutting between peaks on high passes, and then dipped down again, barrelling along deep, twisting troughs like a bobsleigh run, and then out on to a boundless plain, the sky and the land utterly indistinguishable, a bleached-out world of total whiteness. Flying across the ice, the only way you could tell you were moving was by looking at the speedometer.
We stopped to photograph some Svalbard reindeer. Their ancestors are thought to have walked across from the mainland during the last ice age and they are, along with the Arctic fox, the only land mammals in Svalbard. With their stumpy legs and thick pelts, they’ve adapted superbly to conditions here, using their ice-pick-like hooves to cut through the permafrost to find the vegetation beneath. Without any natural predators (polar bears can’t chase them because they’d overheat), the reindeer are very tame. And, like the recovering numbers of whales and bears, since commercial bans on hunting them were imposed (there were thought to be fewer than 1,000 left in 1920), their numbers have recovered to around 12,000 today.
Soon after, we passed a graveyard of rusting old Soviet-era trucks and machinery and then entered Barentsburg, all signs now in Cyrillic. Next to the coal-fired power station that keeps the settlement alive, we met our guide, Evgeniy Brylkinm, a twenty-something from the Urals who’d pitched up in Barentsburg a few months earlier in search of adventure and now looked as if he wished he hadn’t. Brylkinm took us on the tour, past the kindergarten, on its walls a giant mural featuring the Kremlin and St Basil’s Cathedral, a Russian consulate*, the world’s second-most northerly brewery, a brutalist monument to Soviet miners*, an Orthodox chapel* and a statue of Comrade Lenin. “Our hero,” said Brylkinm. (There is another Russian settlement further north, Pyramiden, abandoned in 1998, with a Lenin statue*.)
Brylkinm told us that there are 350 miners in Barentsburg, down from 1,300 in the Soviet heyday, many of them Ukrainians. “On Soviet Army Day 10 years ago, there was big fight; knives, smashed faces,” Brylkinm said.
After a lunch of borscht and pickles and solyanka (pork stew) in the Barentsburg Hotel, we visited the gift shop, where we perused the Lenin caps and packs of old roubles wrapped in cellophane. Even now, I can’t help thinking I might have imagined Barentsburg.
The next afternoon, kitted out with snowshoes, we headed for the glacier behind Longyearbyen. At the city limits, Signe Dahlberg, 25, and Karl Schönning, 32, our guides, stopped to load their rifles (live rounds are not allowed in town), and then we were off, climbing steeply, the only sounds our snowshoes crunching into the soft snow and our heavy breathing. After three hours in the dark, we arrived at our accommodation: a snowcave, about six metres across. As Karl cooked up a lamb stew, Signe told us a little more about Svalbard (from the Norse “cold rim”), how of its 62,500 sq km land mass, 60 per cent is sheathed in glacial ice, 30 per cent is barren ground (scree, rock, moraines) and only 10 per cent is vegetated. Its seven national parks and 23 nature reserves now cover two-thirds of the islands. She told us how a 2015 ban on cruise ships using heavy marine oil — similar to the one enforced in Antarctica in 2011 — means that only small expedition ships can now access the remote parts (where the bears live). Svalbard, she said, is now one of the most well-protected ecosystems on earth.
After dinner, we got into our down bags and, in the tight circular space, arranged ourselves like spokes on a wheel, plumes of frozen breath rising, nobody daring to go outside for fear of becoming the world’s northernmost toilet-related polar-bear incident.
In the morning, we clambered down a ladder in a hole in the corner of the cave, and then walked along narrow, twisting corridors of 1,000-year-old ice, corkscrewing down inside the glacier. This was a meltwater channel through which, come the thaw, millions of gallons of water would rage. Above our heads, huge paving-slabs of rock dangled precariously from the ice. Signe showed us how the ice is layered, like the rings of a tree, so that you can tell its age. Tiny blobs of air bubbles trapped in the pellucid walls looked like strings of pearls. Down and down we walked, squeezing along the narrow tube, until we were deep inside the glacier. Signe asked us to turn off our headtorches. For a minute we stood in Stygian silence, utterly lost to the world.
On my last day, I went to visit Mine No 3, a working mine until 1996, but now open to tourists. My guide, Kristen Jaeger Wexsahl, 25, showed me around the former pithead, where ID cards, overalls and newspapers from the day it closed lay around, as if the miners were just on a tea break. I asked her what it was like to live here, especially through the winters. “People really like the mørketid [dark time],” she said. “It is so dark and cold that nature forces you to stop. You effectively hibernate. No matter how much we try and impose ourselves on nature, our bodies are more or less Stone Age. Living in Svalbard puts you back in your rightful place in the animal kingdom.”
Back outside, we looked out over Adventfjorden to Isfjorden beyond. “This is the first winter ever that there’s been no sea ice in the outer fiords,” Wexsahl said, referring to the year’s record high sea temperatures.
As we drove back to town, we passed a giant concrete door in the side of the mountain. “What’s that?” I asked. “The Global Seed Vault,” Wexsahl replied. “Since 2008, scientists have been depositing seeds here from the world’s most important crops. If a disaster happens, it would be like a Noah’s Ark, a way to rebuild.”
It seemed ironic that Svalbard, plundered for so long, struggling to survive against the climactic odds, could yet hold salvation for the rest of us.
Cutting-edge architecture at Europe’s furthest fringe
A remote fishing village in Norway’s Lofoten Islands is to be the unlikely site for a spectacular new luxury hotel. The Lofoten Opera hotel (pictured above, as an artist’s impression) has been designed by Snøhetta, an architectural practice known for the Alexandria Library in Egypt, the Norwegian National Opera house in Oslo and the entry pavilion at the 9/11 memorial in New York. Groundwork is nearing completion and the hotel is due to open within three years. It will sit on a rocky promontory just outside Sørvågen, a fishing community with fewer than 500 residents, close to where the road runs out at the far western end of the Lofoten chain. Despite its isolation, the property will have a spa, swimming pool and restaurant, with between 40 and 65 rooms. Dag Møller, the Oslo financier behind the project, says he was responding to a need for jobs in the area, and a lack of upmarket accommodation for visitors eager to see the Northern Lights, as well as to hike, ski, fish and kayak.

forbes,https://www.forbes.com/sites/nishandegnarain/2020/12/04/un-agency-accused-of-risking-arctic-pollution-with-greenwash-oil-ban/ https://www.forbes.com/sites/melaniewindridge/2021/01/27/sustainable-fabrics-reducing-the-impact-of-microplastics-on-the-planet/ ,"The embattled UN-affiliated agency responsible for global shipping (London-based International Maritime Organization) has been under attack from environmental NGOs who have accused it of greenwashing an oil ban in the Arctic.
The ‘ban’ on ships using heavy fuel oil was announced at the IMO’s Annual Environmental Meeting in November.
However, environmental groups have said this ban would only affect 25% of ships. 75% of ships travelling through the Arctic will still be powered using heavy fuel oil, one of the most toxic forms of fuels on the planet, and posing significant risks to the pristine Arctic environment.
Not only would the ban affect a small number of vessels, but it would only come into force nine years from now in 2029.
The Arctic is currently experiencing one of the warmest periods in its history, with exceptionally low levels of sea ice cover for this time of year.
Reduced sea ice cover allows more vessels to travel through the Arctic, reducing journey times from Asia to Europe by one third (35 days to 25 days) than going through the Suez Canal. By 2050, it may be possible for non-specialized ships to regularly transit over the North Pole, increasing risks to this region.
The use of heavy fuel oil is a double-death knell for Arctic communities, by both accelerating the impact of climate change and increasing the risk of a massive heavy fuel oil spill, as experienced by Mauritius in August.
The shortcut across the North Pole
Assistant Professor at the University of Hong Kong, Mia Bennett has looked at the impact of receding ice on future shipping routes.
Her assessments, posted on Cryopolitics, imply that by mid-century, vessels may be travelling directly over the North Pole, taking the passage she describes as the Transpolar Passage.
The risk of an Arctic oil spill
Arctic nations have been calling on tighter regulations for ships using the Northern passage to cut journey times.
The Arctic passages poses three particular risks for the three and a half week journey through the ice and freezing conditions:
- There are more hazards along the Arctic passage, with rapidly changing sea ice situations from icebergs and closing ice packs posing particular dangers. This is in addition to the higher risks of engine failure posed by the colder temperatures.
- Many vessels hulls are not fully designed to withstand the impact of closing ice sheets on a grounded vessel as was seen in Mauritius with the hull rupturing after 12 days stuck on the reef).
- An oil spill in the Arctic would be particularly toxic, as colder waters will keep the chemicals used for ship fuels (especially Heavy Fuel Oil or HFO) trapped for longer, and would have a devastating impact on the pristine wildlife and nature in that region for many years.
As was seen with the Mauritius oil spill, loopholes in shipping regulations means that many shipping companies can escape responsibility for cleaning up such oil spills by chartering vessels from riskier third parties, as Japanese operator MOL had done with the Wakashio.
The ‘Greenwash’ Arctic oil ban
A coalition of 21 leading environmental organizations, called the Clean Arctic Alliance, have slammed the decision by country delegates of the International Maritime Organization late last month.
The Clean Arctic Alliance have highlighted the inclusion of loopholes - in the form of exemptions and waivers - in the ban as ‘outrageous’ as they mean a ship Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO) ban would not come into effect until mid-2029.
The coalition are calling for waivers to not be granted by Arctic coastal states and for the deadline beyond which exemptions would not apply to be brought forward.
Lead Advisor to the Clean Arctic Alliance, Dr Sian Prior said, “By taking the decision to storm ahead with the approval of this outrageous ban, the IMO and its member states must take collective responsibility for failing to put in place true protection of the Arctic, Indigenous communities and wildlife from the threat of heavy fuel oil. In its current form, the ban will achieve only a minimal reduction in Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO) use and carriage by ships in the Arctic in mid-2024, when it comes into effect. It is now crucial that Arctic coastal states do not resort to issuing waivers to their flagged vessels”.
Heavy fuel oil is a dirty and polluting fossil fuel that powers shipping throughout the world’s oceans – accounting for 80% of marine fuel used worldwide. Around 80% of marine fuel currently carried in the Arctic is HFO, with over half by vessels flagged to non-Arctic states – countries that have little if any connection to the Arctic.
With most global shipping linked to six flags of convenience nations that have lower ship inspection standards, this poses particular risks for global shipping.
Three quarters of vessels will be unaffected by ban
According to recent analysis by the International Council on Clean Transportation, the regulation approved by the IMO will only reduce the use of HFO by 16% and the carriage of HFO as fuel by 30% when it takes effect in July 2024, and will allow 74% of Arctic shipping to continue with business as usual.
The analysis found that between July 2024 and July 2029, when the ban becomes fully effective, the amount of HFO used and carried in the Arctic is likely to increase as shipping in the Arctic increases, and as newer ships replace older vessels and are able to take advantage of the exemption or change flag and seek a waiver from the ban.
Already banned in Antarctic waters, if HFO is spilled in cold polar waters, it breaks down slowly, proving almost impossible to clean up. A HFO spill would have long-term devastating effects on Arctic Indigenous communities, livelihoods and the marine ecosystems they depend upon.
HFO is also a greater source of harmful emissions of air pollutants, such as sulphur oxide, and particulate matter, including black carbon, than alternative fuels such as distillate fuel and liquefied natural gas (LNG).
Wide variety of wildlife at risk
Verner Wilson III, Senior Oceans Campaigner at Friends of the Earth US, a Siberian Yup’ik Inuit from Alaska, is particularly concerned about the impact of a Heavy Fuel Oil spill on wildlife and indigenous communities’ subsistence ways of life.
“A HFO spill in our Arctic waters, where our people have survived and depended on for thousands of years, would devastate our subsistence way of life. The sensitive marine wildlife we depend on for food, such as seals, whales, walrus, fish and birds, would be devastated. We have a major concern that the use of waivers will create a risk of transboundary HFO pollution in the Bering Straits region where my family lives between Russia and Alaska USA.”
Ocean Conservancy’s Arctic Program manager, Sarah Bobbe is particularly concerned about how the weak regulations could lead to major devastation from a Heavy Fuel Oil spill.
“Instead of an effective and ambitious ban on use of heavy fuel oil in Arctic waters, the IMO has committed Arctic shipping to a course of action that may lead to a devastating spill of the world’s dirtiest fuels. The IMO’s lackluster decision is beyond belief considering it has already been ten years since the Arctic Council identified an oil spill as the biggest threat from ships, with heavy fuel oil by far the most detrimental, to Arctic waters.”
Countries may explore bans in national waters
Dr Sian Prior is now calling for Arctic nations like Norway to ban Heavy Fuel Oil from their waters.
Norway
“The Clean Arctic Alliance urges IMO Member States to seriously consider how the ban can be strengthened ahead of formal adoption next year, and for individual states to examine domestic options for providing the protection required for the Arctic from the risks of HFO use and carriage, such as Norway’s recent proposal to ban HFO from the waters around Svalbard.”
“It is important to recognize that issuing waivers to ships to exempt them from the requirements of the ban is not mandatory, the central Arctic coastal states have a choice. But if waivers are issued there should be full transparency and reporting,” said Danielle Fest Grabiel, Wildlife Team Lead, U.S. office of the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA). “We urge the five central coastal Arctic states to choose not to issue waivers in order to ensure that the use and carriage of HFO in the Arctic ends by 2024.""
Iceland
Chair of the Iceland Nature Conservation Association (INCA), Árni Finnsson, has called for the Government of Iceland to also step up.
“The Government of Iceland should take note of the leadership demonstrated by Norway in its proposal to ban heavy fuel oil from the waters around Svalbard by putting forward a plan for similar protection in Iceland’s waters. Arctic nations are facing unprecedented changes in the marine environment. There is not much time to act and Iceland must forge ahead with a total ban on HFO within Icelandic waters, and along with other Nordic countries must take a strong stand within the IMO to speed up the adoption and entry into force of a ban on HFO in Arctic waters.”
Higher port fees as a partial solution
Senior adviser at Green Transition Denmark, Kare Press-Kristensen, is calling for higher port fees.
Denmark
“Grøn Omstilling (Green Transition Denmark) recommends Denmark and Greenland to introduce high port fees for ships using HFO in Arctic waters, thereby motivating companies to use the less polluting distillate fuel, which will better protect the Arctic population and unique ecosystems against global warming, air pollution, and catastrophic oil spills.”
“This is yet another sad day for the Arctic”, said Sigurd Enge, Manager Shipping, Marine and Arctic Issues, of environmental organization, Bellona. “The Arctic environment is threatened from all sides, from climate change, toxic contamination, plastic pollution, oil exploration and other extractive industries.
What the Arctic needs now is better protection and bold politicians. There are no technological barriers, no shortage of alternatives to heavy fuel oil, and the shipping industry needs in any case must switch from fossil fuels to fulfill the IMO’s own Greenhouse gas - strategy and Arctic waters are the place to start. The Norwegian government’s proposal to ban HFO in waters around Svalbard proves that this is feasible. The coming decade is crucial to the future health of the arctic environment and the IMO’s decision today is just not acceptable.”
A move toward regional shipping regulations
The failure of the IMO to set strong international regulations to protect the environment is forcing many countries to explore regional solutions as an alternative to the ‘greenwashed oil ban.’
“The IMO’s decision to approve this weak HFO ban will force us to find other ways to protect the Arctic”, said Alexey Knizhnikov, Responsible Industry Programme Leader at WWF Russia.
Russia
“In Russia, this kind of action is needed even more than in other Arctic regions, due to the huge increase in shipping traffic expected to occur in upcoming decades, and this year’s massive oil spill on Taymyr has highlighted the cost to nature of using oil-based fuels in the Arctic. There is a little room for optimism - in October 2020, Russia’s new national Arctic strategy was adopted, which priorities the switch from oil based fuels to alternatives in the Russian Arctic”.
Under the new regulations, five central Arctic coastal States - Russia, Norway, Denmark (Greenland), Canada and the United States - will have the option of issuing waivers to their own flagged ships while they are operating in their own waters.
Canada
“All Arctic states need to eliminate the use of HFO by 2024 to ensure an HFO ban fulfils its original intent. The food security and livelihoods of local and Indigenous communities is dependent upon the success of this ban to protect them from pollution and spills. Any benefits of the IMO decision today will be cancelled out by projected increases in shipping, leaving Indigenous and local communities facing larger risks and impacts in the future,’ said Andrew Dumbrille, Senior Sustainable Shipping Specialist at WWF Canada.
“The Arctic Council should build on the example of Norway's proposal for Svalbard, assert its Arctic stewardship role, and scale up the ambition of the IMO ban within the jurisdictions of Arctic countries, without waivers and exemptions. Such commitment should be reflected in the Ministerial Declaration concluding the Icelandic chairmanship in May 2021”, said Peter Winsor, director of WWF’s Arctic Programme.
IMO failing to control greenhouse gas emissions
The decision on Heavy Fuel Oils in the Arctic comes on the back of the IMO failing to restrict greenhouse gas emissions from shipping.
In a decision at the same Japan-chaired Environment Meeting in November, the IMO voted to approve regulations that would see emissions rise by almost 15% compared with the global need to reduce emissions by 40% to meet Paris Climate Agreement goals.
With the IMO and the shipping industry continuing to breach international scientific advice, there are question whether the organization is still fit for purpose.
With the United States being an Arctic nation and influential member of the IMO, it will be interesting to see what steps the new Biden Administration could call for to reign in global shipping. . Plastic is everywhere. Ever since mass production of plastics spiked in 1950 it has only been rising, and now it is in everything around us. At this very moment, you are probably surrounded by more items made out of PET, PEHD, PVC and other plastic materials than you realise.
Although we are aware of how severe an issue plastic waste is globally, we have only recently become aware of how pervasive plastic can be when it breaks down. Plastics have just been found in human placentas for the first time and there is still more to find out about whether small particles of plastic, called microplastics or nanoplastics, could be dangerous to human health.
This month New Scientist reported that Microplastics found across the Arctic may be fibres from laundry, stating that “polyester fibres make up nearly three-quarters of microplastic pollution in the Arctic.”
Fortunately, manufacturers are working on ways to reduce the shedding of fibres from clothing. Outdoor brand Polartec has developed a high-performance fabric that sheds 5 times less than ordinary fleece, and late last year they collaborated with sustainable Swedish sportswear brand Houdini to release the open-source Project Mono Air to share their fabric innovations with the world.
But first, let’s find out a bit more about microplastics in clothing.
Microplastics - what are they?
Microplastics are traces of plastic waste in the micrometre range (1/1000th of a millimetre to 1mm), though sometimes they are defined as being anything up to 5mm in size. Nanoplastics are even smaller—under 100 nm in size.
No Social Distancing In Space. Why Some Astronauts Are Sleeping In The Gym, Airlock And On ‘Camp Beds’ This Week
Every material sheds small particles into the environment and, unsurprisingly, microplastics have been found almost everywhere. They’re in the oceans, in marine animals that mistake it for food, in our drinking water, in the seafood we consume, in the salt we use, and even in the air. At this point, there is nowhere on Earth where you won’t find traces of plastic, and we are only at the start of beginning to understand what the long-term effects of them could be.
How does clothing shed microplastics?
What might not be obvious, is that our clothing also sheds microfibres, which is a type of microplastics. These mostly come from the materials used to make clothing, and it’s not just the synthetic ones that shed potentially harmful substances. Every type of material creates debris—from the start of its production until it reaches the consumer, and throughout its lifetime while in use.
For clothing in particular, due to the continuous washing required to maintain it, debris keeps shedding in our washing machines and travels into sewage. Since we are still unable to effectively filter out all particles of plastic in the water, microfibres circulate throughout the water systems and inevitably end up in the environment.
Can microfibre shedding be reduced?
I’ve discussed some of the effects the clothing industry has on the environment in a previous article. In summary, fast fashion contributes to a long list of environmental issues. The global fast fashion market in 2019 was valued at 36 billion U.S. dollars, and is expected to grow further over the next few years after recovering from Covid-related losses in 2020.
The problem with “fast fashion” and the increased turnaround of clothing goes beyond just large production numbers. The way fabrics are processed, the materials used and the life-cycle of an item all play a role in the amount of microplastic byproducts a garment produces. So it’s not just reducing demand and consumption that matters. Innovation and new production technologies play a crucial role in reducing the industry’s impact on the Earth.
One of the forerunners in sustainable material innovation is outdoor brand Polartec. They first started using recycled plastic bottles in their products back in 1993 and have since saved over 1.7 billion PET bottles from landfill. The brand produces nearly 5.5 million meters of sustainably made fabrics each year.
In 2018, Polartec developed their Power Air technology, which reduces the number of microfibers shed during the washing process. The idea started as a quest for what they described as “fuzzy bubble wrap”, because air is insulating and keeps us warm. But then it was reimagined by placing the “fuzz” on the inside to achieve a radical improvement in the environmental performance of the fabric. The fuzz is what helps keep us warm, but it is also what sheds the most.
David Karstad, VP Marketing & Creative Director at Polartec, said: “By encasing the lofted, heat-holding fibers inside more tightly knit, smooth-facing and backing knits, Power Air is able to preserve warming characteristics, while also reducing shedding over 5 times less than the rate of a standard fleece.”
The technology relies on encapsulating puffed-up, air-trapping fibres within a multilayer fabric construction, which not only improves the fabric’s performance in providing excellent insulation, but has also been scientifically proven to reduce fibre-shedding up to 5 times.
Technological advances are bringing new capabilities. The development of the Power Air fabric was primarily made possible by new, precise machines and fibre composition, as well as collaboration with experienced engineers. This work is fabric construction— engineering materials by placing individual fibres where they can do the most good.
Additionally, according to Karstad: “Although the knit pods look quilted, part of Power Air’s durability comes from the fact that it is actually a single piece of fabric made from a continuous construction: a bi-component knit that achieves tight, smooth faces and lofted insulators all in a single motion.”
Sharing the technology
On 7 October 2020, Swedish brand Houdini, released Project Mono Air in collaboration with Polartec. The first product to come out of the collaboration is Houdi, a garment made from over 70% recycled PET and constructed from a single form of polyester. This makes it possible for the fabric to not just be recycled, but to be broken down to its elemental form and repurposed into new yarn, and therefore – new products.
Project Mono Air built on Polartec’s existing Power Air technology to improve the fabric and make it even lighter. But what is so special about the project is that Houdini are committed to keeping Project Mono Air as an open-source campaign, allowing anyone to access a complete run-down of the garment's creation – from stitching patterns to the technology behind the fabric. You can also find out about how every design decision was made and explore the principles of circular design at the heart of Houdini’s apparel.
Eva Karlsson, CEO at Houdini, said: “If we want to really change the industry for the better, we can’t keep our innovations and discoveries to ourselves. If we all share the problem, why not also share the solutions? One garment is not going to solve the problem, but we hope it can be one step on the way. Hopefully, we can make this initiative echo even beyond the textile industry.”
Jesper Danielsson, Head of Design and Innovation at Houdini, also added: “The biggest challenge for all brands working with circularity is to design products that are sustainable without compromising on durability and performance. This is what we have been able to solve with the Mono Air. The goal with the open-source project is not to create identical copies of the Mono Air, but to let the work behind it become useful in the development of new products. If this can lead to new circular breakthroughs in the fashion industry – be it in the hands of a basement designer or billion-dollar brand – we are on the right path.”
We are seeing a growing awareness of how severe an effect the disregard for sustainability in our economy has on the planet and our wellbeing. Innovation and new technologies will play a vital role in our move towards a truly circular economy. Brands like Polartec and Houdini, some of the pioneers in sustainable apparel, will have to become much more commonplace for us to be able to reach our environmental goals and recover from the damage we have done, and still are doing, to our planet. .

traveller,https://www.traveller.com.au/svalbard-norway--life-in-the-deepfreeze-gtlkzi https://www.traveller.com.au/svalbard-norway--life-in-the-deepfreeze-gtlkzi ,"Of all the things I'm allowed to do in the Arctic town of Longyearbyen, dying isn't one of them. ""The government simply won't allow it,"" says our guide Hella Liira.
Given that I'm on foot in polar bear country, I draw great comfort from this.
Flanked by armed polar bear guards, our group follows Hella across the tundra near Camp Barentsz, a tiny outpost 10 kilometres outside of Longyearbyen in the Advent Valley on Svalbard's Spitsbergen Island. Penned by muscular mountains, their charcoal flanks still painted with zebra stripes from last winter's snow, the flinty valley is a desolate study in black and white, the bright daubs of our wind jackets the only relief. Above, the sun pirouettes around the heavens, producing 24 hours of perpetual daylight.
""It's because of the permafrost,"" explains Hella, continuing her story as the boggy ground makes sucking noises at our boots. ""The corpses won't decompose, so they have to be shipped back to the mainland for burial."" The town's small graveyard stopped accepting newcomers in the 1950s, partly because it was feared that the cryogenically preserved bodies could still contained traces of the deadly Spanish flu virus that had killed seven miners back in 1918.
Marked by simple white crosses the old cemetery sits at the base of a steep hill, just out of town. Flanked by the skeletal remains of the long abandoned 2b mine and watched over by the icy fingers of a glacier, I doubt there is a more desolate place to be buried.
If dying is out of the question, so too is giving birth. ""You can't be born in Longyearbyen,"" says Hella. ""When a woman has three weeks left of her pregnancy, she must go back to the mainland to have her baby."" I ask Hella what happens if a baby is born prematurely. ""Paperwork,"" is her deadpan answer.
These quirky facts, and more, I learn during a tour of Longyearbyen, the world's northernmost permanent settlement and administrative centre of Svalbard, an archipelago of islands in the Arctic Ocean. It's the final port of call on our Land of the Ice Bears cruise aboard the 148-passenger National Geographic Explorer with Lindblad Expeditions.
Long considered ""no man's land"", Svalbard's archipelago of islands is so remote (74° to 82° north latitude) that no Indigenous people have ever settled here. To put this into perspective, Churchill in Canada, the other place renowned for seeing polar bears is at 59°N, about the same as Edinburgh in Scotland.
Discovered in 1596 by Dutch explorer William Barentsz it wasn't until 1920 that Norway was granted sovereign control over Svalbard through the Spitsbergen Treaty, a treaty with an unusual clause granting 42 other signatories access to the territory.
The result is a multicultural town, with hundreds of Russians, Chileans, Filipino and Thais living and working here. With the future of Svalbard's mining industry uncertain (due to a downtown in coal prices and environmental conflicts) the town is turning to tourism. Tucking into an authentic hot and sour soup at the Taste of Thai restaurant, on a scrap of ice halfway between Norway and the North Pole, is about as off-kilter as it gets. There's also a brewery (polar beer anyone?), a cafe selling homemade chocolates, a sushi bar, a hotel serving Russian meals and a coal-mining-inspired restaurant in a former mess hall.
And then there's the Doomsday Vault. While permafrost isn't good for burial, it is excellent for preserving plant samples, a fact that has been put to good use with the establishment of the Svalbard Global Seed Vault, a back-up plan against the possibility of a global disaster.
Shrouded in secrecy, we are only permitted to look from a distance, the severe lines of the concrete tomb poking out from the mountainside like some kind of Bond villain's lair. ""Syria is the first country to make a withdrawal,"" explains Hella, ""To help replenish and regenerate crops lost during the civil war."" Suddenly the vault doesn't seem so fanciful any more.
From Camp Barentsz, with a brief stop to cuddle a team of huskies, we drive back to town, passing docile reindeers and hillsides glazed with flowers. It's the muted colours of these summer tundra plants – moss, mustard, cinnamon and sage – that inspired an artist to select the paintwork for the town's timber houses, huddled like Lego blocks alongside the shifting glaciers.
The 2000 or so people living in Longyearbyen – mainly miners, students, polar scientists and those working in tourism – are a hardy lot; where four months of continual winter darkness is accepted as normal, the carrying of high-powered rifles (outside of settlements) is law, and school camps are really survival lessons in dealing with polar bears. Svalbard, together with the Russian-controlled archipelagos of Franz Josef Land and Novaya Zemlya, is home to about 3000 polar bears, hence the need for precaution.
However, scratch the brittle surface and a softer, creative side is revealed – from the annual jazz festival, held on the first weekend in February, to Galleri Svalbard, an art gallery housed in an abandoned supermarket featuring the works of polar painter Kare Tveter (1922-2012).
Documenting Svalbard's polar nights and midnight sun, Tveter produced works such as Arctic Dream, Morning over Glaciers and Svalbard Fantasy, each an interpretation of the Arctic's ever changing light. As much as I'm captivated by the mercurial glow of Tveter's artworks, it's the placement of a lone Grotrian-Steinweg piano, all coltish legs and black thoroughbred lines, which draws me in.
I'm told a long distance ice trekker showed up one day, gave an impromptu jazz concert on the piano, and then continued on his merry way.
This week another musician is in town, Ludovico Einaudi, a world-renowned Italian pianist and composer, who has just returned to Longyearbyen after giving the concert of his life. The only clue to Einaudi's solo performance is Greenpeace's ship Arctic Sunrise, which sits defiantly off shore in all her rainbow glory, nodding and heaving on the swell.
Having travelled from the Netherlands to Longyearbyen, Arctic Sunrise took Einaudi (and his baby grand) out to a floating platform in the middle of the ice so he could play Elegy for the Arctic, an original composition designed to raise awareness about climate change. His performance was designed to transform the voices of the 8 million people who lent their signatures to Greenpeace's Save the Arctic campaign into music.
After a week circumnavigating Svalbard – watching polar bears leaping between ice floes, kayaking alongside icebergs and chasing waterfalls along the Austfonna ice cap on Nordaustlandet – it's impossible not to feel the urgency to protect the Arctic. On-board lectures by Emeritus Fellow Andrew Clarke, a scientist who worked for the British Antarctic Survey for 40 years, painted a grim picture about global warming and how sea-ice is melting at an unprecedented rate. And without the sea ice, we'd lose the polar bears, which rely on the ice for hunting, resting, travelling and breeding.
When ice cover decreases polar bears become trapped on land for longer and this is when the trouble, for both humans and bears, begins. In April this year a hungry polar bear appeared in Longyearbyen, on the beach, not far from the centre of town. ""He had to be tranquillised, have his rudimentary tooth removed [to estimate age] and loaded into the governor's rescue helicopter for relocation,"" says Hella. ""Imagine how the pilot felt with a sleeping polar bear behind him.""
Later that afternoon I take to the skies on a charter flight back to Oslo, the sky flush with the ghostly glow I've grown to love. Flying low over snowy, meringue-pie peaks, the plane shifts and shakes from turbulence, a sensation that usually fills me with dread. But today I'm fearless; safe in the knowledge that dying in Svalbard isn't allowed. Imagine the paperwork.

See also: The five countries you will always want to go back to . Of all the things I'm allowed to do in the Arctic town of Longyearbyen, dying isn't one of them. ""The government simply won't allow it,"" says our guide Hella Liira.
Given that I'm on foot in polar bear country, I draw great comfort from this.
Flanked by armed polar bear guards, our group follows Hella across the tundra near Camp Barentsz, a tiny outpost 10 kilometres outside of Longyearbyen in the Advent Valley on Svalbard's Spitsbergen Island. Penned by muscular mountains, their charcoal flanks still painted with zebra stripes from last winter's snow, the flinty valley is a desolate study in black and white, the bright daubs of our wind jackets the only relief. Above, the sun pirouettes around the heavens, producing 24 hours of perpetual daylight.
""It's because of the permafrost,"" explains Hella, continuing her story as the boggy ground makes sucking noises at our boots. ""The corpses won't decompose, so they have to be shipped back to the mainland for burial."" The town's small graveyard stopped accepting newcomers in the 1950s, partly because it was feared that the cryogenically preserved bodies could still contained traces of the deadly Spanish flu virus that had killed seven miners back in 1918.
Marked by simple white crosses the old cemetery sits at the base of a steep hill, just out of town. Flanked by the skeletal remains of the long abandoned 2b mine and watched over by the icy fingers of a glacier, I doubt there is a more desolate place to be buried.

greendiary,https://greendiary.com/svalbard-global-seed-vault-why-is-it-so-important.html ,"Established on a remote island in the Arctic ocean, Svalbard Global Seed Vault is a facility that has the world’s largest collection of seeds. The purpose to store the seeds is to use them in case of any natural disaster or if any of the species are lost due to any global catastrophe. That’s why global seed bank is also dubbed as the doomsday vault and Noah’s Ark.
Location and construction
The vault is built at Spitsbergen, which is the biggest islands in Svalbard archipelago. This location was chosen by the government because of its cold conditions and frozen ground with a temperature lower than 3 to 4 degree Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit). Site construction began in 2006 and celebrated its opening with the first consignment of seeds on 26th February 2008. The first lot of 278 000 seed samples comprised mostly wheat and rice.
The facility that completed ten years now is managed by the Norwegian ministry of agriculture and food, the Crop Trust and the NordGen (Nordic Genetic Resource Centre). Norwegian government owns the most diverse collection of seeds across the globe, which is coordinated by Åsmund Asdal. It is not open for tourists or any visitors but you can take organized trips with a guide to see the entrance.
The storage area covering 1, 000 square meters has three halls with artificial cooling systems to maintain a temperature of minus 18 degree Celsius. All the three halls are 120 meters inside the mountain Platåberget. Such surroundings inside the global seed bank ensure reduced metabolic activity and the natural cold climate keep the seeds safe even if the cooling system fails. At this freezing temperature, seeds will never develop and their aging will be delayed.
The first portion of the vault is a man-made tunnel that is not watertight. It has seen water logging and warm climate in the last few years. But, the Norwegian government is going to spend 100 million Norwegian krone to make it watertight.
In addition to the favorable climate, the vault is an ideal location for long time seed storage because of a few other reasons:
a. Svalbard has a local airport, so one can fly there whenever required. So, it is a remote location but still accessible.
b. The global seed bank is near a well-established area, Longyearbyen that gives it a geological and political benefit. Longyearbyen is just a kilometer away from the Svalbard airport.
c. It is well above sea level. Even in the worst case scenario of sea level rise, it is protected from flooding.
d. Vault is constructed to withstand up to 10 seismic waves on Richter’s scale.
On the vault’s roof and top of the entrance, you will see the artwork by Dyveke Sanne, dubbed as ”Perpetual Repercussion”. Made with triangular acid safe steel pieces, it makes the global seed bank visible during the day as well as night.
Motive
The vulnerability of seed banks located across the globe was the main cause to establish a backup storage. That’s why Svalbard global seed bank was established, which stores seed samples from crop collecting gene banks across the world. It is now an insurance policy for our future generation who will not face any lack of food supply even if there will be any climatic changes or huge population growth. It can secure today’s crop seeds for centuries.
Necessity
More than 1700 seed banks are already storing different crop varieties, but many of them are vulnerable to natural disaster, wars and in fact avoidable scenarios like poor management and lack of funds. Small errors like a non-working freezer can ruin the entire seed collection, which will be irreversible just like the extinction of mammoths and saber-tooth tigers.
The Repository
The global seed bank is capable of storing 2.5 billion seeds including 500 seeds of each 4.5 million crop varieties. Every 500 seeds are packed in three-ply aluminum bags by the genes banks. Then a maximum of 400 bags is stored in different containers.
With contributions from more than 76 depository institutions, currently, the vault has 968, 557 samples. The samples originate from almost every part of the world. Whether it is maize, wheat, rice, cowpea or sorghum from Asia and Africa or eggplant, barley, lettuce or potato from South America and Europe, it has all the varieties.
The depository institutions or gene banks own the seeds. They can withdraw the seeds in case of an emergency. A recent example comes from war-affected Syria, first country to make the withdrawal, where access to the gene bank in Aleppo was impossible in 2015. The International Center for Agricultural Research (ICARDA) that is responsible to handle Aleppo gene bank took seeds from Svalbard that was here as a backup storage for Aleppo gene bank. Research center personals took the seeds to the gene banks at Morocco and Lebanon. Within two years, seeds were grown successfully and then transferred back to the Svalbard global seed bank.
On the tenth anniversary of the vault, 77,671 seeds were added. Due to the withdrawal of 92,430 seeds by ICARDA, the current sample count is 968,557, otherwise, it could have been more than one million, that is 1,060,987.
Monitoring
None of the seeds lives forever. Gene banks located across the world monitor the viability of stored seeds. Once the gene bank sees that any of the samples is losing viability, they multiply, regenerate new ones and replace the same at Svalbard vault. In other words, testing the seed’s viability is the responsibility of gene banks. A Black Box system ensures that only the depositor has the access to seeds stored by them. Apart from the depositor, no one else is allowed to access the seed samples.
The vault follows international laws before accepting seeds from any depositors. It only allows the storage if the seeds are grown in the depositor’s country or are shared under either the Multilateral System or Article 15 of the International Treaty. .

Hi, I’m Olivia! I come from Bend, Oregon and I’m a Geology major in the class of 2020. This semester I’m studying in the archipelago of Svalbard, Norway at the northernmost university in the world (located at 78° N, which is about 650 miles from the North Pole). My courses here are focused on Arctic Geology, and in my free time I’m doing lots of skiing!
As a Global Sustainability Fellow, I will be exploring the topic of modern food systems in polar conditions. By conventional standards, Svalbard is a pretty uninhabitable place for human populations, so I’m therefore curious if and how any amount food sustainability can exist in the high arctic areas such as this one. . Energy and Waste Management in Svalbard
Hi again! I’ve now been in Svalbard for a bit more than 3 months, so I’m just over halfway done with my time here. In the span of the last month there has been a major transition from no sun shining down in Longyearbyen, to now having sun during all hours. The weather is starting to get a bit warmer too, and we’ve had a nice string of completely blue-sky days. Life up North is pretty sweet! However, with all this good weather, it is important to mention that Longyearbyen is now on its 96th consecutive month of higher temperatures than the long-term averages. This points to the fact that our planet, and especially vulnerable places such as Svalbard, are undeniably feeling the effects of climate change.
Since starting this project, in which my main topic is food sustainability in the High Arctic, I’ve realized that any discussion about food here in Longyearbyen is incomplete without some background knowledge on Svalbard’s sustainability in general. Therefore, this blog post will mainly be a reflection of the information and insights I’ve gathered regarding energy and waste, with the goal of using these topics to better frame the picture of food sustainability in later posts.
First, we’ll start with energy. The whole reason why anyone settled on Svalbard is because of the coal mining that started in the early 1900s. The geology here makes Svalbard an especially good place for mining, because millions of years ago, the archipelago was located much closer to the equator than it is now. This means the the climate used to be warm, wet, and full of plant life. Over the course of Svalbard’s northward migration, that organic matter was buried deep into the earth and now makes up the coal deposits that are found today. In the mid-20th century, the coal industry here was quite productive, with four settlements actively mining. Now, only two of those settlements still have open mines, with the other two settlements being either completely shut down or in the process of shutting down. There are also some questions regarding how successful the mines were even in their peak, with many people believing the mines were more used as strategic political tools by Norway and Russia to have access to land claims on Svalbard.
Regardless, Mine 7 is the only mine in Longyearbyen that is still in operation. 40% of the coal that it produces is used in the local Power Station, which supplies all of Longyearbyen’s heat and electricity. The other 60% of the coal is shipped to Germany to make steel. This coal extraction, in combination with the total remoteness and extreme climate of Svalbard, leads to the staggering statistic that if Svalbard were a country, it would be well above the very top of the list for CO2 emissions per capita. Svalbard produces 64 tons of CO2 per capita, in comparison to the actual highest country, Qatar, which produced 44 tons per capita. Meanwhile, mainland Norway emits only 11 tons. Though the Svalbard CO2 statistic is partially inflated by the relatively small population and high baseline emissions of any settlement, that is still no justification for how absurd the fact of the matter is. This statistic brings up the moral problem in that despite the central focus on climate change research at UNIS (the university where I’m studying), if we wanted to make the biggest immediate impact, we wouldn’t be here at all.
However, there is some pretty exciting science being undertaken in an attempt to combat climate change. One of my professors is heavily invested in creating a CO2 storage site, in which the goal is to capture and store the Longyearbyen CO2 emissions in the ground. In theory, this process should be possible for up to 80% of the emissions, given the specific and relatively unique geology of Svalbard. However, the logistics of capturing the CO2 and finding the exact right place to pump it back into the ground, along with accounting for any possible negative repercussions of such an engineered system, have led to some uncertainties. Yet the question remains as to whether it is justifiable for people to live here, if they are in turn coming up with large-scale solutions to the problems. With an optimistic view, living on Svalbard while undertaking relevant research, might be a “one step back, two steps forwards” type of situation.
In then turning to the waste side of things, I’ve found that there is much less transparency than there is with the energy information of Svalbard. It is quite hard to figure out how much waste is produced and where it goes, which I think is largely due to the fact that UNIS has no active research invested in waste problems or solutions. This is in contrast to the topic of energy, which is central to many of the classroom teachings. What I have learned though, is that all organic and human waste is dumped into the sea, while most of the other trash and recycling is shipped to Sweden (where it is cheaper to dispose of than in Norway). There is currently no large-scale recycling or storing of any waste on Svalbard, though some people have proposed filling the now empty mines with garbage. I think the general consensus is that filling the mines is not a good solution, though it’s a new idea so there is work to be done on it regardless.
When looking at the energy and waste production on Svalbard, it is obvious that there are lots of environmental shortcomings that seem to be inherent with living so far north. At the same time though, there are many brains that are working hard to minimize the negative impacts of living here, which is totally exciting. On my next blog post, I’ll talk more about concrete steps that are being taken on Svalbard to create a more environmentally conscious community, specifically by way of a “circular economy” food system. Stay tuned!
(Also, as a slight digression, a friend here showed me a 2015 French documentary called Tomorrow (originally Demain in French), which showcases environmental initiatives and solutions around the world that are successfully making a difference. It’s an uplifting and inspiring film, and I highly recommend!!)
Anyways, that’s all for now. Thanks for reading!

Svalbard and Norway
Svalbard is part of the Kingdom of Norway, but not all laws that apply on the Norwegian mainland apply for Svalbard. For example, Svalbard is not part of the Schengen co-operation or the EEA Agreement, and there is a requirement that you must be able to support yourself if you are living on, or travelling to, Svalbard. However, the Nordic Convention on Social Security does apply on the archipelago in the north, but you should note that regulations may differ from those that apply on mainland Norway.
Regulations regarding entry to Svalbard
The Norwegian Immigration Act does not apply on Svalbard, but Svalbard has a particular status in international law through the Svalbard Treaty. This means that citizens of all countries that are signatories to the treaty have the same right of access to and residence on Svalbard. Svalbard is not part of the Schengen co-operation, and foreigners need neither a visa nor a work or residence permit to stay on Svalbard. However, a visa for the Schengen area is required when travelling via the Norwegian mainland.
Everyone travelling in and out of Svalbard must be able to prove their identity with a passport. Norwegian citizens may use the national ID card instead of a passport. In addition, a driving licence issued in Norway after 1998 or a Norwegian bank card may be used under a transition arrangement until 31.12.2021.
Moving to Svalbard
Everyone who wants to move to Svalbard must have accommodation and studies or work arranged before they move there.
People planning to live on Svalbard must register in the archipelago’s Population Register within 8 days of arrival. You should visit the tax office and report if:
You are moving to Svalbard and will be there for at least 6 months
You are moving within Svalbard and your period of residence will be/has been at least 6 months
You are moving from Svalbard
If you are registered as a resident on Svalbard, you have certain rights regarding hunting and fishing, firearms, alcohol cards and health services. Even if you are registered as a resident on Svalbard, you are not regarded as a resident of Norway, so it is important to check with your home country about your rights and obligations when you live on Svalbard.
Rights and obligations when living on Svalbard
If you are planning to live temporarily, or move to Svalbard, you should find out about the regulations that apply there.
One requirement is that you have sufficient resources to support yourself on Svalbard. The Governor of Svalbard (Sysselmannen), the Norwegian Government’s highest-ranking representative on the archipelago, has the right to reject people who do not meet the requirements. This applies to both Norwegian citizens and citizens of other countries.
The Norwegian Social Welfare Act does not apply on Svalbard, so residents are not entitled to financial support for living expenses or housing. Residents are therefore not entitled to practical assistance if they have special needs because of illness, disability or age.
In order to receive benefits from The Norwegian Labour and Welfare Administration (NAV) on Svalbard, you must be a member of the Norwegian National Insurance Scheme (folketrygden). If you work for a Norwegian employer on Svalbard, you are automatically a member of the Norwegian National Insurance Scheme, but the membership ceases one month after the work agreement ends. If you have any questions about entitlement to social security benefits on Svalbard, contact NAV in Norway or the social insurance authorities in your home country before travelling.
Foreign citizens admitted to hospital on Svalbard must be able to show their passports and a health insurance card. If you do not have a health insurance card, you must be insured or be able to pay for the hospital stay yourself.
Because the Norwegian Immigration Act does not apply on Svalbard, you cannot earn the right to residence permits for the Norwegian mainland, even if you have lived on Svalbard for several years.
Work and housing
You must obtain a job on Svalbard before travelling. Most housing on Svalbard is owned by employers, and accommodation is usually offered in combination with a job offer. This makes it difficult to find housing without having a job on Svalbard.
The Norwegian Labour and Welfare Administration, NAV, has a list of all public vacant positions in Norway.
Tax on Svalbard
Svalbard has its own tax legislation, so all tax collected is used in the archipelago. Tax rates are lower than on the Norwegian mainland. There two tax schemes. You can either be subject to ordinary tax liability as a resident or have limited tax liability.
Studying on Svalbard
Svalbard has its own university centre (UNIS), offering research-based education in the fields of Arctic biology, geology, geophysics and technology. UNIS is not an independent university, but a specialist institution for students who have already studied at another university in Norway or abroad. English is the official language at UNIS, where a number of courses are offered at bachelor’s, master’s and doctoral level.

baltictravelcompany,https://www.baltictravelcompany.com/svalbard/ ,"Hi Inga,
Thanks for your efforts in arranging the trip, I had a excellent time.
For a start I've never been on a plane with so many visibly excited adults when we landed! It's not often when you get off the plane that pretty much everyone is stood on the tarmac taking pictures already. The Coal Miner's Cabin was a comfy stay for the night, with a great breakfast in the morning and lunch (with time for a wander into Longyearbyen). The ""city tour"" was nice, particularly the Svalbard Museum, which was a great overview to the islands.
The boat being relatively small was good as you got to know a few people well during the trip which was nice. The food was really good for every meal. Being an older boat it had a nice classic feel, although it did mean it was a bit noisy. The first night was all travelling, so not the most restful, but after that we were stationary a couple of times at night, and you got used to the noise. My cabin was 'cosy' but as expected the only time I spent in there was to sleep, and the other facilities were good.
The organisation on board, the landings and the guides were fantastic. The guide we had was really friendly and informative, and made sure we safe. That we did see a Polar Bear was definitely down to their efforts - a tiny off white speck on the landscape is not something you'd notice unless you knew what you were looking for and really paying attention. We were also lucky enough to see a Blue Whale on our final leg back to Longyearbyen. All the landings were varied with little talks about ecology, history, geology etc.
I was really grateful to be one of the people getting the flight the next afternoon, rather than the one that meant you had to be off the boat at 1am! Instead I got a decent night sleep, and a chance for another wander round Longyearbyen, which is very different when there's not a massive cruise ship in port.
The flight back to Oslo was a bit odd with the stop at Tromso; where you have to get off, do passports, collect baggage, walk through customs, check in baggage and get back on the same plane!
The hotel in Oslo was great - nice room. And I did a nice walking tour around the main sights of Oslo.
Overall a fantastic trip. I've attached a few photos.
Thanks

theculturetrip,https://theculturetrip.com/europe/norway/articles/svalbard-the-northernmost-tourist-destination-on-earth/ ,"OUR ULTIMATE COVID BOOKING GUARANTEE. FIND OUT MORE
Imagine a place where months of endless darkness abruptly switch to months of endless light. Where there are no trees, just a green dusting of moss, but where brilliant flowers bloom in the summer. Where the greatest dangers facing you as a tourist are polar bears and arctic terns, rather than any threats from your fellow humans. The place you’re imagining is Svalbard – the northernmost permanently inhabited settlement on Earth.
Viking legends point to a possible discovery of the archipelago that we now call Svalbard in the 12th century, although the first substantiated claim is that Dutch explorer Willem Barentsz discovered it in 1596. Soon afterward, various nations began to use the island as a base for whale hunting, although very few people ever spent the winters there. Towards the end of the 19th century, coal mining operations began, and that would become the main industry of the 20th century. Now, there are only two mining companies that remain – a Norwegian one and a Russian one.
Svalbard is technically a part of Norway, but it’s an autonomous territory, so things run a little differently there. It’s a tax-free zone, so some things, like sports gear or alcohol, will be much cheaper in Svalbard than in Norway. While much of the coal mining that was once there is now gone, there are still a few colonies – and even an old Soviet one that the authorities are thinking of opening up as a tourist attraction. Tourism is definitely growing as an industry, so it’s possible to get flights on SAS, Norwegian Airlines, or Finnair – at least in the summer.
The de facto capital of Svalbard is Longyearbyen, a community of 1,800 that has all the trappings of a small town, from a hospital to schools to cultural and sports centers. They even have a weekly newspaper. Otherwise, the settlements are minimal and mostly consist of research stations where access is limited. Probably the most fascinating one to tourists will be Barentsburg, which was originally built by the Soviets. You can find the two northernmost statues of Lenin in the world plus a lot of beautiful typical socialist realism artwork.
You won’t find much in the way of plants – the climate isn’t kind to anything but a covering of moss and some summertime flowers. The fauna, however, is a real draw. Polar bears are some of the main inhabitants – in fact, if you want to leave one of the settlements, you have to carry a rifle in order to protect yourself from the bears. There is also a special variety of reindeer that is native to the archipelago, plus a sizable population of arctic foxes and a number of (mostly) migratory birds.
You may have heard of the Nordic countries being described as lands of extreme, but Svalbard is, of course, a step above that. It’s not the weather, which is kept fairly moderate (meaning, similar to the other Nordic countries) by the Gulf Stream winds. It’s the sun, which disappears for 84 days in the winter and then doesn’t leave for 99 days in the summer. That means that when October 26th rolls around in Longyearbyen, you’re not going to see the sun again until February 15th, and then it will come up on April 20th and stay in the sky until August 23rd.
In addition to those two Lenin statues mentioned above, Svalbard also hosts the northernmost church on Earth, which is affiliated with the Church of Norway. For the more science-minded types, one particular fascinating object is the Svalbard Global Seed Vault. It opened in 2008 and has space for up to 4.5 million seed samples, just in case natural disasters, wars, or global warming threaten to wipe out any of the world’s plants.
While you probably shouldn’t come expecting an excellent clubbing scene, you’re in for an amazing experience if you come interested in natural pleasures. The hiking trails are stunning, with glaciers, fjords, and all sorts of other scenery that you really can’t get anywhere else. You can go kayaking through fjords, snowmobiling pretty much year-round, walking in glacial caves, and even touring on dogsled safaris.
As the world’s northernmost tourist destinations, this is one of the places that has the most potential to be changed and damaged by global warming. We can’t predict how that will go and how it will affect the archipelago, but this is definitely one of the trips that you may want to move up towards the top of your list. Glaciers, for example, are receding all over the world, and they are some of the most impressive sights on Svalbard.
If by some miracle you can (and you want to) swing a trip during the darker months, the skies that await you will be some of the most amazing that you can imagine. Its proximity to the pole, of course, makes it very likely that you’ll see the Aurora Borealis, or the Northern Lights. When there’s a full moon, it’ll reflect on the snow and ice, creating an eerie sort of bright nighttime light. And perhaps best of all, with the lack of light pollution, the stars will be at their absolute finest – you’ll see constellations you never even knew existed and be wowed at the grandeur of it all.
All in all, even though you may not have heard of Svalbard before opening this article, it’s got to be one of the coolest potential spots to visit on Earth. Difficult to get to? Yes. Expensive? Yes. Potentially physically and mentally demanding? Absolutely yes. But if you can stomach those hurdles, then you’re in for an experience beyond anything you can get elsewhere.

oceanwide-expeditions,https://oceanwide-expeditions.com/the-arctic/spitsbergen https://oceanwide-expeditions.com/to-do/experiences/polar-bear-tour ,"“Spitsbergen” is Dutch - spits meaning “pointed” and bergen meaning “mountains.” It was so named in 1596 by Dutch Arctic explorer Willem Barentsz. It took some time for the name to catch on – English whalers would refer to the archipelago as Greenland until the late 1780s. The Norwegian name is Svalbard.
Touched by three seas – The Norwegian Sea, the Greenland Sea, and the Arctic Ocean – Spitsbergen is the largest and only permanently populated island of the Svalbard archipelago of northern Norway.
Its rugged mountains and rolling tundra offer plenty of opportunities for hiking and snowshoeing. Spitsbergen is by far the largest wilderness area of Europe and offers some of the finest scenery and wildlife experiences in the world.

About
Svalbard weather
Svalbard is located in the high Arctic and shares the Arctic’s designation as a technical desert when it comes to annual precipitation (or lack thereof). Particularly the eastern part of Svalbard sees relatively little precipitation annually. The west coast sees more precipitation in the form of rain and snow. Depending on when you take your Svalbard cruise you can expect temperatures to average anywhere from -14°C in the winter to 6°C in the summer.
Facts about Svalbard
- The name “Svalbard” is an old name (going back to at least the 1100s) meaning “cold coasts.”
- Longyearbyen, Svalbard’s only true town, was founded by an American in 1906. It has a little over 2000 inhabitants.
- Almost 65% of Svalbard is a protected nature reserve or a national park.
- Svalbard is the archipelago (chain of islands) off the north coast of Norway.
- Svalbard has the world’s third biggest ice sheet, coming behind only Antarctica and Greenland.
- Svalbard is made up of 4 main islands, and almost 150 smaller islands.
- Nobody gets buried on Svalbard. Because of the cold in the ground bodies generally fail to decompose, meaning that the graveyards would quickly get overrun. Therefore bodies are shipped to mainland Norway and buried there.
Travel to Svalbard
Travel to Svalbard and experience one of the Earth’s northernmost human inhabitations. Your Svalbard expedition cruise will take you to a beautifully stark landscape of glaciers and rugged snow-capped mountains. During your Svalbard holiday you’ll explore the preserved and protected history of the region, watch high Arctic wildlife on both land and at sea. Come during the late autumn/early winter months and your Svalbard cruise will be capped off by the great wonder of the Polar skies, the Northern Lights. For the polar bear enthusiasts special polar bear itineraries are arranged to offer the best polar bear experiences.
Polar bear video by Vedat Mihmat . Where to see polar bears
Seal’s dread, whale’s bane, ever-wandering one – all of these are names for the sometimes terrifying, often elusive, always majestic polar bear.
But where is the best place to see these amazing apex predators?
Svalbard, otherwise known as Spitsbergen, is among the top locations for spotting polar bears. In fact, polar bears are one of the primary reasons thousands of tourists embark on voyages to the Arctic, especially the Arctic archipelago of Svalbard.
Though nobody can guarantee you will spot a polar bear, there are a number of Svalbard cruises devoted almost exclusively to finding and viewing these magnificent animals.
Polar bear tour basics
Though polar bears can be found all over the circumpolar north, our polar bear tours focus on northern Spitsbergen, the largest island in the Svalbard island group.
But polar bears can be as dangerous as they are beautiful, so expedition guides armed with powerful rifles supervise all landings. Passengers are cautioned never to approach a polar bear, and sometimes landings are canceled if a polar bear is seen close to (or approaching) the landing site.
This is because polar bears are carnivorous hunters and can be aggressive if they feel threatened. Caution is paramount, as is understanding of our limitations. Nature calls the shots in the polar regions, and most polar bear tours only manage one or two sightings.
The lure of the polar bear tour
But if polar bear trips cannot ensure a sighting, why do so many people continue to book tickets? The reason, perhaps, lies in the reputation of the creature itself.
For many people, the polar bear is so linked to the Arctic that it functions virtually as a stand-in for the land itself: indomitable, exotic, deadly if not respected. Also, polar bears have fascinated and frightened humans since our earliest days.
The Saami and Laplanders would not dare speak the creature’s name, giving it a number of nicknames to avoid angering it. Inuit called polar bears “wandering ones,” Kets called them “grandfathers,” and their Latin name, Ursus maritimus, translates to “sea bear.”
In other words, polar bears have meant many different things to many different cultures. Not surprising, then, that polar bear tours continue to pack in the passengers.
What powers the polar bear
At the end of the day, however, polar bears are animals just like us – albeit at the top of the Arctic food chain. They sleep (around 20 hours a day), they mate (in the spring, like many animals), and they eat (a lot).
Indeed, eating and finding food are among their main occupations. Many pictures taken on polar bear tours capture them in the act of doing just that. If you’re still wondering where to see polar bears, start by following the food.
Polar bears prefer a diet of seals, though they are far from picky: Reindeer, musk oxen, crustaceans, caribou, walruses, birds, bird eggs, whale carcasses, plants, and even other polar bears will do. When they’re fortunate enough to catch a seal, they consume mainly the calorie-rich blubber and skin, leaving the red meat and its abundant protein to their cubs.
Polar bear range and ranges
To find enough food, polar bears spend much of their time roaming great distances. Hunting leads them all over the Arctic, though polar bears are thought to have preferred feeding areas called “home ranges.”
Changing conditions in their home range, however, often compel polar bears to travel hundreds of miles in search of better food choices. These journeys can take some time, as polar bears are not fond of keeping up a fast pace.
Though polar bears can be elusive, their wide-ranging hunts explain why they can be found all over the Arctic. Svalbard polar bear tours, however, offer the highest probability of a sighting due to their careful search of key polar bear ranges.
See the polar bear for yourself
Reading about where to see polar bears is one thing, but seeing one in person is another. And seeing a polar bear in the Arctic rather than a zoo is best of all.
A number of our Svalbard trips give you the possibility of spotting a polar bear.

seatrade-cruise,https://www.seatrade-cruise.com/news-headlines/sustainability-focus-svalbard-continues-grow-tourism ,"So heard more than 100 participants gathered at a conference in Longyearbyen, Svalbard, to discuss the future of tourism and how to develop sustainable tourism in a vulnerable Arctic environment.
'The potential for conflicts is large, but the conflict level is low,' according to Anders Anundsen, Norway's minister of industry and fisheries, who opened the conference.
Anundesen also stated the Norwegian government has a clear vision and policy for the further growth and development of tourism in Svalbard.
Svalbard Gov. Kjerstin Askholt expressed satisfaction with the good and responsible tourism industry in the archipelago, but also pointed to missed opportunities as well as reasons to be vigilant of the potential for increased negative impacts as tourism grows.
Tourism in Svalbard gained increasing attention after a major decline in Norwegian coal mining there. Approximately 60,000 tourists visited by airplane last year, and an additional 40,000 arrived by cruise ships. The objective for Longyearbyen is to double the number of tourism workers, which may involve tripling the number of tourists.
The conference showed a remarkable level of agreement about the need for sustainable development, and also acknowledged the unused potential for marketing national parks and the interesting cultural history.
The two-day event was organized in cooperation between the Association of Arctic Expedition Cruise Operators, Visit Svalbard, Svalbard Business Council and the University Centre in Svalbard, with funding from Svalbard Environmental Protection Fund.

We are all children of Christopher Columbus, after all, and our every unexpected and temporary landing is the dream of the Indies that we harbor in our hearts.
This was the case for the Arctic, also for the Svalbard Islands.
Getting to these islands that look like the Alps in the middle of the Arctic Circle is a blow to the heart. I can imagine William Barentz when, in the incredible undertaking of finding the Northeast Passage for the usual desired Indies, he found this sight in front of himself.
Also incredible, around three centuries later, it must have been the view of John Longyear, an American entrepreneur who, arrived in the freezing plain that now houses Longyearbyen, saw, through the sinuous curves of the mountains, routes of pure coal.
Colonialism.
Centuries ago colonialism was a dream: new lands, new hopes, new wealths.
Every land known by man in its long history has been the target, protagonist and victim of this colonialism.
Here in the Svalbard Islands it was whales first (with their fat capable of becoming good fuel) and then coal. Always trading goods, always sources of energy: it is easy for me to find some parallelism with today’s times.
Here, today, narrowing my eyes burnt by the freezing wind, history repeats itself: from ancient and modern colonialism to contemporary post colonialism that makes these lands a cooler Las Vegas without slot machines.
Today the Svalbard Islands are the place of contrasts and compromises, of appearances and cold reality. The town where everything or almost everything happens is a borderland without borders, a Klondike at the 78th parallel north, a No Man’s Land where man clings to consumerism as the only bulwark to feel alive.
Could tourism be the only sustenance of an island here in Winterfell?
How could a Paradise Lost like this sustain all these people, snowmobiles, cruise ships over time without destroying such a precarious balance?
From the eco-centric land spotted by Barentz we have come to the purest and most frightening self-centeredness. Have we always been so capable of ruining everything? Wasn’t this the island of dreams? Colonialism, we said.
Colonialism derives from the Latin colonus, farmer.
The settlers – coloni – were the people who in ancient times were sent to new lands to live and cultivate them – in fact.
The renaissance of this island today passes right here: from the farmers, from the coloni.
Who can be colonus in this inhospitable land, where nothing grows and where no man can be born or be buried? There are dreamers who do not need fertile lands to sow: it is the vision of a better – and more sustainable – world the best fertilizer.
On our trip we met Ben, American dreamer-cook-farmer here in Svalbard to realize his dream: to grow vegetables a stone’s throw from the North Pole and to create the first sustainable Arctic economy with zero impact.
We met Бsmund, a Viking divinity with a good heart who told us how here, inside the permafrost, the Svalbard Global Seed Vault is at the same time backup, gift, cathedral and a dream come true.
A gift for humanity of the present and the future.
We met Cheshtaa, Mirko and many young dreamers.
Yes, because this is the island of dreams. Dreams that can become nightmares if not pampered well.
This is their story. This is the story of the future of this treasure island.
The future of the Svalbard Islands passes from here: from dreamers like Ben, who will make his agricultural – indeed, post-agricultural – project flourishing and in a few years he will be able to grow microgreens and vegetables for the whole island, passes by Бsmund the viking, keeper in this permafrost of the collective memory of all the farmers of the world, and passes through all the visionaries like Cheshtaa and Mirko who, here to change the world, are starting to change themselves. .

infoq,https://www.infoq.com/news/2021/03/sustainable-internet/ ,"To be sustainable, the internet needs to assess, mitigate, and live up to its responsibilities for a healthy environment. By understanding the environmental impact, we can point to avenues where progress is possible and identify aspects of our digital infrastructures that come with unintended consequences that are too severe to look the other way.
Cathleen Berger, sustainability steward at Mozilla, gave a keynote on the sustainability of the internet at OOP 2021.
Sustainability is often defined as the interconnection of social connection, economic well-being, and a healthy environment. In trying to better understand how we may approximate the internet’s environmental impact, Berger looked at different research papers that estimate the impact of social media, online advertising, and online streaming, for example:
These studies all provide different levels of accuracy and often come with quite a vast span of estimated greenhouse gas emissions but, if we do add these calculations up, we get to somewhere between 0.5 and 1.9 GtCO2e per year – and this may still be a conservative assumption.
""By no means do I want to brush aside the many, many benefits that the internet provides,"" Berger said, ""but understanding its environmental impact is key to supporting the necessary sustainable transformation of our societies.""
Berger called on each stakeholder to do their part to reduce the environmental impact of the internet:
For business, this could mean: making environmental impact assessments a part of your core culture and understanding sustainability as a driver of innovation. This isn’t a far-off future investment, but a regular five-year strategy span, so ride that curve and incorporate risk assessments and innovation principles.
For governments, this means making transparent GHG reporting mandatory and ensuring that public investment only goes to technologies that are net-positive, including for future generations.
And civil society should double down on seeking and providing advice, demanding better, more, and faster when it comes to environmental protection.
For all of us, it has to be clear that this is a commitment, not a one-off, Berger reminded us.
InfoQ interviewed Cathleen Berger about the sustainability of the internet.
InfoQ: How would you define sustainability? How does this definition apply to the internet?
Cathleen Berger: I define sustainability as the interconnection of three elements: social connection, economic well-being, and a healthy environment. From that lens, this pandemic has no doubt reminded us that the internet is often a lifeline for social connection, certainly in times of physical distancing.
It is the primary means of conducting business for those of us who are not on the essential frontlines, allowing many people to work remotely, provide online services, and monetisation. Hence, the internet is a critical vehicle to safeguard economic well-being.
However, to be sustainable, the internet also needs to assess, mitigate, and live up to its responsibilities for a healthy environment – an element of the equation that is too often neglected.
InfoQ: What is the internet’s environmental impact?
Berger: In an ideal world we’d be able to calculate the internet’s impact by looking at infrastructure, the electricity required, devices used to access the web including desktop, laptop, tablet, phone, and other connected devices, as well as available content and other data flows.
Unfortunately, measuring all these elements reliably is not only really complex; there are also divergent opinions on what should be the underlying technical assumptions and boundary conditions. This currently leaves us with high-level statements, such as the European Commission’s ""Supporting the Green Transition"" paper, that stipulates that the impact of the Information and Communications Technology (ICT) sector amounts to around 2% of global emissions with the potential for this to grow to up to 14% until 2040, if no countermeasures are taken.
Even at 2% that would equal roughly 0.8 GtCO2e emissions per year – which by the way is about the same as Germany’s overall annual emissions in 2019.
InfoQ: What has been done already to reduce the impact of the internet on the environment, and how has that worked out?
Berger: We’ve seen many tech players, like Microsoft, Apple, or Amazon, and of course Mozilla, come out with ambitious pledges for carbon neutrality, net zero emissions, or becoming carbon negative. This is great. And there is still a lot of research and innovation to be unlocked.
To start, environmental impact assessments and reporting are not yet streamlined, and often still lack transparency around methodology and results across all scopes and categories of the GHG Protocol – which makes understanding and comparing progress and best practices difficult. The GHG Protocol is the most commonly used standard for environmental impact assessments that also provides guidance for how to account for different greenhouse gases, not just carbon dioxide (CO2).
In addition, there tends to be a focus on energy requirements and how to improve the efficiency of servers, data centers, and products in terms of how much power they require. While this is important and has slowed down the increase of emissions associated with the sector, it does not account for its impact on scarce resources, like available land, water, or rare earths materials, and it also doesn’t address concerns around recycling or disposal.
InfoQ: What steps can be taken to further reduce the impact?
Berger: The simple answer is: many. The good news is that while the scale of the challenge may seem absolutely overwhelming, digital technologies provide that same scale to solutions.
We’ll need change on all levels and aspects of our life and work -- which also means everyone is in a position to drive positive change, just start by reflecting on your usual workflow. People are often surprised at what comes up, when they allow themselves to question what’s ""always been done that way.""

For holiday destinations across the world, the environmental and social impact of tourism is huge. While the influx of tourists presents multiple opportunities for local value creation and employment, it also has negative impacts. These include increased pollution, damage to the landscape and disturbance to local communities.
“Sustainable Destination” certification is awarded to destinations in Norway that are working systematically to reduce the negative impact of tourism. In order to be certified, a destination must preserve local nature and culture, strengthen social values, demonstrate political commitment, have effective management, and be economically viable. Each of these five criteria has specific indicators that make it clear which actions are to be taken. Read more about sustainable tourism in Norway.
The “Master Plan – Destination Svalbard Towards 2025” created by the tourism industry and local politicians helps Longyearbyen to take appropriate, jointly funded steps to grow the destination.
A thematic plan for traffic and adventures outlines how Longyearbyen can be adapted to guests and residents to avoid wear and tear on nature and keep people safe.
There are hosting courses for service employees and a certification programme for guides. Guests should feel welcome and well taken care of, and receive adequate information about “dos and don’ts” in Svalbard nature. Employees should have a sense of pride, ownership and local identity.
Visitor surveys give the tourism industry valuable insight. Although the number of tourists is increasing, fresh results show that guests still perceive Svalbard as untouched and authentic, indicating that growth is being managed correctly.
Svalbard Cruise Network coordinates local activity related to summertime cruise ships and is encouraging ships to stay longer in Longyearbyen and spend a few extra days in the Isfjord to promote slower sailing and reduce fuel consumption.
Other initiatives include free loan of bikes and kick sleds, rubbish clean-ups, better waste management and promotion of locally produced goods. Visit Svalbard is environmentally certified, and other tourism companies are encouraged to follow suit. Companies that take sustainability seriously will be prioritised in various contexts.
Tourists are increasingly choosing tour operators that focus on sustainability. Tour operators can recommend any Norwegian destination certified as sustainable, secure in the knowledge that the destination is working continually to advance sustainability – economically, socially and environmentally – while providing an excellent experience.
The tourism industry in Longyearbyen is promoting the Northern Lights winter in Svalbard, as the Polar Night offers wonderful nature-based experiences. From November to January – currently low season – aircraft are half full and hotel capacity is under-utilised. Spreading guest traffic throughout the year will promote a healthier economy and more viable local community, with safe, year-round, full-time jobs.

Svalbard
Svalbard is an archipelago in the Arctic Ocean, located between 76° and 81° North. It lies directly north of North Cape on the Norwegian mainland. Spitsbergen is the largest island and occupies more than half of the area. Some of the other islands are Nordaustlandet, Edgeøya, Barentsøya, Prins Karls Forland, Kong Karls Land, Kvitøya/ White Island, and Bjørnøya/Bear Island. The total area is approximately 62,160 sqkm, roughly equivalent to the size of Ireland.
History
The name Svalbard is first mentioned in the Icelandic archives from the year 1194, ""Svalbardr fundr"" – Svalbard is found. It is uncertain, however, whether it was the land or the ice edge that had been discovered, since Svalbard can be interpreted as ""cold coast"" or ""cold edge"". It would take another several hundred years before any of the major nations in Europe discovered Svalbard. In 1596 two Dutch ships sailed north to round the tip of Norway, hoping to find a shortcut to China and India. On board one of the ships was the pilot Willem Barents, who is officially regarded as the discoverer of Svalbard. The Dutch were impressed by Svalbard's dramatic and mountainous landscape, and named the land Spitsbergen.
Svalbard soon became a natural starting point for several more or less successful attempts to reach the North Pole. Ice-free waters cannot be found this far north anywhere else on Earth. Nordenskiöld, Amundsen and Andrée are some well-known Arctic explorers who have attempted to reach the North Pole.
Wildlife and nature
To most visitors, Svalbard is a life changing experience. It is a truly magic world with midnight sun and pack ice, glittering glaciers and exceptional wildlife – not far from the North Pole. The exact number of polar bears is hard to measure since the bears move across huge areas. During an expedition cruise, however, there are great chances to encounter some of them. The ice plays a central role in the Arctic ecosystem, which is both unique and vulnerable. In many ways, the mammals are Svalbard’s very soul. Half of the 22 species of mammal that live on land and ice and in the sea around Svalbard are whales. Svalbard reindeer and Arctic fox are the only mammals that live entirely on land.
Svalbard has a rich bird life, particularly sea birds that nest in large colonies. More than 200 bird species have been observed in Svalbard and its surrounding waters, but only a few species nest here. Four species account for 95% of Svalbard’s abundant bird life: Brünnich’s guillemot, the northern fulmar, the little auk and the black-legged kittiwake. Nowhere else on earth do you find birds in such impressive numbers this far north.
Glaciers and pack ice
Svalbard is still in the ice age. Glaciers cover 60% of the land and the ice can be up to 600 metres thick. There are more than 2,100 glaciers in Svalbard. Some of the mightiest and most well known include Monacobreen, Lilliehöökbreen and Bråsvellbreen. Austfonna on Nordaustlandet in the northeast part of the archipelago is an ice cap that is one of the largest in the World. Its ice front reaching into the sea is more than 130 kilometres long.
Geology
Anyone who is interested in geology will find Svalbard very exciting. The archipelago was formed on the northeast coast of Greenland a long, long time ago, and has since moved via continental drift to the other side of the equator where it turned and headed north. Just wait another 50 million years, and Svalbard will probably be at the North Pole!
Plants
Svalbard is not exactly a hothouse, the fact is that plants can only live on some 7% of the land area. There are approximately 164 species of native plants growing on Svalbard, plus at least 6-7 species that were introduced by man.
Seasons in Svalbard
During the winter, the Svalbard archipelago is covered in ice and snow. The midnight sun shines brightly between mid-April until the end of August. The average temperature in July is +6°C.
Simply put, you can divide the year in Svalbard into two parts: The dark and the light season. In mid-February the first rays of the sun appear over the mountain peaks, and the midnight sun period in Longyearbyen is between 20 April and 22 August. The daylight completely disappears again in early November. The number of snowmobiles parked everywhere in Longyearbyen testify that the bare ground of the summer is only a brief interruption in an otherwise long winter landscape.
May and the beginning of June are characterised by a lot of snow and a wonderful purity. It is still spring in the Arctic. This year’s polar bear cubs are still small and sometimes can both bears and seals be seen on the fjord ice in front of the glaciers.
Summer arrives in late June. The ice thaws around the islands and this makes it possible to get further east. Whales are more frequently seen in the waters and more and more snow-free areas become accessible for longer walks. Colourful flowers are in bloom.
Autumn arrives in late August and it is now that the snow free landscape is most visible. The tundra is shifting in autumn colours and the midnight sun is getting closer and closer to the horizon, which offers wonderful red and pink skies at sunset, as well as a warm and soft light, perfect for anyone interested in photography. From mid-August you may be able to see the Ivory Gulls’ chicks, while some birds are preparing to migrate. Harp seals can be seen and female walruses with cubs are not an uncommon sight.
AECO
AECO – Association of Arctic Expedition Cruise Operators – was founded in 2003 and has since become an important organization representing the concerns and views of arctic expedition cruise operators. AECO is dedicated to managing responsible, environmentally friendly and safe tourism in the Arctic and strive to set the highest possible operating standards.
The association’s geographical range is considered to encompass the Arctic area north of 60 degrees north latitude. The core areas are Svalbard, Jan Mayen, Greenland, Arctic Canada and the national park “Russian Arctic”.

Established in 1999, PolarQuest is a world leading operator of small ship expedition cruises in Svalbard. Our three expedition ships, built for Arctic waters, take a maximum of 12 or 53 passengers. Such small ships offer an entirely different experience compared to a larger cruise ship. Just imagine – viewing a walrus on an ice floe in a group of 10 – 50 passengers, or to do so in a group of 250 – 500! Small ships can also reach some of the most remote areas and venture into narrow fjords. Sustainability is at the heart of what we do, and all our trips are 100 % climate compensated. More about us

Clean Seas - turn the tide on plastics
PolarQuest is one of the eight companies that founded the Association of Arctic Expeditions Cruise Operators (AECO) in 2003, to regulate tourism in Svalbard and promote sustainable, environmentally friendly and safe tourism in the area. The organization strives to conduct expeditions with the utmost respect for nature and wildlife. In 2017, AECO and its members were invited by the UNEP to partake in the project ”Clean Seas – turn the tide on plastic”. As part of the work to combat marine plastic pollution, AECO’s members will drastically cut back on single-use plastics on Arctic expedition cruise vessels. Read more
My favourite travel memory - Niklas Nilsson
Already as a child, Niklas Nilsson, travel consultant and photographer at PolarQuest, was dreaming of visiting Antarctica and its magnificent nature. At a travel show in Gothenburg, he came in contact with PolarQuest and shortly after he booked his most extraordinary adventure so far – an expedition cruise to the world's most remote and pristine continent with the ship Ocean Nova. Read his words about this unforgettable trip, and watch a short slideshow below. Read more . Svalbard (Spitsbergen)
Since 1999, we have taken adventurous travellers on once-in-a-lifetime trips to Svalbard. From May to September our three small expedition ships, carrying only 12 and 53 passengers, explore this magnificent Arctic archipelago. Unpredictability and flexibility are the main keywords when you travel through Svalbard’s untamed wilderness with PolarQuest as the exact route depends on weather, ice conditions and wildlife encounters. Sometimes you might be woken up in the middle of the bright night if a polar bear has been spotted on the ice. All trips are climate compensated.

Svalbard
Svalbard is an archipelago in the Arctic Ocean, located between 76° and 81° North. It lies directly north of North Cape on the Norwegian mainland. Spitsbergen is the largest island and occupies more than half of the area. Some of the other islands are Nordaustlandet, Edgeøya, Barentsøya, Prins Karls Forland, Kong Karls Land, Kvitøya/ White Island, and Bjørnøya/Bear Island. The total area is approximately 62,160 sqkm, roughly equivalent to the size of Ireland.
History
The name Svalbard is first mentioned in the Icelandic archives from the year 1194, ""Svalbardr fundr"" – Svalbard is found. It is uncertain, however, whether it was the land or the ice edge that had been discovered, since Svalbard can be interpreted as ""cold coast"" or ""cold edge"". It would take another several hundred years before any of the major nations in Europe discovered Svalbard. In 1596 two Dutch ships sailed north to round the tip of Norway, hoping to find a shortcut to China and India. On board one of the ships was the pilot Willem Barents, who is officially regarded as the discoverer of Svalbard. The Dutch were impressed by Svalbard's dramatic and mountainous landscape, and named the land Spitsbergen.
Svalbard soon became a natural starting point for several more or less successful attempts to reach the North Pole. Ice-free waters cannot be found this far north anywhere else on Earth. Nordenskiöld, Amundsen and Andrée are some well-known Arctic explorers who have attempted to reach the North Pole.
Wildlife and nature
To most visitors, Svalbard is a life changing experience. It is a truly magic world with midnight sun and pack ice, glittering glaciers and exceptional wildlife – not far from the North Pole. The exact number of polar bears is hard to measure since the bears move across huge areas. During an expedition cruise, however, there are great chances to encounter some of them. The ice plays a central role in the Arctic ecosystem, which is both unique and vulnerable. In many ways, the mammals are Svalbard’s very soul. Half of the 22 species of mammal that live on land and ice and in the sea around Svalbard are whales. Svalbard reindeer and Arctic fox are the only mammals that live entirely on land.
Svalbard has a rich bird life, particularly sea birds that nest in large colonies. More than 200 bird species have been observed in Svalbard and its surrounding waters, but only a few species nest here. Four species account for 95% of Svalbard’s abundant bird life: Brünnich’s guillemot, the northern fulmar, the little auk and the black-legged kittiwake. Nowhere else on earth do you find birds in such impressive numbers this far north.
Glaciers and pack ice
Svalbard is still in the ice age. Glaciers cover 60% of the land and the ice can be up to 600 metres thick. There are more than 2,100 glaciers in Svalbard. Some of the mightiest and most well known include Monacobreen, Lilliehöökbreen and Bråsvellbreen. Austfonna on Nordaustlandet in the northeast part of the archipelago is an ice cap that is one of the largest in the World. Its ice front reaching into the sea is more than 130 kilometres long.
Geology
Anyone who is interested in geology will find Svalbard very exciting. The archipelago was formed on the northeast coast of Greenland a long, long time ago, and has since moved via continental drift to the other side of the equator where it turned and headed north. Just wait another 50 million years, and Svalbard will probably be at the North Pole!
Plants
Svalbard is not exactly a hothouse, the fact is that plants can only live on some 7% of the land area. There are approximately 164 species of native plants growing on Svalbard, plus at least 6-7 species that were introduced by man.
Seasons in Svalbard
During the winter, the Svalbard archipelago is covered in ice and snow. The midnight sun shines brightly between mid-April until the end of August. The average temperature in July is +6°C.
Simply put, you can divide the year in Svalbard into two parts: The dark and the light season. In mid-February the first rays of the sun appear over the mountain peaks, and the midnight sun period in Longyearbyen is between 20 April and 22 August. The daylight completely disappears again in early November. The number of snowmobiles parked everywhere in Longyearbyen testify that the bare ground of the summer is only a brief interruption in an otherwise long winter landscape.
May and the beginning of June are characterised by a lot of snow and a wonderful purity. It is still spring in the Arctic. This year’s polar bear cubs are still small and sometimes can both bears and seals be seen on the fjord ice in front of the glaciers.
Summer arrives in late June. The ice thaws around the islands and this makes it possible to get further east. Whales are more frequently seen in the waters and more and more snow-free areas become accessible for longer walks. Colourful flowers are in bloom.
Autumn arrives in late August and it is now that the snow free landscape is most visible. The tundra is shifting in autumn colours and the midnight sun is getting closer and closer to the horizon, which offers wonderful red and pink skies at sunset, as well as a warm and soft light, perfect for anyone interested in photography. From mid-August you may be able to see the Ivory Gulls’ chicks, while some birds are preparing to migrate. Harp seals can be seen and female walruses with cubs are not an uncommon sight.
AECO
AECO – Association of Arctic Expedition Cruise Operators – was founded in 2003 and has since become an important organization representing the concerns and views of arctic expedition cruise operators. AECO is dedicated to managing responsible, environmentally friendly and safe tourism in the Arctic and strive to set the highest possible operating standards.
The association’s geographical range is considered to encompass the Arctic area north of 60 degrees north latitude. The core areas are Svalbard, Jan Mayen, Greenland, Arctic Canada and the national park “Russian Arctic”.

foodunfolded,https://www.foodunfolded.com/article/permaculture-in-svalbard-ethical-arctic-farming ,"Funded by the European Union
As the northern-most town in the world, Longyearbyen is the home to a little over 2000 inhabitants. To feed the transient workers that come and go with the seasons, as well as the more long-term locals, most of its food is imported and waste exported. Known for its harsh temperatures and strong winds, it’s nearly impossible to grow food locally in Svalbard—let alone sustainably.
But, it’s definitely possible. I traveled to the arctic to speak with Ben, the co-founder of Polar Permacultures, who incorporates sustainable practices and permaculture values when growing his microgreens and other vegetables in his Longyearbyen greenhouse dome.
Here’s what he had to say:
Jane (me): Hey Benjamin! Would you mind sharing a bit about yourself and Polar Permaculture Solutions?
Benjamin: My name is Benjamin L. Vidmar, and I am a chef/foodie from Florida, USA. I grew up in Cleveland, OH, a foodie city and was inspired by my two greatest foodie heroes: my grandmother and my mom. I graduated from Le Cordon Bleu culinary school in Pittsburgh, PA in 2001.
I traveled the world, and then moved to Longyearbyen, Svalbard in 2008. I started Polar Permaculture Solutions in 2015, which focuses on growing local food here in town and composting organic waste.

Jane: That must have been quite the change! How do you manage to grow food in the arctic? I imagine there’s a handful of challenges, especially with the harsh temperatures.
Benjamin: Protected climates are the only way around it. Even in nature, plants find microclimates that are protected from wind and then they grow there. And in permaculture, we observe and learn from nature. It is possible to create microclimates and grow food in conditions that many of us do not believe is possible.
In Longyearbyen, we sprout all our seeds in our indoor lab facilities using systems like LED lighting and aquaponics. Once they’ve sprouted, we move the plants to our greenhouse dome outside, where they can grow in the warmer seasons. In the winter, we keep all our greens (like microgreens) growing in the Lab.
Jane: So which of permaculture’s values inspire your work? values?
Benjamin: Permaculture is a design system that was inspired by how indigenous people were able to live on and with the earth for so long without causing damage like we do today. It is based on ethics and principles used to make the world a better place.
Permaculture is an umbrella term to describe the many principles and techniques that people use in order to be more sustainable. I must use different ways to grow here in Longyearbyen compared to how someone would grow in London, but it does not make it any less permaculture. It is more about a way of thinking and approaching problems.
I really appreciate the permaculture ethics: Earth care, People care, and Fair share of resources. People live in the arctic and permaculture is possible because of people.
Photo by Jane Alice Liu
Jane: Then what agricultural systems and innovations have you included that aligns with the mentality of permaculture?
Benjamin: We have bought many different growing systems, like LED lights, and products to help us grow as much food as possible. We also compost with red worms and have grown mushrooms in coffee grounds as well.
We also create some of our own fertilizer with composting worms. In the summer, we grow in our dome outside and there we try to use our worm castings that we create from composting organic waste we collect back from hotels and restaurants. We grow hydroponically indoors, and we use fertilizers that are designed for hydroponic systems. We don’t usually have problems with pest and if we do, we try to use non-chemical solutions.
We really work to be as zero waste as possible, but there are some things that we cannot avoid completely. Many of our trays and growing containers are made of plastic. I really don’t like single use plastics, but we get many uses out of our items. When it is finally not able to be used anymore, we send it to the garbage, and it is burned for energy. Our dome is also covered in a plastic film, and this came with the kit when we bought it. We are in the process of changing this cover out to a different material, but the challenge is that we only have temporary permission to be at our location, and there is not point in replacing the cover until we have a permanent home.
Jane: Wow! So then, what veg/fruit have you grown and can you grow?
Benjamin: I have grown tomatoes, cucumbers, potatoes, lettuce, herbs, leafy greens, microgreens, edible flowers, and mushrooms. I have not measured the nutrient content and cannot speak about the difference between conventionally grown crops, but I can say the items we grow taste great and they are not imported by plane or boat.
Photo by Jane Alice Liu
Jane: Is it possible to farm the whole year in the arctic?
Benjamin: Yes, because we grow indoors and also outside. We grow outside from around May until end of September.
Jane: But how does the presence or lack of sun affect your crops?
Benjamin: It is definitely important to provide a rest period for crops, and they can be stressed out by too much light. They also will not grow properly if there is too little light, so it is important to provide the right balance.
Jane: So, I guess that’s where the artificial lighting comes in. What powers your artificial lighting then?
Benjamin: At the moment, our energy is sourced from the local energy grid, which is currently fueled by coal mined here in Svalbard and supplementary diesel, but they are looking into other more renewable sources. As for our operations, in the future we’re looking into wind energy to power our facility.
Jane: That might be extremely helpful, given the strong winds that pass through Svalbard. What are some other challenges you face farming in the arctic (besides the lack of sun and freezing temperatures)?
Benjamin: The greatest challenge we face is lace of money and the extra cost of doing business here in Longyearbyen. Shipping cost are around 40% of the cost, so it is extremely expensive to do business here.
Jane: With climbing climate temperatures, we see glaciers melting and sea-level rising in the arctic. So, I’m wondering how has global warming affected how you farm in the arctic?
Benjamin: It is really hard to say, but the temperatures have been above expected averages for over 100 months here in Svalbard, and they say the temperature is warming faster than anywhere else on earth. It makes the city unstable and we need to evacuate certain areas of the town from potential avalanches. I can say it makes things unpredictable.
Hear more from Benjamin about how he grows his arctic vegetables in the FoodUnfolded podcast:
You can also download the FoodUnfolded Podcast on Apple Podcasts and Spotify.
Courtesy of Polar Permacultures
Jane: This one is a bit more personal, but how do you define sustainability?
Benjamin: I think it is important for companies to take responsibility for their waste and to stop focusing on profits and making tax payers clean up the company’s waste and environmental damage.
Jane: Are there any learnings we can apply from Polar Permaculture into agriculture in general? Do you think that permaculture can also be adopted by large-scale agriculture?
Benjamin: We work very small scale and we do all work by hand, but. our goal is to scale up production so that we can grow 10% of the needed leafy green vegetables here in town, but remember we have a population of around 2300 people.
In terms of large-scale agriculture, I think it’s important to mainly take responsibility and to have ethics. Money is only paper, and there are more important things to worry about than just earning as much paper as possible.
Jane: Can you give any tips to anyone who wants to start incorporating permaculture in their own gardens or farms at home or in their neighborhood?
Benjamin: Believe in yourself and follow your dreams. No matter how impossible it may seem.

Introduction
Wilsonart® Quartz surfaces are non-porous, formulated to stand up to the harshest environments and do not require sealing. They are highly resistant to bacteria, chemicals, stains, heat and moisture.
Cleaning
For everyday cleaning, simply wipe your Wilsonart Quartz countertop with a soft cloth, soap and water. A mild household cleaner such as Windex®, Green Works® or 409®are acceptable. After cleaning, wipe the surface completely dry to avoid streaks. Spills should be wiped up immediately.
Abrasive pads and powders can damage the finish of the surface. To avoid dulling the Wilsonart Quartz surface, use non-abrasive cleaners, pads and sponges. DO NOT USE: bleach, oven cleaners and abrasive pads or powders (i.e. Ajax®, Comet®, etc.).
Heat
Wilsonart Quartz is extremely heat resistant and can take temperature changes that most other surfaces cannot. However, all surfacing can be damaged by extreme temperature changes, both prolonged and sudden. Wilsonart recommends the use of trivets or hot pads when placing hot skillets, pans or other heat generating kitchenware on the surface. DO NOT place hot cookware directly on any Wilsonart Quartz surface.
Chemicals
Wilsonart Quartz surfaces are very stain resistant. However, we recommend avoiding high pH cleaning products as they can damage the sheen of the surface. If your surface happens to be exposed to any potentially damaging products, rinse with water immediately to mitigate the effects of any strong chemical or solvent.
Physical Abuse
Wilsonart Quartz surfaces are more durable than most surfaces available today. These surfaces are very resistant to cracks, scratches, impact and stains. But they are not scratch-proof so take care when using sharp objects near the countertop. Like any surface, excessive pressure on the surface with a sharp object can damage it. Cutting boards are always recommended when preparing food.
Performance
With proper care, your Wilsonart Quartz surfaces will look sleek and lustrous for the lifetime of your kitchen, bathroom or work environment. . ",False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False

borgenproject,https://borgenproject.org/poverty-in-svalbard/ ,"Svalbard, the Norwegian archipelago midway between Norway and the North Pole, is the northernmost settlement in the world with a civilian population. The archipelago has a population of 2,667, and while it is a territory of the Kingdom of Norway, its policies on poverty and social welfare contrast greatly with its mainland counterpart.
- Residents of the archipelago are required to have a job to reside there, essentially making poverty in Svalbard illegal. In addition, residents must have a fixed place of residence, making homelessness also illegal and ensuring that residents will not freeze to death. Residents without jobs are promptly deported to the Norwegian mainland, ensuring that the population remains able-bodied and sufficiently employed.
- Unlike its mainland counterpart of Norway, Svalbard has no social welfare system. The government does fund a school and a hospital, but provides no safety net of welfare for its residents, keeping with its policies regarding joblessness. This keeps taxes very low on the archipelago.
- While Svalbard has experienced a recent increase in crime, its overall crime rate has remained low. The archipelago stands as a microcosm of society, and while its methods are not necessarily universal, according to governor Odd Olsen Ingero, it does show a clear correlation between criminal activity and joblessness.
- The archipelago is home to the Svalbard Global Seed Vault, a vault designed as a fail-safe for over 1,700 genebanks worldwide. The vault currently stores over 880,000 samples of seeds in the permafrost at -18 degrees Celsius, guaranteeing that the samples will remain viable for hundreds of years.
Contributions from nations around the world work as insurance for genetic crop variations, providing a backup in case of natural or man-made catastrophes. The vault stands as a powerful defense against hunger worldwide and has most recently been used to aid a vulnerable gene bank in Aleppo during the Syrian civil war of 2015.
- Prices of fresh food on Svalbard sometimes border on extortionate. Its employed population and lack of social welfare help to keep taxes on the archipelago low, but high costs of transportation and extreme weather conditions make fresh foods such as vegetables and dairy extremely expensive. In 2014, Svalbardposten reported that a one-liter carton of milk could cost the equivalent of 7 U.S. dollars,
Poverty in Svalbard is practically nonexistent, but its economic policies and small population shed light on broader social issues. And while the archipelago’s economy is small and seemingly insignificant, it provides a fascinating microcosm of larger societies and a powerful platform for research. In addition, the archipelago’s Global Seed Vault has been and will continue to be a powerful weapon against poverty and hunger worldwide.

Svalbard is the Arctic North as you always dreamed it existed. This wondrous archipelago is a land of dramatic snow-drowned peaks and glaciers, of vast ice fields and forbidding icebergs, an elemental place where the seemingly endless Arctic night and the perpetual sunlight of summer carry a deeper kind of magic. One of Europe's last great wildernesses, this is also the domain of more polar bears than people, a terrain rich in epic legends of polar exploration.

thewaterfrontrestaurant,https://thewaterfrontrestaurant.net/why-sustainable-fishing-is-important/ ,"Why Sustainable Fishing Is Important
Why Sustainable Fishing Is Important Sustainable fishing allows humans to continually fish in oceans and other bodies of water indefinitely for edible seafood. In the past, we have quickly overfished, causing damage to ecosystems and pushing them out of balance. Having a single species become endangered or extinct affects more than that species alone—it also affects other animals in the ecosystem that prey on or that are prey for the aforementioned species. Overfishing can cause a negative domino effect in water-based ocean systems that is difficult to stop. Although environmental concerns are chief among those pushing sustainable fishing, it is important to note that overfishing and damaging ecosystems also directly affects the seafood we eat. Overfishing can cause a lack of fish species, and it can also cause health issues for the remaining species. Those are a few of the reasons why more fisheries and harvesters around the world are focusing on sustainable fishing instead of just trying to get the biggest haul. Sustainable fishing allows us to keep eating delicious seafood long into the future, while also protecting the beautiful water based ecosystems that protect much of the life on Earth. More sustainable fisheries are popping up, where managers track seafood as populations are managed and kept up with local, state, and federal regulations. Most states now have strict regulations on commercial fishing and require fishing licenses to get started. The more education our harvesters and seafood lovers have, the better the chance sustainable fishing will catch on for good. Seafood eaters need to support the practice of sustainable fishing in order for it to really thrive. In the past few years, it looks like just that has happened, with more and more fishers turning to sustainable practices that benefit everyone. .

carboncraftgroup,https://carboncraftgroup.com/svalbard-global-seed-vault-the-sustainability-of-our-planet/ ,"Acting as the “Emergency Rescue Plan” in case of a global catastrophe, the Svalbard Seed Vault could be the most essential vault on our planet.
While many businesses are busy filling their safes with financial gains, Norway had a different idea. Well, the country thought of preserving our planet for the next generations, if in the unlikely scenario of getting wiped out from the face of the earth.
So what is Svalbard Global Seed Vault and why should we care?
In Collaboration With:
Svalbard Global Seed Vault Preservation Initiative
The vault is located on the faraway island of Spitsbergen in the Norwegian archipelago. This island was very important for whale hunting during the 18th century. However, in the 19th century, the industrial revolution changed the face of the region. Coal mining started to emerge as an inevitable power source. Consequently, this made several families relocate there.
Today, Svalbard is a demilitarized free economic zone, which serves as a fertile land for the seeds project. It is an initiative by the Norwegian government which opened the vault in February 2008. The project’s cost is approximately USD 9 million.
In 1986 conservationists put the seeds of 17 crops in an Arctic coal mine to see how they'll fare over a century in the permafrost. Here's what they've found so far: https://t.co/zWWNC42Jqp #Svalbard pic.twitter.com/kYvxrHTkli — Adam Vaughan (@adamvaughan_uk) March 12, 2020
The location is somehow isolated in the Northern part of Norway. This, combined with the cold Arctic Ocean makes it a perfect preservation spot. As a matter of fact, this site’s cold conditions preserve the seeds in the event the vault’s cooling system fails. Actually, a temperate of -18 degrees Celsius is required for the ideal storage of the seeds.
The vault acts as a gene bank to host seeds from plant varieties. Today, it houses the world’s largest collection of crop diversity.
What Makes Svalbard Seed Vault Different from Other Gene Banks
The idea of a gene bank is not foreign. Many gene banks store plant seeds in what becomes a “seed bank”. However, for animals and humans, the process is a bit more complicated but not impossible. Hollywood may have fantasized the notion of freezing humans for later awaking in the future, but we are not very far-off in reality.
Let's Choose Healthy!
For Svalbard, currently it focuses on crop seeds preservation with Cary Fowler, an American conservationist, leading the way for accepting new plant seeds. Therefore, seeds come from all over the world.
Svalbard Global Seed Vault Mechanism
Contributions from countries in Europe like Ireland, Switzerland and Netherlands are among the pioneers. Additionally, Canada and the USA contribute heavily to the project. More recently, countries such as Colombia, Mexico, Syria and Lebanon have also sent their samples. However, in September 2015, there was a claim that the Syrian Civil War prompted the first withdrawal of seeds from the vault.
This shows the scale of the projects that spans across 100 countries in contributions. However, depositors retain ownership rights over the seeds sent to the facility. Also, they solely can allow others to borrow them.
The vault stores seeds in a controlled environment and has the possibility to house approximately 4.5 million seed samples. Each variety will contain an average of 500 seeds in a three-ply foil, then contained in protective boxes. Consequently, a maximum of 2.5 billion seeds may be stored. As a result, the vault currently contains one-third of the fundamental crops worldwide.
Moreover, the vault’s place is very safe close to 130 meters above sea level. Special engineering skills constructed it to withstand earthquakes up to a magnitude of 10 on the Richter’s scale.
As of March 2018, the Norwegian government planned more than USD 13 million worth of additional improvements to the Svalbard Global Seed Vault. This includes a new concrete tunnel and electrical units to cool and heat sections of the facility when needed. Last but not least, a new service building for emergency power backup is a vital component of the project.
With all this in mind, it becomes very clear why such vault is essential for our planet. It assures the sustainability of plant species that might go extinct. Therefore, the world is becoming better every day and we are learning the importance of sustaining life and enhancing all of its aspects. .

The overexploitation of the seas and oceans is leaving them without fish. This is confirmed by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) in one of its latest reports, which calls for a sustainable fishing model to ensure the survival of species and fishing activity.
SUSTAINABLE FISHERIES
The survival of marine fauna depends on sustainable fishing
#environmental sustainability #nature #economy
The overexploitation of the seas and oceans is leaving them without fish. This is confirmed by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) in one of its latest reports, which calls for a sustainable fishing model to ensure the survival of species and fishing activity.
The peace and silence that reign in the ocean depths are increasingly being disturbed. At first glance, life under water continues as normal, but behind this infinite calm lies a terrible secret: the underwater world is becoming empty. The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) states in its 2018 Living Planet report that since 1950 we have extracted almost 6 billion tons of fish and other invertebrates from the seas which makes the fishing industry the main threat to marine wildlife.
PROBLEMS CAUSED BY OVERFISHING
The loss of marine biodiversity also has negative consequences for the more than 3 billion people in the world who live off the richness of the seas and coasts, according to the United Nations (UN), as well as for the fishing fleets that are forced to sail hundreds of kilometres further to cast their nets in more productive waters.
These forced journeys in turn create new problems such as the overexploitation of other fishing grounds and the outbreak of territorial conflicts, especially off the coasts of Africa, Latin America, and south and north-east Asia, the continent with the greatest fishing activity in the world. In addition, the impoverishment of the seas, together with the lack of resources in the poorest fleets, encourages illegal fishing, which generates 36 billion dollars annually, degrades marine ecosystems and endangers food security.
THE STATE OF MARINE FAUNA
The UN Food and Agriculture Agency (FAO) asserts that the increase in intensive fishing has compromised the survival of 33.1% of commercial species, leaving them without time to recover between catches. For example, in 2018, the FAO published a report that stated overfishing in the South-East Pacific and the South-West Atlantic affects more than 58% of the fish populations that inhabit them, while in the Mediterranean and the Black Sea the figure exceeds 62%.
The State of World Fisheries and Aquaculture, a report published biannually by the FAO, warns that fish production has doubled since 1960. In 2016, it broke its historical record with 171 million tons and an average consumption of 20.3 kilos per year person. This exponential increase in demand has led to the overexploitation of species such as the Alaska pollock, the anchovy and skipjack tuna, among others, which endangers food sustainability.

VER INFOGRAFÍA: The state of the world's fisheries [PDF]
ADVANTAGES OF SUSTAINABLE FISHING
Sustainable fishing is a more artisanal and small-scale method with social, economic and environmental benefits, some of which are based on the FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries. Some of these are summarised below:
Protects marine fauna
Sustainable fishing respects marine ecosystems and adapts to the reproductive rate of fish to maintain a balance and ensure the survival of all species.
Uses selective methods
Sustainable fishing rejects the indiscriminate capture of fry and endangered species or those without commercial value.
Avoids waste
In sustainable fishing, the bycatch is used, for example, to make fishmeal to minimise food waste.
Contributes to food security
Sustainable small-scale fisheries account for 66% of all catches destined directly for human consumption.
Generates jobs and is more responsible
Sustainable artisanal fishing provides employment for 90% of the global fishing industry and is the basis for the development of small fishing communities.
Reduces pollution
Sustainable fishing generates less waste, minimises energy consumption and reduces the use of chemicals that damage the ozone layer.
Certifies the sustainability of the catches
International standards such as the MSC (Marine Stewardship Council) Standard determine whether a fishery is sustainable and is being well-managed.
The opposite of sustainable fishing is the so-called destructive fishing. The latter uses more aggressive methods — such as trawling —, makes indiscriminate catches and prioritises productivity over environmental protection. In addition, it only uses 60% of each catch and uses polluting gases such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs).
SUSTAINABLE AQUACULTURE
Fish farming, both in coastal and inland areas, is a booming activity worldwide. The FAO believes that a sustainable aquaculture strategy is based on these six principles:
- Fair remuneration for aquaculturists for their work.
- Equitable distribution of the costs and benefits.
- The creation of wealth and high-quality employment.
- A model that guarantees food security.
- Environmental management that benefits future generations.
- Sustainable growth and the proper organisation of authorities and industry. . ",False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False
hurtigrutensvalbard,https://hurtigrutensvalbard.com/en/about-svalbard/stories-from-svalbard/hurtigruten-launches-hybrid-driven-catamarans ,"Share:
The world leader in exploration travel has partnered with the Norwegian startup Brim Explorer, introducing battery powered catamarans custom built for Polar water exploration.
Debuting in the spring of 2021, the 24-meter vessel will operate a variety of daily silent and sustainable ocean excursions from her homeport Longyearbyen on the Arctic island of Svalbard - operating under the Hurtigruten Svalbard brand.
-Brim and Hurtigruten found each other through our common passion for the oceans. Their vision to change the way people experience the Arctic is a perfect match to our bold sustainability ambitions. We firmly believe the future of travel is emission-free, Hurtigruten CEO Daniel Skjeldam says.
Featuring large battery packs, the hybrid catamaran will be one of the world’s most flexible electric ships. She can be charged at virtually any port and operate on batteries for 10 hours with a cruising speed of 10 knots.
-A green footprint is the future of the travel industry – in the Polar regions and elsewhere. With a great idea and dedicated partners like Hurtigruten, we have set out to build a ship unlike any the world has seen, Brim Explorer co-founder and CEO Agnes Árnadóttir.
-At Hurtigruten, we demand that partners adapt the same, strict standards on sustainability as we follow. As Hurtigruten, Brim is challenging the industry to move in a greener direction. Together we can offer an experience that is truly unique and sustainable – both for our guests and the communities and areas we visit, Skjeldam says.
-By combining wave-breaking and green technology, clean Nordic design and focus on sustainable travel, we have created the first sightseeing vessel in the world able to operate a full day on electric power, and we look forward to using our knowledge to move the travel industry in a greener direction together with Hurtigruten, Árnadóttir adds.
To fully capture wildlife both above and below the surface, the explorer catamarans will also feature hydrophones and underwater drones from another Norwegian startup already partnering with Hurtigruten – Blueye Robotics. Their drones will be introduced to several of Hurtigruten’s expedition cruise ships, as well as all Brim Explorer experiences.

oecd,http://www.oecd.org/regional/regional-policy/indigenous-communities.htm ,"This project was launched on 19 September 2017 at Wendake First Nation, Canada. It includes country case studies and a pan-OECD report that offers policy recommendations for OECD member and non-members under the auspices of OECD Regional Development Policy Committee. This work has closely involved Indigenous leaders and communities in Australia, Canada and Sweden—a network which we hope to expand in the future as we continue work on this topic.
Indigenous peoples are defined by the United Nations as those who inhabited a country prior to colonisation, and who self-identify as such due to descent from these peoples, and belonging to social, cultural or political institutions that govern them. They have unique assets and knowledge that address global challenges such as environmental sustainability and that contribute to stronger regional and national economies.
Across far too many indicators there are significant gaps between Indigenous and non-Indigenous populations
Indigenous peoples represent about 5% of the world’s population, but they comprise 15% of the world’s extreme poor and one-third of the rural poor (UN). These gaps are larger in rural and remote areas. For example, gaps in the employment rate between Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples living in urban regions is on average 8.4 percentage points across a sample of OECD member countries (Australia, Canada, Mexico, New Zealand, Sweden and the United States) whereas it is 20.2 percentage points in rural regions.
Economic development gives Indigenous peoples the opportunity to break dependency relationships, use assets that align with their objectives for development and support self-determination. Activating these opportunities depends on four interconnected elements:
