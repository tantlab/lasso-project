The largest, northernmost and newest territory of Canada, Nunavut was officially separated from the Northwest Territories in 1999. The creation of Nunavut resulted in the first major change to the Canadian map since the incorporation of the province of Newfoundland and Labrador in 1949.
Origin of the name
Nunavut means “our land” in the Inuit language of Inuktitut.
Population (2006): 30,800 Total area: 1,994,000 km2 Capital: Iqaluit Date of creation: April 1, 1999
History
The earliest traces of settlement in Canada’s Arctic date back some 4,000 years, when the first of a number of hunting societies travelled across the Bering Strait into Northern Canada. The Inuit, who make up 85 percent of Nunavut’s population, are descended from one of these societies, the Thule, whose presence dates back at least 1,000 years.
The first European contact with the Inuit came with the arrival of the Norsemen in the 11th century. They were followed by explorers in search of the Northwest Passage — first in Elizabethan times and, again, in the 19th century. Later came whalers, Hudson’s Bay Company traders, missionaries and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
The idea of dividing the Northwest Territories in two was first raised during the government of John Diefenbaker in the early 1960s. The Government went as far as introducing a bill in the House of Commons to divide the Northwest Territories. The bill was allowed to die on the Order Paper after some residents of the Eastern Arctic flew to Ottawa and told a House of Commons Committee that the people of the North had not been consulted on the matter.
The Government appointed a three-man commission to examine political development in the Canadian Arctic and to make recommendations to Parliament. The Carrothers Commission held some hearings in the north and recommended that the issue of dividing the Northwest Territories be further examined in 10 years’ time.
In 1971, the leadership of the newly created Inuit Tapirisat of Canada stated its objective of creating a new territory for the Inuit in the Eastern Arctic. They insisted that it had to be part of any final land claims agreement, in spite of objections from both the Northwest Territories government in Yellowknife and the federal government. They were successful in persuading the Northwest Territories Legislative Assembly to put the issue to public debate.
The first major test for Nunavut came in the plebiscite of 1982 in which all residents of the Northwest Territories were asked to vote on the issue of division. Proponents of division won the plebiscite 53 percent to 47 percent. Ten years of negotiations on a boundary for the new territory were followed by another plebiscite in 1992 to ratify the boundary. The Government of Canada then agreed to include the creation of Nunavut as part of the final land claims agreement that recognized Inuit ownership of 350,000 square kilometres of land. The Nunavut Act was passed by Parliament in 1993 and came into effect on April 1, 1999.
Nunavut accounts for roughly 20 percent of Canada’s land mass, making it the country’s largest political subdivision. The territory is governed by a 19-member legislative assembly that operates consensus‑style without political parties. Nunavut’s largest employer is the government. Other important economic sectors include mining, construction, tourism and traditional activities such as hunting, trapping, fishing, and arts and crafts.
Coat of arms
The Nunavut coat of arms was granted by the Right Honourable Roméo LeBlanc, Governor General of Canada, on April 1, 1999. The colours blue and gold symbolize the riches of the land, sea and sky. In the base of the shield, the inuksuk symbolizes the stone monuments that guide the people on the land and mark sacred and other special places. The qulliq, or Inuit stone lamp, represents the light and warmth of family and community.
Above, the concave arc of five gold circles refers to the life-giving properties of the sun, which arches above and below the horizon depending on the season. Also included is the North Star, Niqirtsituk, the traditional guide for navigation. More broadly, the star represents the unchanging nature of the leadership of elders in the community.
In the crest, the igloo represents the traditional life of the people and the means of survival. It also symbolizes the assembled members of the legislature meeting together for the good of Nunavut. The Royal Crown symbolizes government by and for all the people of Nunavut and the equivalent status of Nunavut with other territories and provinces in Canadian Confederation.
The tuktu (caribou) and qilalugaq tugaalik (narwhal) refer to land and sea animals that are part of the rich natural heritage of Nunavut and provide sustenance for its people. The compartment at the base is composed of land and sea and features three important species of Arctic wild flowers.
Motto
Nunavut sanginivut (Nunavut, our strength)
Flag
The flag of Nunavut was granted by the Right Honourable Roméo LeBlanc, Governor General of Canada, on April 1, 1999. It features the colours white, blue and gold, which symbolize the riches of the land, sea and sky. Red is a reference to Canada. The inuksuk and the Niqirtsituk star are also found on the coat of arms. The flag’s proportions are two by length and one by width.
Floral emblem
Nunavut’s floral emblem, the purple saxifrage (Saxifraga oppositifolia), was unanimously adopted by the Legislative Assembly of Nunavut in 2000. This wildflower is one of the three flowers depicted on the coat of arms of Nunavut. One of the first plants to flower in the Arctic spring, the purple saxifrage often grows together across the tundra; it provides a vivid, purple contrast to the snow that is often present when they flower.
Other territorial symbols
Animal
The Canadian Inuit dog (Canis familiaris borealis) is the official animal of Nunavut. Called “Qimmiq” in Inuktitut, this dog is one of the world’s oldest pure breeds and is known to have been resident in the Arctic for at least 4,000 years. It has been essential to the survival of the Inuit for generation, being the only working animal for long-range travel and a willing and capable hunting companion.
Bird
While most other birds migrate south in the early fall, Nunavut’s official bird – the rock ptarmigan (Lagopus Mutus) – is truly an arctic bird, living in Nunavut throughout the year. Called “Aqiggiq” in Inuktitut, the rock ptarmigan has earned a place in the art, folklore and diet of indigenous peoples.
Distinct from most other birds with its three variations of plumage instead of the usual two, the rock ptarmigan faces its biggest challenge to survival in the winter, when snow and wind conditions make food and shelter hard to find. Features of the bird mirror human adaptations to the harsh Arctic surroundings, such as its feet feathered right down to the toes. This helps keep the rock ptarmigan warm, acting as a pair of feathery snowshoes to prevent the bird from sinking into the snow.
- Date modified: . Refurbishment of Eureka Weather Station and surrounding facilities on Ellesmere Island, Nunavut
Summary of a strategic assessment of effects on the environment regarding the plan for the refurbishment of Eureka Weather Station and surrounding facilities on Ellesmere Island, Nunavut.
Budget 2019 provided funding over 5 years for infrastructure investments at the Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) custodial site in Eureka, Nunavut. The site is part of a network of High Arctic Weather Stations and serves as a weather station and science facility. It is a key location for undertaking the following activities:
• real-time climate and water observations
• snow and ice surveys
• scientific research program to understand northern weather and climate patterns
The refurbishment of Eureka is to include the following key elements:
• runway recapitalization to address runway degradation and maintain safe landing in the summer months
• freshwater reservoir and sewage system upgrade to enable full sewage treatment and address sealing issues in the station’s freshwater reservoir
• decommissioning of 12 buildings that are no longer in use
• recapitalization of fuel tanks and power house infrastructure, as fuel tanks are beyond their expected life and power generators needs refreshed protection
• recapitalization of the main complex, which serves as a critical life support for all the occupants at the site
• recapitalization of the Ridge laboratory, including the renovation of the heating, ventilation, air conditioning and plumbing systems
The direct outcomes of the refurbishment include:
• improved resilience of Eureka infrastructure
• reduced risks of local contamination
• cleaner and more carbon efficient government operations
The indirect, longer term outcomes of the refurbishment include:
• weather forecasting for the benefit and safety of Canadians through ongoing collection of critical weather data
• evidence-based climate policy through continuing atmospheric and climate change research
The strategic environmental assessment concluded that the plan will support the following Federal Sustainable Development Strategy (FSDS) goals and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs):
• Effective action on climate change: the site will be used to conduct atmospheric and climate change research to produce scientific knowledge supporting evidence-based climate policy making which also contributes to SDG 13 Climate action
• Greening government: renovating Eureka’s structures, heating and operating is expected to result in more energy efficient operations which also contributes to SDG 12 Responsible consumption and production
• Modern and resilient infrastructure: strengthening climate resiliency of Eureka through upgrading the runway and the water infrastructure which also contributes to SDG 13 Climate action
• Safe and healthy communities: upgrading freshwater reservoirs, sewage treatment lagoon, fuel storage, decommissioning old buildings, upgrading the runway, and the use of water-related research will make this site safer which also contributes to SDG 3 Good health and well-being
Maintaining the Eureka site infrastructure will ensure the continued delivery of environmental observations and climate monitoring activities that contribute to evidenced-based decisions about health and safety, and support informed socio-economic policy making. The public and airfield access also support economic growth from commercial and recreational aircrafts.
Follow-up on this plan will occur annually and the results will be reported in ECCC's Departmental Results Report.
- Date modified: . Canada Supports Sustainable Development of Inuit-Owned Land in Iqaluit
News release
August 28, 2019 Iqaluit, Nunavut Natural Resources Canada
The best solutions for combating climate change in rural and remote Indigenous communities come from the people who live there. That is why Canada is investing in these communities and supporting community-driven economic development projects that use less diesel fuel and more renewable energy ̶— driving economic prosperity while protecting our environment.
The Honourable Amarjeet Sohi, Canada’s Minister of Natural Resources, today announced a $1.2-million investment for Qikiqtaaluk Business Development Corporation (QBDC) to identify the best way to apply renewable energy in the planned development of Inuit-owned land in Iqaluit.
QBDC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Qikiqtaaluk Corporation, will conduct a front-end engineering and design (FEED) study to determine the best approach to integrate solar and wind power, energy storage and the latest monitoring and control systems into a better electricity system. The study will identify the best mix of energy sources to support the sustainable development of the land.
The development is anticipated to support an estimated $300–400 million in infrastructure investment over a
10–15 year period and will include a net-zero-energy-ready hotel, garage complex and offices, commercial and retail spaces, housing and public areas.
The study will enable more sustainable development of the Inuit-owned land, helping to reduce fossil fuel use and greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality and create jobs.
The federal government’s investment comes from Natural Resources Canada’s Clean Energy for Rural and Remote Communities Program, which supports a more sustainable and clean energy future by investing in projects that reduce reliance on fossil fuels in Canada’s rural and remote communities. The program is part of the Government of Canada’s more than $180-billion Investing in Canada infrastructure plan.
Canada’s climate plan includes measures to protect the environment and leave a healthier planet for future generations, including actions to protect our oceans, phase out coal-fired electricity, invest in renewables and public transit and reduce plastic pollution. Green infrastructure and renewable energy technologies are a key part of Canada’s plan to combat climate change while growing the economy.

- Date modified: . eBird Canada: Northwest Territories and Nunavut
The Northwest Territories/Nunavut (NWT/NU) Bird Checklist Survey was initiated in 1995 by the Canadian Wildlife Service in response to needs identified in the Canadian Landbird Monitoring Strategy for better monitoring of arctic breeding birds and birds with primarily northern ranges. In 2012, the NWT/NU Bird Checklist Survey was integrated into eBird Canada. eBird is an on-line, real time checklist program for birds seen anywhere in the world. All historical data collected by the NWT/NU Bird Checklist Survey has been uploaded and any future data will be inputted directly into the eBird database. By integrating the checklist program into eBird, the data entry process is streamlined, more observers are able to submit and track their data, and everyone has access to the observations.
Checklist data can provide a great deal of useful information that is otherwise difficult to collect in a large, remote area like the North. By working cooperatively with volunteers, a database of bird sightings is being used as baseline information for further studies, environmental assessments, and more accurate mapping of bird distributions. It is hoped that the database could be used to detect major bird population changes in all regions of the north through increased participation in the program.
Data requests
All historical data collected through the NWT/NU Checklist Survey and any observations submitted to eBird can be requested from the eBird website. You will need an eBird account to request a data download. eBird also provides instant access to data summaries such as range maps, species abundance charts and geographic hotspots for bird activity. Data summaries and downloads can be accessed on the 'Explore Data' page on the eBird website.
How to participate
All you need to participate is an eBird account and the ability to identify birds. Once you have collected your data, you can submit it directly online at the eBird website on the 'Submit Observations' page.
You may wish to use our data form, called a checklist, to record your data in the field. The form contains all the necessary fields for submitting data to the eBird database and also includes a comprehensive list of species for the Northwest Territories and Nunavut.
If you would like contribute data but do not want to create an eBird account, simply mail your completed checklist hardcopies or scan electronic copies to NWTChecklist@ec.gc.ca. We also accept spreadsheets or field notes, assuming they conform to eBird methodology.
NWT/Nunavut bird checklist survey newsletters
The NWT/Nunavut Bird Checklist Survey was the first program to gather widespread data on birds in the north. This program has helped to better our understanding of species' distributions and abundances throughout much of the territories. In the past, the NWT/NU Checklist Survey published an annual newsletter, which highlighted the progress of the program, interesting observations, and stories about northern birders.

- Date modified: . Nunavut residents to benefit from high speed internet
News release
Iqaluit, Nunavut, August 19, 2019—Canadians understand the importance of creating successful, sustainable communities and investing in ways to connect with each other in our increasingly digital world. For Northern communities, connectivity is key to supporting economic growth, improving service delivery and creating opportunities to the benefit of all Canadians.
Today the Honourable Bernadette Jordan, Minister of Rural Economic Development and the Honourable Lorne Kusugak, Minister of Community and Government Services, announced joint funding for the undersea fibre optic cable project in Nunavut.
The project involves installing approximately 1,700 kilometres of submarine fibre optic cable from Nuuk, Greenland to Iqaluit through the Davis Strait. The cable in Iqaluit will have a branch to Kimmirut. Access to a fibre optic network will reduce both communities’ dependence on satellite communications for internet, connecting up to 3215 households in Nunavut to high speed internet services. In addition, enhanced service will be available to schools, businesses, health facilities and government facilities.
Connecting Iqaluit and Kimmirut to fibre optic cable will result in greater satellite bandwidth and faster internet for other communities in Nunavut.
Once complete, all households in Iqaluit and Kimmirut should have access to improved connectivity which will help residents stay in touch with friends and family across the country with ease. Residents in these communities will also have access to higher quality online education and be able to connect with emergency and medical services to get the help they need in a more efficient and timely matter.
The Government of Canada is investing over $151 million in this project under the Rural and Northern Communities Infrastructure Stream (RNIS) of the Investing in Canada Infrastructure Plan. The Government of Nunavut has already committed $30 million towards the project.
Quotes
“Increased access to high speed internet supports economic growth and is key for the long-term prosperity of Nunavut. This project will allow communities to be better connected and ensure residents have improved access to online services and tools whether at home, work or on the road.”
The Honourable Bernadette Jordan, Minister of Rural Economic Development
“Today, we are one step closer to connecting Nunavummiut with each other and the world through reliable, affordable and efficient telecommunications. The Government of Nunavut is committed to closing the digital gap that separates our territory and ensuring our communities are the direct recipients of the social and economic benefits of a new and dependable digital infrastructure.”
The Honourable Lorne Kusugak, Minister of Community and Government Services
Quick facts
Through the Investing in Canada infrastructure plan, the Government of Canada is investing more than $180 billion over 12 years in public transit projects, green infrastructure, social infrastructure, trade and transportation routes, and Canada’s rural and northern communities. $2 billion of this funding is supporting infrastructure projects that meet the unique needs of rural and northern communities like facilities to support food security, local access roads and enhanced broadband connectivity. In addition, $400 million is being delivered through the Arctic Energy Fund to advance energy security in the territories.$4 billion of this funding is supporting infrastructure projects in Indigenous communities.
On June 27, 2019, the Government of Canada launched two new strategies: Canada’s Connectivity Strategy, which commits to connect all Canadians to high-speed Internet, and Canada’s first Rural Economic Development Strategy, which will spur economic growth and create good, middle class jobs for rural Canadians across the country.
The Rural Economic Development Strategy leverages ongoing federal investments and provides a vision for the future, identifying practical steps to take in the short term, and serving as a foundation to guide further work.
Central to Canada’s Connectivity Strategy are historic new investments that are mobilizing up to $6 billion toward universal connectivity. They include a top-up to the Connect to Innovate Program, a new Universal Broadband Fund, and investments from the Canada Infrastructure Bank.
On July 24, 2019, the Government of Canada announced $85 million in funding to the Canadian Satellite company Telesat, to build and test innovative technologies for its low-earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellation. This will significantly improve global connectivity to serve the smaller (non-fibre) communities and expand high-speed Internet coverage to rural and remote regions throughout Canada, including the Far North. This initiative is complimentary to the fibre optic project in Nunavut and can provide back-up connectivity to Iqaluit and Kimmirut in the event of a cable outage.

- Date modified: . Recovery Centre Coming to Nunavut
News release
August 19, 2019 — Iqaluit, Qikiqtaaluk Region NU — Government of Nunavut, Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated, Indigenous Services Canada
Improving mental wellness for Inuit in Nunavut means providing better access to care that is culturally appropriate, closer to home, effective, and sustainable.
The Partnership Table on Health, the Government of Nunavut, Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated and Government of Canada's came together to sign a joint declaration of intent for the construction and operations of a Nunavut Recovery Centre which will provide treatment in Nunavut for addictions and trauma.
Many Nunavummiut continue to struggle with the impacts of historical and intergenerational trauma, as well as addictions and substance misuse. The Nunavut Recovery Centre will provide a range of treatment and healing interventions that will address both addictions and trauma, and will be founded on Inuit cultural practices and values. Clinical counseling services will also be incorporated. The Recovery Centre is part of a system wide approach that includes on the land treatment and healing, as well as support for Inuit workforce development and capacity.
With this Recovery Centre being located in Iqaluit, it will also welcome pregnant women from across Nunavut to provide them with access to tools, information and resources to support their healing journey even before the birth of their child, so as to contribute to other available services to help prevent Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD).
This Centre is addressing the need for a comprehensive, system-wide approach to healing, substance use and trauma treatment in Nunavut, as was identified in the Truth and Reconciliation Commission Call to Action #21 and the Qikiqtani Truth Commission's recommendation #2. The approach has been developed based on the feasibility study endorsed by the Government of Nunavut, Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated and the Government of Canada in February 2018.
This announcement stems from the work of the Nunavut Partnership Table on Health. The leadership of this table ensures that services will be Inuit-led and informed, and include a family-based approach that builds on cultural strengths and Inuit societal values. The joint declaration of intent outlines the commitment of all partners to support Inuit in defining and taking action on their health priorities, and promotes culturally relevant approaches which are informed by strong partnerships at the community and territorial level.
The Government of Canada is committed to a renewed Inuit-Crown relationship to make progress on the issues that are most important, including health and wellness.

Tensions continue between Baffinland and Inuit leaders at an expansion hearing for the Mary River mine, but yesterday it was the organization running the technical hearing that participants were frustrated with.
As the hearing agenda falls behind — on Friday morning participants were still working through Monday’s scheduled presentations — the Nunavut Impact Review board has begun restricting the number of questions each party can ask for Baffinland, per presentation.
Now community representatives from hamlets and hunters and trappers organizations are saying for the hearing record that the process is not supporting Inuit interests.
“NIRB has stated on a few occasions that they are limiting questions to interveners in the interest of time. I implore you to put more weight on the interests of Inuit,” said Lori Idlout, technical advisor for the Ikajutit Hunters and Trappers Organization in Arctic Bay, on Thursday.
“The image in my mind is that NIRB is using Baffinland’s bulldozer to complete the hearings as quickly as possible,” she said.
Pond Inlet’s hunters and trappers organization criticized participating governments for not having more questions.
“This project deserves and needs more work, and more attention, and that is what we bring to the table. More questions, not less, are absolutely necessary,” Eric Ootoovak, chairperson for the Mittimatalik Hunters and Trappers Association, told the board.
“Instead of developing more questions based on what we’ve heard, our technical advisor has spent two days trying to find ways to cut corners and limit our incredibly important questions.”
This process is not giving us enough time to speak.– Eric Ootoovak, chairperson, Mittimatalik Hunters and Trappers Organization
Igloolik’s mayor, Merlyn Recinos, called it “unacceptable” and “insulting” to restrict a process that fulfils Canada’s duty to consult with Inuit.
“Procedural fairness to Inuit communities and Inuit participants during this proceeding has not been given,” he said.
Recinos acknowledged that some questions may sound repetitive, as numerous technical meetings and hearings have been held for the expansion review over the last few years.
Review board says it’s saving time for community voices
This technical hearing is meant to review any outstanding concerns regarding a proposal to increase production at the iron ore mine on north Baffin Island from six million tonnes to 12 million tonnes annually.
The project includes building a railway to replace a current trucking road used to transport iron ore, and significantly increase the number of ore carriers used to ship the product out of Milne Inlet.
The small inlet opens into Eclipse Sound, a primary summering area for Nunavut’s largest population of narwhal. After years of negotiations, communities say they still haven’t been given a clear picture of how the mine will impact Inuit land use and hunting rights for themselves and following generations.
“This process is not giving us enough time to speak,” said Ootoovak.
The Nunavut Impact Review Board says using time wisely will allow more Inuit voices to be heard next week during a five-and-a-half-day community round table discussion.
In its mandate, the Nunavut Impact review Board calls itself an “institution of public government created by the Nunavut Agreement to assess potential impacts of proposed development in the Nunavut settlement area.”
The NIRB makes recommendations to the minister of Northern Affairs. The Government of Canada will have the final say on whether or not to approve the project.
Hamlets and hunters groups have yet to give their presentations and share evidence from their own environmental experts.
Clarity needed on mine’s use of Inuit knowledge, hunters say
Idlout, the technical advisor with Arctic Bay’s hunters and trappers, said until communities start getting real answers, there will continue to be delays.
She said Inuit are already deeply feeling the changes to caribou, whale and char populations from current mining.
“When Baffinland is asked about those changes they are saying that they are not significant, that they have been predicted. And yet, they aren’t providing real answers about how deep those impacts are, and so there’s a mistrust,” Idlout said.
As well, she says intervenor groups still don’t know how the mine is using Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit, or traditional knowledge, to decide that doubling production can be done sustainably.
Inuit need to clearly see how, or through what methods, the mine is incorporating Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit to make sure it is being used right, Idlout said.
In response to a question about the use of traditional knowledge from Pond Inlet Mayor Joshua Arreak, Baffinland’s vice president of sustainable development, Megan Lord-Hoyle, said the mine doesn’t believe it is appropriate to create a formula for using Inuit Knowledge, but said community feedback is crucial to how the project is being planned.
Baffinland says it is using information from hundreds of community meetings to plan the expansion. Changes to the railway, made using community input, have meant that over 60 per cent of the rail line will be crossable by caribou, the mine said.
The company does have its own mandate to include Inuit Knowledge in current and future work.
“Baffinland views Inuit Qaujimanituqangit as central to the successful planning and operations of the Mary River Mine,” the mine states in an Inuit Qaujimanituqangit Management Framework filed with the NIRB registry.
“IQ (Inuit knowledge) captures knowledge of relationships and morality, core values and worldviews, as well as, environmental knowledge,” the document states.
The framework is a living document and will be updated based on outcomes and commitments from the current hearing, and from the Inuit Certainty Agreement (ICA), Baffinland spokesperson Heather Smiles said in an email.
That’s a benefit agreement negotiated between Baffinland and the Qikiqtani Inuit Association since a previous final hearing was adjourned, unfinished, in November 2019.
Baffinland and the QIA created the agreement in the hopes of addressing outstanding concerns. The mine says it represents over $1 billion in benefits for Inuit over the lifespan of the mine.
But the Mittimatalik Hunters and Trappers Organization says the agreement doesn’t address the future health of narwhal and seal. Only part of the agreement is entered on the hearing record.
“Much work remains before we know whether it will address Inuit concerns, so therefore it is wrong for Baffinland to consider the ICA at this point, especially only those parts that support Baffinland’s world view,” said Ootoovak, the organization’s chair.
The MHTO filed a motion with the board to include all of the agreement in the documents being considered by the hearings, or to strike it from the record.

The infrastructure gap puts Inuit in Nunavut at a serious disadvantage, says Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated
Inuit in Nunavut have far less access to a wide range of infrastructure such as housing, health care, transportation and education compared to other Canadians, a new report from Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated (NTI) found.
And that significant inequality makes every aspect of life more expensive while putting Arctic ecosystems at risk, the report says.
It was released on Wednesday during NTI’s annual general meeting in Cambridge Bay, Nunavut.
“When you grow up in Nunavut and you’ve never left the territory, you take for granted what is available — you think that’s normal,” NTI President Aluki Kotierk told CBC News.
“It was important for us to demonstrate the inequalities so that Nunavut Inuit could realize that lack of infrastructure and how it negatively impacts on their lives.”
Lots of talk, little action
The 259-page report aims to measure the gap in disparities as a starting point to address the inequalities.
Little has been done to measure the gap, the report says, despite years of talk from politicians.
“The infrastructure gap cannot remain just a talking point, recognized but not remedied,” the report says.
It uses 55 “indicators” of the gap across 18 “infrastructure priority areas” grouped into three categories: energy and environment; people and communities; and connections.
The priority areas include power, waste water, housing, education, health and food sovereignty. As well, ports and harbours, telecommunications, air and justice were listed.
The report says these areas overlap and compound each other through factors like climate change, state of repair and skill development.
For example, any infrastructure project in Nunavut provides an opportunity for Inuit to receive skill development, Kotierk said.
COVID-19 highlights reliance on outside workers
The Nunavut government has spent millions of dollars quarantining construction workers from outside the territory during the pandemic, she added.
“That magnifies the reliance we have on outside employees coming into our territory, which goes against the potential investment of all those dollars into building the capacity for Inuit so that we’re less reliant on outside employees,” said Kotierk.
That lack of skill development impacts other infrastructure areas like housing, according to the report.
Between 2006 and 2018, the rate of Nunavut homes in need of major repair doubled 41 per cent from 20.2 per cent, the report says.
In the rest of Canada, that rate is nearly six times lower at 7.1 per cent, according to NTI.
Factors like climate change cut across inequalities
Meanwhile, the rate of climate change impacts has long been known to be higher in the Arctic — which the report says is compounded by Nunavut’s reliance on diesel fuel.
About 50 million litres of diesel are shipped each year via sealift to Nunavut, which is the only Canadian jurisdiction without a regional power grid, NTI’s report says.
Nunavut’s reliance on diesel — which is more expensive, polluting and environmentally risky than other energy sources — is due in part to a lack of infrastructure links to the rest of Canada, the report says.
And despite Nunavut’s reliance on sealift and having 40 per cent of Canada’s shoreline, the territory has zero ports overseen by Transport Canada and only one harbour, says the report.
Other infrastructure statistics from the report comparing Nunavut to the rest of Canada include:
- Maximum residential internet speed is eight times slower and six times more expensive.
- Access to a regular healthcare provider like a doctor is six times lower.
- Per capita spending on health care is 43 times higher than Manitoba’s.
- The average length of airport runways in Nunavut is less than half the length of runways in other major Canadian cities.
- There are no heritage centres to protect cultural collections and artifacts.
Need for evidence-based research
The report says its purpose is to provide a practical way forward to address these issues.
That includes changing the narrative away from potential southern-designed solutions toward Nunavut and Inuit-specific realities, says the report.
The federal government has made a series of infrastructure commitments to the North, including helping the territory end its reliance on diesel fuel and providing broadband internet access by 2030.
But without evidence-based research like that provided in this report, it’s hard to imagine how that can happen, Kotierk said.
“If we don’t quantify it, it makes it very difficult to see if we’re making progress,” Kotierk said.

Wednesday marked the one-year anniversary of the release of Canada’s landmark report on violence against Indigenous women, and Inuit organizations observed the occasion by revoicing the importance of implementing the Inuit-specific recommendations.
“On this poignant anniversary, ITK once again thanks everyone who was involved in making the National Inquiry a powerful agent for change, including family members, survivors of violence, elders, and experts who openly spoke their truths over two years of cross-country public hearings and evidence gathering in the interest of giving power to future generations,” Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami (ITK), Canada’s national Inuit organization, said in a news release.
Canada’s National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls (MMWIG) was announced by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in 2015 after calls from many Indigenous leaders, groups and organisations to examine the high rates of violence against indigenous women in Canada.
“Unprecedented national opportunity for transformative change”: ITK
The national inquiry held 15 public community hearings, and visited each of Canada’s northern territories: Yukon in the northwest, the Northwest Territories, and Canada’s eastern Arctic territory of Nunavut. The MMWIG commissioners heard 1484 testimonies from families and survivors during this period of the inquiry. Separate hearings were also held to hear testimony from people working in institutions and from elders, academics, front-line workers and specialists.
The final report was issued on June 3, 2019.
It included 231 calls for justice, with 46 Inuit-specific recommendations that included everything from the need for better mental health services in the Arctic to the need for urgent action on the housing crisis.
“On this day and every day I affirm my commitment to fulfilling my obligations to uphold and advance the work of implementing the Calls for Justice,” said ITK president Natan Obed.
“ITK echoes the calls from families and from the National Inquiry for substantive equality for First Nations, Inuit, and Métis women and girls, and solutions based on self-determination and self-governance reflective of the distinct relationship between Inuit and the Crown.
“This is an unprecedented national opportunity for transformative change, and I urge the Government of Canada to respond to the Calls for Justice with humility and respect through all steps necessary, in partnership with Inuit, to bring about the change we all need.”
National action plan delayed
Among the calls for justice was the co-creation of a national action plan for implementing the recommendations between Indigenous, federal, provincial and territorial governments.
A national action plan was expected on Wednesday, but at the end of May, the federal government said the process had been derailed by the COVID-19 pandemic and that it wasn’t possible to give a time line for when it might be finished.
On Wednesday, Pauktuutit Inuit Women of Canada, renewed their calls for the national action to be delivered as quickly as possible.
“Together, we invested in the National Inquiry as we had hoped for real change,” Pauktuutit Pesident Rebecca Kudloo said in a statement.
“We shared the hope of a country that we could reconcile this painful past and get to a future where these things no longer happen. I know many of you are very disappointed with the delay in getting to an Inuit national action plan. Like you, the Pauktuutit Board and I will never give up and will continue our discussions with government partners and others from tomorrow.
“Your spirit and courage are with me every day. I thank you for sharing the lives of your loved ones. May their memories live on.”

United States: Alaska reckons with missing data on murdered Indigenous women, Alaska Public Media . Canada’s Arctic territory of Nunavut has an unprecedented opportunity for demonstrating to the world what sustainable development looks like in the post-fossil fuel era, says a new report commissioned by Greenpeace.
The report, entitled Beyond Fossil Fuels – Sustainable Economic Development Opportunities in Eastern Nunavut, was developed by the Centre for Sustainable Economy, said John Talberth, the centre’s president and chief economist.
“Governments tend to fall for false promises of big corporate-led economic development solutions such as mines, and oil and gas,” Talberth, the lead author of the report, told Radio Canada International in a phone interview from Oregon, U.S. “And they tend to overlook developing smaller portfolios of sustainable projects that are targeted directly at improving livelihoods for those the least well off.”
(click to listen the full interview with John Talberth) Listen
Sustainable development goals
The report makes the case that these smaller scale sustainable development solutions hold great promise, while building the economy in Nunavut based on resource extraction “is more of a curse than a blessing,” Talberth said.
Some of these key sustainable development sectors include human capital, renewable energy, culturally sensitive Indigenous tourism, and global leadership in sustainable fisheries management, Talberth said.
“Human capital is basically about skills and knowledge, it’s making sure that those in Nunavut have access to all the knowledge and skills available to anyone else in the world to help them thrive in the modern economy,” Talberth said.
The federal and territorial governments also have to call international attention to the “incredible value” of traditional ecological knowledge and the role of this traditional knowledge in sustaining livelihoods, and to make sure that this knowledge is passed on to coming generations, he said.
‘A great promise of wealth’
Getting off the dependency on fossil fuels such as diesel for generating electricity in Nunavut should be another priority for the government, he said.
“There is great potential, especially for wind and solar in that region to help reduce the consumption of fossil fuels,” Talberth said.
Developing Indigenous tourism can also make a great contribution, especially if that tourism is developed around creating ownership in the local communities rather than having cruise ships come in from afar or big centralized tourism companies operating lodges and facilities, he said.
“We think ownership of tourist resources in Indigenous communities offers a great promise of wealth,” Talberth said.
Finally, as climate changes, Arctic fisheries are likely to become more productive, he said.
“Strategic investment in helping local communities benefit from their fisheries should pay off well,” Talberth said.
Example for other Arctic jurisdictions
No one in the Nunavut premier’s office was available to comment of the report. In a brief statement released to RCI, officials said the Government of Nunavut (GN) hasn’t had an opportunity to review the Greenpeace-commissioned study.
“The GN continues to work with the federal government to advocate our unique circumstances in access to energy,” officials said in an email. “The development of energy resources and related infrastructure for Nunavut must balance environmental protection and responsible development to benefit our residents. Any independent report that contains sound and concrete ideas that would lessen our dependence on fossil fuels is welcomed.”
The authors of the study reviewed all the existing literature on this subject and conducted consultations and interviews with a number of scientists, government sources and individuals in Nunavut, Talberth said.
The recommendations in the study, which was paid for by Greenpeace, are applicable to other northern jurisdictions that face similar development challenges, Talberth said.
“We think that the solutions we are advocating for in Nunavut are identical to the solutions that will work in these other areas,” Talberth said. “In fact, we’re just finishing our report now, looking at options for sustainable development in Alaska.”
The same kind of solutions that would benefit people in Nunavut would also benefit Arctic and rural areas in Alaska, he said.
“Future generations will judge us by how well we treat those least responsible for the climate crisis but suffering the worst of its effects — including the Inuit of Nunavut,” said Daphne Wysham, Climate Justice Campaign Director at the Center for Sustainable Economy and co-author of the report. “We must ensure that the Nunavummiut don’t just survive, with their basic needs protected and assured – we must ensure that they thrive with their culture intact.” .

Over 200 polar bear hides are on their way home to Nunavut from an Ontario auction house where they have been stuck in storage — some for up to a decade.
The return comes after the Fur Harvesters Auction in North Bay, Ont., accumulated a stock of around 300 untanned Nunavut polar bear hides that it couldn’t sell. The territory says it’s about 235 hides.
A quality polar bear hide used to sell for between $12,000 and $20,000, but now a large and high grade hide goes for $5,000 at the most, says Edwin Ferguson, a fur technician.
When that market fell, buyers stopped looking for small bears.
“There’s a market for bigger bears. Anything nine feet and up you can sell very readily as long as they’re decent quality. But anything under that eight foot level is very hard to sell,” Ferguson said.
Many of the bears coming home are under that benchmark, he said.
Premier Joe Savikataaq, who is also the environment minister, and says the skins shouldn’t be abandoned.
“By reclaiming the backlog of hides from Fur Harvesters Auction, we ensure that Nunavut polar bear hides do not degrade in quality simply to sit in storage,” Savikataaq said in the Legislative Assembly on Monday.
Paid for, or given back
Because of low prices and low demand at auction, the department is telling hunters to sell their polar bear hides privately, or to keep them for traditional use.
MLAs have often asked Savikataaq about the bear hides, saying their constituents want to be paid for the bears, or get them back.
Hunters can get their bears by giving back the advance the government paid them for the hide in the first place.
But the advance could have been up to $3,000. Ferguson says, many of the untanned bear hides are no longer worth that much.
The Fur Harvesters Auction is sending them back because, under its contract with the government of Nunavut, the bears can’t be sold at a loss.
That’s why bear skins that hunters don’t want will be sold to the public or given to non-profits for community use.
“Let’s keep our traditions and culture sustainable, and use this global downturn to benefit our communities instead,” Savikataaq said.
Ferguson guessed that many of the hides sent back to the territory will be hard to use whole.
When they’re kept in storage for a long time, even at the right temperature, the untanned furs do get course because the hairs gets hollow the longer a skin dries, he said.
Another set of those hides are in good shape, he said, but couldn’t be sold internationally because they were hunted during the early 2000s when some Nunavut bears were banned from export for political reasons.
Ferguson says bear prices were high around the same time, because there were concerns that selling polar bears would become illegal.
“Everybody thought that they were going to stop us trading in them. The world did not want us to sell a polar bear to anybody. They hate the fact that they are killed and sold,” he said. “That drove the market crazy for two or three years.”
Auction still accepting Nunavut hides
The Fur Harvesters Auction kept any bear hides it knew it could sell for at least the advance money.
Ferguson says the auction is still accepting Nunavut hides to sell on behalf of hunters, but he recommends being picky about which bear you send.
He says the “big and beautiful” trophy bears get the best price internationally. Before shipping a bear, it should be washed of all stains, and dried well so it won’t get mouldy when it’s being shipped.
The hides make more money if they still have the head, with an unbroken jaw, and paws with claws that are needed to make a taxidermy rug, he said.
In its next April sale, the Fur Harvesters Auction expects to market over 100 polar bear hides from Nunavut and Northwest Territories.

Tensions continue between Baffinland and Inuit leaders at an expansion hearing for the Mary River mine, but yesterday it was the organization running the technical hearing that participants were frustrated with.
As the hearing agenda falls behind — on Friday morning participants were still working through Monday’s scheduled presentations — the Nunavut Impact Review board has begun restricting the number of questions each party can ask for Baffinland, per presentation.
Now community representatives from hamlets and hunters and trappers organizations are saying for the hearing record that the process is not supporting Inuit interests.
“NIRB has stated on a few occasions that they are limiting questions to interveners in the interest of time. I implore you to put more weight on the interests of Inuit,” said Lori Idlout, technical advisor for the Ikajutit Hunters and Trappers Organization in Arctic Bay, on Thursday.
“The image in my mind is that NIRB is using Baffinland’s bulldozer to complete the hearings as quickly as possible,” she said.
Pond Inlet’s hunters and trappers organization criticized participating governments for not having more questions.
“This project deserves and needs more work, and more attention, and that is what we bring to the table. More questions, not less, are absolutely necessary,” Eric Ootoovak, chairperson for the Mittimatalik Hunters and Trappers Association, told the board.
“Instead of developing more questions based on what we’ve heard, our technical advisor has spent two days trying to find ways to cut corners and limit our incredibly important questions.”
This process is not giving us enough time to speak.– Eric Ootoovak, chairperson, Mittimatalik Hunters and Trappers Organization
Igloolik’s mayor, Merlyn Recinos, called it “unacceptable” and “insulting” to restrict a process that fulfils Canada’s duty to consult with Inuit.
“Procedural fairness to Inuit communities and Inuit participants during this proceeding has not been given,” he said.
Recinos acknowledged that some questions may sound repetitive, as numerous technical meetings and hearings have been held for the expansion review over the last few years.
Review board says it’s saving time for community voices
This technical hearing is meant to review any outstanding concerns regarding a proposal to increase production at the iron ore mine on north Baffin Island from six million tonnes to 12 million tonnes annually.
The project includes building a railway to replace a current trucking road used to transport iron ore, and significantly increase the number of ore carriers used to ship the product out of Milne Inlet.
The small inlet opens into Eclipse Sound, a primary summering area for Nunavut’s largest population of narwhal. After years of negotiations, communities say they still haven’t been given a clear picture of how the mine will impact Inuit land use and hunting rights for themselves and following generations.
“This process is not giving us enough time to speak,” said Ootoovak.
The Nunavut Impact Review Board says using time wisely will allow more Inuit voices to be heard next week during a five-and-a-half-day community round table discussion.
In its mandate, the Nunavut Impact review Board calls itself an “institution of public government created by the Nunavut Agreement to assess potential impacts of proposed development in the Nunavut settlement area.”
The NIRB makes recommendations to the minister of Northern Affairs. The Government of Canada will have the final say on whether or not to approve the project.
Hamlets and hunters groups have yet to give their presentations and share evidence from their own environmental experts.
Clarity needed on mine’s use of Inuit knowledge, hunters say
Idlout, the technical advisor with Arctic Bay’s hunters and trappers, said until communities start getting real answers, there will continue to be delays.
She said Inuit are already deeply feeling the changes to caribou, whale and char populations from current mining.
“When Baffinland is asked about those changes they are saying that they are not significant, that they have been predicted. And yet, they aren’t providing real answers about how deep those impacts are, and so there’s a mistrust,” Idlout said.
As well, she says intervenor groups still don’t know how the mine is using Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit, or traditional knowledge, to decide that doubling production can be done sustainably.
Inuit need to clearly see how, or through what methods, the mine is incorporating Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit to make sure it is being used right, Idlout said.
In response to a question about the use of traditional knowledge from Pond Inlet Mayor Joshua Arreak, Baffinland’s vice president of sustainable development, Megan Lord-Hoyle, said the mine doesn’t believe it is appropriate to create a formula for using Inuit Knowledge, but said community feedback is crucial to how the project is being planned.
Baffinland says it is using information from hundreds of community meetings to plan the expansion. Changes to the railway, made using community input, have meant that over 60 per cent of the rail line will be crossable by caribou, the mine said.
The company does have its own mandate to include Inuit Knowledge in current and future work.
“Baffinland views Inuit Qaujimanituqangit as central to the successful planning and operations of the Mary River Mine,” the mine states in an Inuit Qaujimanituqangit Management Framework filed with the NIRB registry.
“IQ (Inuit knowledge) captures knowledge of relationships and morality, core values and worldviews, as well as, environmental knowledge,” the document states.
The framework is a living document and will be updated based on outcomes and commitments from the current hearing, and from the Inuit Certainty Agreement (ICA), Baffinland spokesperson Heather Smiles said in an email.
That’s a benefit agreement negotiated between Baffinland and the Qikiqtani Inuit Association since a previous final hearing was adjourned, unfinished, in November 2019.
Baffinland and the QIA created the agreement in the hopes of addressing outstanding concerns. The mine says it represents over $1 billion in benefits for Inuit over the lifespan of the mine.
But the Mittimatalik Hunters and Trappers Organization says the agreement doesn’t address the future health of narwhal and seal. Only part of the agreement is entered on the hearing record.
“Much work remains before we know whether it will address Inuit concerns, so therefore it is wrong for Baffinland to consider the ICA at this point, especially only those parts that support Baffinland’s world view,” said Ootoovak, the organization’s chair.
The MHTO filed a motion with the board to include all of the agreement in the documents being considered by the hearings, or to strike it from the record.

The Iqaluit Pilot Project was launched in 2007 via a comprehensive Request for Proposals for an Investment Grade Feasibility Study and Savings Financed Energy Retrofit Program addressing the GN’s 39 owned facilities in Iqaluit. The scope of the RFP included: engineering, financing, risk management, project management, training and monitoring and verification. It was won by MCW Custom Energy Solutions Ltd. (MCW CES).
Nunavut Energy
The Project
The Iqaluit Pilot Project involves the implementation of energy efficiency measures in all GN owned buildings within Iqaluit. The results of the Pilot Project will be used to roll out NEMP in other communities within Nunavut. The Iqaluit Pilot Project is currently saving the Government of Nunavut $1,242,033 annually, at a total cost of $10,609,299.
This document provides a list of the buildings included in the Pilot Project – Pilot Project Buildings.
Design Criteria
Several criteria specific to working in Nunavut had to be taken into consideration when developing the Iqaluit Pilot Project. As this was a pilot project attempts were made to identify solutions, which could be replicated in other communities. Some key ones are:
- Introduce and Monitor State-of-the-Art Technology in Eastern Arctic Conditions
Nunavut has a harsh climate, high energy and shipping prices, small remote communities, and an aging building stock. Historically, technologies are selected based on their successful use in southern communities, which contribute to increased maintenance costs and accelerated replacement. A number of technologies were selected, monitored and tested as part of the pilot project, with an eye towards replicating them in other communities.
- 5th Light: the Fifth Lighting Control System was installed in five buildings, after a monitored pilot project. Each Fifth Light DALI ballast has an IP address allowing complete control over the Internet. The Energy Manager controls the system. Savings in excess of 70% were achieved.
- Solar Domestic Hot Water: 3 buildings were outfitted with Solar Panels and the results are monitored at the site and through the fuel bills.
- CETox: CETox fuel enhancer was used to treat the heating fuel in a number of buildings, emission reductions and fuel savings were documented.
- Exterior LED Lights: Initially, exterior LED Lights were installed in four buildings, results were positive and the technology was extended to all buildings.
- Invest in Local companies/people
Extensive product training, formal training and mentoring was used to transfer knowledge to contractors and maintenance and operations staff to ensure that the new equipment and savings could be maintained. The NNI Policy was used to ensure local contractors and individuals were able to do the work.
- Competitive Bidding
The GN procurement regulations and guidelines were adhered to or exceeded. Where possible competitive biddings was the norm.
- Economic
The GN implements technologies, which recoup their costs within their lifetime and fit within the overall 3rd Party financing amortization period. All benefits are assessed, when making a decision including operating savings, avoided costs and utility savings. Only the utility savings, with a small amount of operating savings are included in the savings used to pay for the retrofit.
- Enhance Buildings
Where possible, old or failing building components were replaced even if the payback was increased. Foe example; Old Exterior Fixtures were replaced with new LED Exterior Fixtures.
- Savings Guarantee
All savings are guaranteed or stipulated. Where they are stipulated they are carefully monitored and savings established.
The Project Team
CGS Technical Services Division
The Technical Services Division is responsible for NEMP and is responsible for all aspects of the Iqaluit Pilot Project. TSD managed the development of the policy, procurement documents, negotiated the Energy Services Agreement, and manage and direct the engineering, construction, commissioning of all measures, which make up this Agreement. They also coordinate input from all client departments, and will actively monitor the savings in the years to come.
EnviroVest Energy Ventures Inc.
EnviroVest was contracted by the GN to develop the NEMP Policy and Program, the procurement documents, and assist TSD develop and award the Energy Services Agreement for the Iqaluit Pilot Project. EnviroVest is currently, advising the TSD on all aspects of the Iqaluit Pilot Project. (www.envirovest.ca)
MCW Custom Energy Solutions Ltd. (MCW CES)
After successfully, winning an open competitive competition, MCW and the GN negotiated an Agreement, whereby MCW conducted the Investment Grade Feasibility Study, designed, tendered, commissioned and managed the measures. They also negotiated the financing with ManuaLife, provide a guarantee on some of the measures and will provide the first two years of the monitoring and verification services. (www.mcw.com).
Technologies
Energy Efficiency and Conservation
Lighting Retrofits
Replacing existing lights with new energy efficient lamps and fixtures. Retrofits include replacing T12 fluorescent lights with T8s and replacing existing incandescent lights with compact fluorescents and LEDs. Other work includes redesigning some areas that are currently overly lit.
LED Lighting
Replaces existing exterior light fixtures with new LEDs. This work is slated for all buildings included in the Pilot Project.
Lighting Controls
Installing Fifth Light Technology lighting control systems in several buildings. Through the use of DALI (Dimmable Addressable Lighting Interface) ballasts and an advanced control system, light levels for each space can be set to meet the users’ specific preference and all lights can be scheduled off when the building is unoccupied.
Mechanical Upgrade
These entail a variety of retrofits to existing heating and ventilating systems, including:
- Boiler stack heat recovery (recovery heat that is normally wasted from boilers);
- Air handling unit heat recovery (recovering heat from exhaust air before it is removed from the building);
- Air handling unit variable air volume conversions (allow ventilation system flow to vary based on demand);
- Infrared heating (replacing existing steam heating with efficient oil-fired heaters);
- Motor replacements (replacing existing fan and pump motors with new energy efficient models).
Controls Upgrades
By improving the control of existing mechanical systems, a significant amount of energy can be saved through implementing new operational strategies such as equipment scheduling and temperature setbacks. This is accomplished primarily in three ways:
Building Envelope
- Installing new direct digital control (DDC) systems
- Upgrading and reprogramming existing DDC systems
- Installing programmable thermostats
Sealing around the perimeter of a building, including around doors and windows. This reduced the infiltration of cold air into a building and stops warms air from escaping.
Appliances
Replaces existing clothes washers and refrigerators with new more energy efficient models.
Water Efficiency and Conservation
Replacing existing plumbing fixtures (toilets, faucets, urinals, etc.) with new low-flow models. Especially effective is the installation of new waterless urinals, which utilize a chemical sealant in place of water.
Renewable Energy
Renewable energy technologies are an excellent way to cut down on fossil fuel dependence throughout Nunavut. They harness natural energy resources, converting them into energy that can be utilized at the building level. Several different renewable energy technologies have been installed in Iqaluit as part of the Nunavut Energy Management Program (NEMP) Iqaluit Pilot Project. Natural Resources Canada provide financial assistance to these technologies.
Solar Domestic Hot Water Heating
Solar water heating systems have been installed on three buildings in Iqaluit (Taammativvik Residence, Baffin Correctional Centre and Young Offenders Facility). These facilities are ideal for this technology due to being residences and therefore consuming more hot water (for showers, laundry, etc.) than other facilities.
Solar water heating utilizes solar collectors to collect energy from sun and transfer it to hot water. This is accomplished by passing cold water directly under the panels, where the water absorbs heat from the sun.
Solar Air Heating
A solar air heating system (or Solar Wall) has been installed on the older portion of the Baffin Regional Hospital. As with solar domestic hot water heating, energy from the sun is gathered by collectors and is transferred in this instance to air. Instead of solar panels, the collection surface consists of black metal cladding on the Hospital’s south-facing wall. The heated air is used for ventilation, reducing the amount of heat that is added to cold outdoor air before it is introduced into the building.
The Human Factor
Building Occupants
A very important part of the Iqaluit Pilot Project is the energy awareness component. Along with the energy savings produced from the introduction of new technologies (link), energy conservation can be achieved at a local building level. In this manner, building occupants play an essential role in ensuring the success of the Nunavut Energy Management Program. The day-to-day practices of building occupants can contribute significantly to the amount of energy consumed in a building and therefore informed and engaged building occupants are a key achieving energy savings!
The Government of Nunavut has published its “No Cost and Low Cost Measures for Saving Energy Guide”, which contains information on how building occupants can help to make their home/workplace more energy efficient.
Building Managers & Operators
Several initiatives have been undertaken to include building managers and operators in the energy conservation process. Building Managers and Operators are an integral part of achieving energy savings, as they control what actually goes on within buildings, including equipment operation, temperature set points, etc.
Building Operators and GN maintenance staff have also been provided with energy efficiency education via the Seneca College BES program. The Building Environmental Systems course is a college program that has been offered for the past three decades. The program is recognized by Natural Resources Canada (NRC) as the premier building systems course in Canada and as a result Seneca College has partnered with government organizations all over the country in order to bring building operations into the 21st century.
Education is an integral part of the Nunavut Energy Management Program. That’s why CGS, MCW, and The Nunavut Arctic College have all partnered with Seneca College to bring the Building Environmental Systems course to Nunavut. Currently operating as a pilot program, the NEMP will allow building operators from all over the territory to participate in a series of BES modules. As an added bonus, participating building operators are also earning college credits that can be put towards a full BES class I, II or III Certificate. By bringing the BES course to Iqaluit, the NEMP can effectively produce future generations of capable and motivated building operators that can keep Nunavut running clean and green.
For more information regarding the BES course, please see http://bes.senecac.on.ca/ Building Managers are also being involved in the project through an initiative to gain their input into how they see energy being used in their facilities. This process involves a questionnaire regarding energy use in their facility, followed by an interactive process to implement low cost and no cost measures in these facilities.
How You Can Help
The Government of Nunavut has invested in improving the energy efficiency of the various systems that it uses to heat, light and operate its buildings. We have provided training to our building managers and operators that will enable them to operate our facilities efficiency.
However you – the occupants of the buildings – use energy and water is just as important. By turning out lights when you are not using them, report leaky faucets and turning down the thermostat, you can make a difference and help the Government of Nunavut reduce its energy expenditure and reduce its energy impact on the environment.
For further information on how you can be part of the solution, refer to Save 10 or visit our energy savings tips.
Use of Local Labour
The Nunavut Energy Management Plan has been structured to take advantage of all of Nunavut’s rich natural resources – right down to its residents. That’s why the NEMP has prioritized local contracting as a way to keep Nunavut’s workforce involved in the issues that matter most to the territory. In fact, nearly all of the measures that make up the NEMP have been carried out by local contractors operating out of Iqaluit. That way, the people maintaining the local work force has become familiar with energy efficient technologies and will be better able to maintain them in the future.
As required by the Nunavummi Nangminiqaqtunik Ikajuuti (NNI) Policy, a minimum of 10% Inuit Labour is required for all work performed as part of the project. In many instances, this figure was greatly exceeded, including work performed by Inuit-owned companies.
Financing
Third party financing for the project was provided by MCW CES. The financing model used allows for the energy savings to pay for the construction cost of the project, meaning that no capital investment is required by the Government of Nunavut.
Project Replication
Energy conservation is an important part of Nunavut’s future. With the rising cost of energy in the Canadian North, programs such as the NEMP allow the territory to save both money and resources. Though the NEMP launched in Iqaluit, its merits and message are universal. The successes of the Iqaluit Pilot Project will be used to replicate the project in other communities within Nunavut. . Nunavut
Energy Management Program
Welcome to the Department of Community and Government Services (CGS) Energy Management Website.
Community and Government Services (CGS) works in partnership with community governments and assists them in building their capacity so that they can meet the needs of their residents. We provide programs and funding that support core municipal operation, infrastructure development, and land development.
With the rising cost of energy in the Canadian North, energy and the use of clean domestic renewable energy are an important part of Nunavut’s future. Our energy efficiency target is 20% in our owned buildings. Our strategy is to successfully retrofit our buildings in Iqaluit with innovative energy efficiency and renewable energy systems: successes, which can be replicated in other northern communities.
This website outlines how the CGC is working to achieve its energy efficiency goals, as well as providing information on how the our building occupants can incorporate energy efficient behaviour into their everyday routine at work, at home and on the road.

Nunavut Energy Management Program . Ahiak, Beverly and Qamanirjuaq Herds
Ahiak herd
The Ahiak caribou calve in the vicinity of the Adelaide Peninsula (eastern Queen Maud Gulf) east to Pelly Bay, Nunavut. The herd spends most summers in the Queen Maud Gulf Migratory Bird Sanctuary. The fall and spring migration leads them through, and south of, the Thelon Game Sanctuary, which extends their winter range into the NWT. The herd will winter on the barrens and in the boreal forest in the area northwest of the Saskatchewan border to the north side of Great Slave Lake. The Ahiak herd overlaps with the Bathurst caribou herd on the west and the Qamanirjuaq and Beverly herds to the east.
The Government of Nunavut's most recent population survey (2011) estimates the Ahiak herd at 71,000 animals.
The Ahiak herd is inter-jurisdictional and its annual range includes Nunavut, the Northwest Territories (NWT) and, to a lesser extent, Saskatchewan. The herd is within the jurisdiction of Wek'eezhii Renewable Resources Board and the Nunavut Wildlife Management Bopard as well as the Governments of Nunavut (GN) and the NWT (GNWT). As of 2015, there is no management plan or specific process for the Ahiak herd.
Resident, outfitted and commercial harvest of caribou within the NWT portion of the Ahiak herd has been suspended since 2010. In January 2014, the GNWT opened up a limited one tag bull-only resident harvest in the range of the Ahiak and Beverly caribou herds.
Beverly herd
The range used by the Beverly herd extends from the boreal forests of Saskatchewan, across the subarctic taiga of the NWT, to the Arctic tundra of west-central Nunavut. The range overlaps with the Bathurst caribou herd on the west, and Qamanirjuaq and Ahiak caribou herds on the east.
The herd calves in both the Western Queen Maud Gulf area and the traditional calving grounds near Beverly Lake in Nunavut. A population survey was done by the Government of Nunavut in 2018. Preliminary results estimate the size of the Beverly herd at 103,000 animals.
Resident, outfitted and commercial harvest of caribou within the NWT portion of the Beverly herd has been suspended since 2010. In January 2014, the GNWT opened up a limited one tag bull-only resident harvest in the range of the Ahiak and Beverly caribou herds.
Management authorities for the Beverly herd are the Governments of Nunavut, NWT and Saskatchewan, the Nunavut Wildlife Management Board and the Beverly and Qamanirjuaq Caribou Management Board.
Qamanirjuaq herd
The range of the Qamanirjuaq herd straddles Manitoba and Nunavut with portions in the southeast NWT and northeast Saskatchewan. The herd calves in the vicinity of Qamanirjuaq Lake in the Kivalliq Region of Nunavut. The range overlaps with Beverly and Ahiak herds to the west. The herd was estimated at 288,000 in 2017.
The Beverly and Qamanirjuaq Caribou Management Board helps manage the herd. . Many barren-ground caribou herds have declined significantly in recent years, despite efforts to reduce hunting pressures and manage disturbance to caribou.
The GNWT works with its co-management partners to make decisions about the herds that reflect the values and concerns of our communities, and recognize and respect Aboriginal and treaty rights in the NWT.
In this section
- How many barren-ground caribou herds are in the Northwest Territories?
- How does the GNWT track caribou movements and population trends?
- How are barren-ground caribou managed in the NWT?
- How are we supporting barren-ground caribou recovery?
- Other resources
How many barren-ground caribou herds are in the Northwest Territories?
Barren-ground caribou are the most abundant and widespread subspecies of caribou found in the Northwest Territories (NWT). They are characterized by long seasonal migrations between winter and summer ranges. Nine distinct barren-ground caribou herds spend all or part of their annual cycle in the taiga forests and tundra of the NWT mainland; many are shared with neighbouring jurisdictions.
Historical NWT barren-ground herd ranges and calving areas (1996-2018)
How does the GNWT track caribou movements and population trends?
The GNWT uses regular aerial surveys along with satellite telemetry (collars) to help us better understand caribou movements and population trends. The surveys are conducted every three years in collaboration with Indigenous government and organizations, the Government of Nunavut, renewable resources boards and communities that depend on the herds. The most recent surveys took place in 2018.
We have also been working with scientific and traditional knowledge experts to better understand pressures affecting caribou. The GNWT provides support for traditional knowledge and community-based caribou research and monitoring programs, including the Tłı̨chǫ Boots on the Ground Caribou Monitoring Program and the Łutsel Kʼe Dene First Nation Moccasins on the Ground program.
How are barren-ground caribou managed in the NWT?
Co-management processes, established under land claim agreements in the Inuvialuit, Gwich'in, Sahtú and Tłı̨chǫ settlement areas provide direction and advice to governments on management of caribou and habitat using traditional and scientific knowledge. The GNWT also works with Indigenous communities and organizations in southern parts of the NWT where claims are not yet settled.
Our cooperative approach to managing barren-ground caribou is guided by two overarching documents:
- Taking Care of Caribou was developed by a committee of six co-management boards who share authority for three northern caribou herds: the Bluenose-West, Bluenose-East and Cape Bathurst. It addresses the long-term caribou management and stewardship of these three herds.
The Northwest Territories Barren-ground Caribou Management Strategy provides overall guidance for the management and long-term sustainability of all NWT barren-ground caribou herds.
For the Bluenose-East herd in the Sahtú, the community of Délįne has developed its own caribou conservation plan, Belare wı́lé Gots’ę́ Ɂekwę́, which defines community-based management of this herd in the context of regional management with the Sahtú Renewable Resources Board and ENR. Self-limitation and self-directed management actions arrived at by consensus have been viewed as the preferred approach by Délįne.
There are also herd-specific management plans for the Porcupine, Beverly and Qamanirjuaq herds, as well as a Bathurst Caribou Range Plan that helps decision-makers manage activities on the land in a way that supports the recovery of the Bathurst herd.
How are we supporting barren-ground caribou recovery?
In 2018, barren-ground caribou (not including the Porcupine herd) were added to the NWT List of Species at Risk as a Threatened species. An NWT recovery strategy will be released in 2020.
Measures to help the recovery and long-term sustainability of the herds include co-management activities related to harvest, habitat and predation.
Harvest
There is no non-resident harvest of barren-ground caribou in the Northwest Territories, and resident harvest is limited. Many herds also have harvest restrictions for Indigenous hunters that have been put in place through co-management processes. Contact your local or regional ENR office to find out about restrictions in your area.
Habitat
While habitat disturbance from development is a major cause of decline in many southern caribou populations (e.g. boreal caribou and southern mountain caribou in B.C.), the ranges of most barren-ground caribou in the Northwest Territories have little to no human-caused disturbance. Still, the same downward trends or low population levels are being seen across the North. Ensuring each barren-ground caribou herd has healthy year-round habitat and the opportunity to migrate freely across its range will be important for the long-term welfare of the herds.
The Bathurst Caribou Range Plan was developed with communities and co-management partners to help protect key habitat, allow for seasonal movements and reduce disturbance of Bathurst caribou. Released in 2019, this plan provides guidance for decision-makers to manage activities in a way that keeps the land healthy for caribou.
Predation
Wolves are the primary predator of barren-ground caribou. To help address the significant declines we have seen in the Bathurst and Bluenose-East caribou herds over the last few years, the GNWT and Tłı̨chǫ Government developed a joint proposal for wolf management in the North Slave Region. Reducing wolf predation, together with ongoing caribou harvest restrictions and other management actions, can help increase caribou survival and give these herds a better chance to recover.
Learn more about our approach to wolf management: . INITIATIVES
The following initiatives form Community and Government Services’ contribution to Ikummatiit – the Government of Nunavut’s overall energy strategy.
Nunavut Energy Management Program (NEMP)
The Nunavut Energy Management Program
(NEMP) is a territory-wide initiative being undertaken by the Government of Nunavut. The NEMP will reduce energy and water consumption and fossil fuel dependence while increasing energy awareness and community involvement.
Green Purchasing Policy
The Green Procurement Policy is being developed to mandate the purchase of Energy Star Rated equipment, which is 10% to 35% more energy efficient than existing equipment. This will directly contribute to the GN’s energy savings targets under Ikummatiit and to the energy savings in leased and private buildings. The Government of Nunavut is reviewing costs and benefits of incorporating environmental costs into its purchasing decisions. At the moment, employees are encouraged to use the Good Building Practices Guideline
.
Facility Energy Efficiency Review
The Facility Energy Efficiency Review is a detailed review of proposed designs for new facilities built in Nunavut. The primary objective of the review is to ensure that each building is designed to include cost effective measures that reduce energy consumption and costs. In this way we also ensure that we minimize the impact on our fragile environment.
Each design is reviewed with the Government of Nunavut Good Building Practices Guideline, which includes descriptions of time tested construction methods used in Nunavut. This document now includes a new energy section that will be employed to ensure that all reasonable efforts are made to reduce the energy consumption of new buildings.
Green Lease
The Government of Nunavut leases a number of buildings from the private sector. At present there is little or no incentive for the property managers to reduce energy consumption. The Government of Nunavut is investigating ways to modify the existing leases in order to encourage the adoption of energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies.
Save 10
SAVE 10 is two-pronged education program designed to train building managers in operating newly retrofitted facilities and to help employees and building occupants (including students) reduce their energy and water consumption at work, at home and at school. It is called SAVE 10 because employees and students can reduce their individual consumption of resources by 10% making small changes in their daily routines. These small changes add up quickly and most importantly, reduce greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change—a serious threat to our land. . You are here

COVID-19 GN Update - November 27, 2020
Minister of Economic Development and Transportation Update:
During the March lockdown my Department began a targeted initiative to assist artists, tourism operators, retailers and other small Nunavut businesses that have been adversely affected by the Covid-19 pandemic.
That initiative continues to provide up to $5,000 in Small Business Support Program funding to assist eligible businesses with minor working capital costs or extraordinary costs which, if not provided, may threaten the continued viability of the business or organization. Eligible operational costs include but are not limited to: rent, insurance coverage, WSCC coverage, license & permit fees, heating, power, phone, internet and other operating costs. The Department is not able to provide compensation for lost income or revenue.
These low-barrier contributions serve to back-stop Nunavut business, enabling them to meet short-term needs while adapting offerings or funding models.
This initiative has seen significant uptake; between launch and mid-November the first intake of applications provided a total of $439,834.75 in relief funding to 106 Nunavut business.
I’m here today to announce a second intake to this initiative. Once they have completing reporting on their first contributions, Small Nunavut Businesses can now access a second round of contributions up to $5,000. As a government we are committed to supporting self-reliance and local employment; Nunavut’s small businesses are an important part of our economy.
As before, to apply for the funding assistance, applicants simply need to complete and submit a short two-page application form and provide a basic explanation of how the business has been affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. My Department has also developed a one-page fillable form to assist applicants in calculating what their business-related working capital costs are, such as: rent, insurance coverage, WSCC coverage, license & permit fees, heating, power and other operating costs. This information as well as detailed regional contact details are available at gov.nu.ca/sbsp.

Minister of Economic Development and Transportation update:
As part of the recovery and resiliency plan for Tourism and Cultural Industries, I'm pleased to announce the launch of ShopNunavut.ca, a platform highlighting local products, services, and experiences that are available to Nunavummiut.
Developed in partnership with Destination Nunavut, Travel Nunavut and Nunavut Economic Development Association, ShopNunavut.ca aims to help Nunavut's small business and tourism community through the COVID-19 pandemic, by providing a one-stop shop for all the various products and services available in the territory. The platform will be active until the end of 2020.

Also on ShopNunavut.ca, Nunavummiut will have access to an exciting new website developed by Travel Nunavut. StaycationNunavut.ca provides up-to-date trip-planning resources and information on what tourism opportunities exist throughout the territory. The website will also provide a space for Nunavut's tourism operators to showcase and advertise new packages and offerings explicitly tailored to local and Northern audiences.
On behalf of the Department of Economic Development and Transportation and our partners, Destination Nunavut, Travel Nunavut, and Nunavut’s Economic Development Association, I encourage all residents to take advantage of this opportunity and use ShopNunavut.ca to buy local, eat local and take part in the local tourism activities that are available.
I invite you to participate in the weekly contests starting July 27 which will be available on ShopNunavut Facebook page and Instagram. The challenges will vary each week and prizes will be awarded in each community.
Go out on the land with local experts and learn about Inuit culture. Discover all the wildlife and beautiful landscapes our unique territory has to offer. Purchase locally harvested country foods and support local artists by purchasing authentic Nunavut art to enhance your homes, your offices, and your place of business.
Local businesses make our communities more sustainable, play an important role in our economy and keep our culture and tradition alive for all of us to enjoy. ShopNunavut and help our local businesses thrive. Thank you.
Department of Economic Development and Transportation Services Update - May 1, 2020
1,285 non-medical masks have been shipped to Pond Inlet to assist with the GN’s rapid response to the confirmed case of COVID-19 in the community.
The shipment included instructions on the use of the masks – in Nunavut’s official languages.
Masks distribution to essential services staff, first responders, elders, people with health conditions and the public-at-large will be coordinated through the Municipality of Pond Inlet.
In-territory production and distribution capacity has grown to between 2,000 and 3,000 non-medical masks per week.
A total of 20 seamstresses are involved in the project, with additional seamstresses being contracted this week as production is expanded to Rankin Inlet, Taloyoak and Pangnirtung (via Nunavut Development Corporation subsidiaries).
The GN has developed a ‘how to use a mask’ guide, as well as “how to wear a mask guide”. Both are available on the GN website in all official languages at https://gov.nu.ca/health/information/covid-19-novel-coronavirus

Department of Economic Development and Transportation Services Update - April 29, 2020
As announced on April 22, the Department of Economic Development and Transportation (EDT) is working jointly with Nunavut Development Corporation (NDC) to produce non-medical masks for public use. This represents an initial investment of $35,000.
The Government of Nunavut’s production of non-medical mask is ongoing; to date over 2,000 masks have been produced by local seamstresses.
The goal of this initiative is to provide a steady supply of masks that will allow Nunavut to comply with the latest Transport Canada requirements for travellers, as well as ensure specific groups such as non-medical front line staff, Elders, and Nunavummiut with pre-existing health conditions can use masks as an additional layer of protection.
A simple guide on how to make a washable non-medical mask can be found in all languages at: https://gov.nu.ca/health/information/covid-19-novel-coronavirus. The guide is based on the Government of Canada’s suggested mask pattern.
The Department of Economic Development and Transportation has also developed a guide on how to use the masks that are being produced by the Government of Nunavut. Instructions in all languages can be found at: https://gov.nu.ca/health/information/covid-19-novel-coronavirus. This guide will also be distributed with every shipment of masks to communities.
Please remember that non-medical masks provide additional protection. They do not replace social distancing and other protective measures.

The masks are made of cotton, are washable, re-usable and are made according to national standards and guidelines. Kits will be sent to seamstresses with production guidelines and directions.
Simple how-to instructions are being developed so people can sew their own masks at home.
Non-medical masks provide additional protection. They do not replace social distancing and other protective measures.
WHAT IS AN APPROPRIATE NON-MEDICAL MASK OR FACE COVERING?
Non-medical face masks or face coverings should:
- be made of at least two layers of tightly woven material fabric (such as cotton or linen)
- be large enough to completely and comfortably cover the nose and mouth without gaping
- fit securely to the head with ties or ear loops
- allow for easy breathing
- be comfortable and not require frequent adjustment
- be changed as soon as possible if damp or dirty
- maintain their shape after washing and drying
Some masks also include a pocket to accommodate a paper towel or disposable coffee filter, for increased benefit. If possible, use different fabrics for each side of the mask, so you know which side faces your mouth and which side is out.
Non-medical masks or face coverings:
- should not be placed on children under the age of two years
- should not be placed on anyone unable to remove them without assistance or anyone who has trouble breathing
- should not be made of plastic or other non-breathable materials
- should not be made exclusively of materials that easily fall apart, such as tissues
- should not be secured with tape or other inappropriate materials
- should not be shared with others
- should not impair vision or interfere with tasks
HOW TO PUT ON A NON-MEDICAL MASK OR FACE COVERING
- Ensure the face covering is clean and dry.
- Wash your hands with warm water and soap for at least 20 seconds before touching the mask. If none is available, use hand sanitizer with a minimum 60% alcohol base.
- Ensure your hair is away from your face.
- Place the face covering over your nose and mouth and secure to your head or ears with its ties or elastics.
- Adjust if needed to ensure nose and mouth are fully covered.
- The mask should fit snugly to the cheeks and there should not be any gaps.
- Repeat Step 2.
While wearing a non-medical mask or face covering, it is important to avoid touching your face. If you do touch your mask or face, you should immediately wash your hands with warm water and soap for at least 20 seconds. You can also use hand sanitizer with a minimum 60% alcohol base.
HOW TO REMOVE A NON-MEDICAL MASK OR FACE COVERING

COVID-19 GN Update - November 27, 2020
Minister of Economic Development and Transportation Update:
During the March lockdown my Department began a targeted initiative to assist artists, tourism operators, retailers and other small Nunavut businesses that have been adversely affected by the Covid-19 pandemic.
That initiative continues to provide up to $5,000 in Small Business Support Program funding to assist eligible businesses with minor working capital costs or extraordinary costs which, if not provided, may threaten the continued viability of the business or organization. Eligible operational costs include but are not limited to: rent, insurance coverage, WSCC coverage, license & permit fees, heating, power, phone, internet and other operating costs. The Department is not able to provide compensation for lost income or revenue.
These low-barrier contributions serve to back-stop Nunavut business, enabling them to meet short-term needs while adapting offerings or funding models.
This initiative has seen significant uptake; between launch and mid-November the first intake of applications provided a total of $439,834.75 in relief funding to 106 Nunavut business.
I’m here today to announce a second intake to this initiative. Once they have completing reporting on their first contributions, Small Nunavut Businesses can now access a second round of contributions up to $5,000. As a government we are committed to supporting self-reliance and local employment; Nunavut’s small businesses are an important part of our economy.
As before, to apply for the funding assistance, applicants simply need to complete and submit a short two-page application form and provide a basic explanation of how the business has been affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. My Department has also developed a one-page fillable form to assist applicants in calculating what their business-related working capital costs are, such as: rent, insurance coverage, WSCC coverage, license & permit fees, heating, power and other operating costs. This information as well as detailed regional contact details are available at gov.nu.ca/sbsp.

Department of Economic Development and Transportation Services Update - May 1, 2020
1,285 non-medical masks have been shipped to Pond Inlet to assist with the GN’s rapid response to the confirmed case of COVID-19 in the community.
The shipment included instructions on the use of the masks – in Nunavut’s official languages.
Masks distribution to essential services staff, first responders, elders, people with health conditions and the public-at-large will be coordinated through the Municipality of Pond Inlet.
In-territory production and distribution capacity has grown to between 2,000 and 3,000 non-medical masks per week.
A total of 20 seamstresses are involved in the project, with additional seamstresses being contracted this week as production is expanded to Rankin Inlet, Taloyoak and Pangnirtung (via Nunavut Development Corporation subsidiaries).
The GN has developed a ‘how to use a mask’ guide, as well as “how to wear a mask guide”. Both are available on the GN website in all official languages at https://gov.nu.ca/health/information/covid-19-novel-coronavirus
Department of Economic Development and Transportation Services Update - April 30, 2020
Community Operations Office in Pond Inlet remains closed. For inquiries please write to CEDO@pondinlet.ca
Department of Economic Development and Transportation Services Update - April 29, 2020
As announced on April 22, the Department of Economic Development and Transportation (EDT) is working jointly with Nunavut Development Corporation (NDC) to produce non-medical masks for public use. This represents an initial investment of $35,000.
The Government of Nunavut’s production of non-medical mask is ongoing; to date over 2,000 masks have been produced by local seamstresses.
The goal of this initiative is to provide a steady supply of masks that will allow Nunavut to comply with the latest Transport Canada requirements for travellers, as well as ensure specific groups such as non-medical front line staff, Elders, and Nunavummiut with pre-existing health conditions can use masks as an additional layer of protection.
A simple guide on how to make a washable non-medical mask can be found in all languages at: https://gov.nu.ca/health/information/covid-19-novel-coronavirus. The guide is based on the Government of Canada’s suggested mask pattern.
The Department of Economic Development and Transportation has also developed a guide on how to use the masks that are being produced by the Government of Nunavut. Instructions in all languages can be found at: https://gov.nu.ca/health/information/covid-19-novel-coronavirus. This guide will also be distributed with every shipment of masks to communities.
Please remember that non-medical masks provide additional protection. They do not replace social distancing and other protective measures.

- fit securely to the head with ties or ear loops
- allow for easy breathing
- be comfortable and not require frequent adjustment
- be changed as soon as possible if damp or dirty
- maintain their shape after washing and drying
Some masks also include a pocket to accommodate a paper towel or disposable coffee filter, for increased benefit. If possible, use different fabrics for each side of the mask, so you know which side faces your mouth and which side is out.
Non-medical masks or face coverings:
- should not be placed on children under the age of two years

worldatlas,https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/what-is-the-climate-and-landscape-of-nunavut-like.html ,"5. Description
Nunavut is the newest territory of Canada, receiving its current status of recognition as a Canadian territory separate from the Northwest Territories in 1999. It is a well-known natural paradise, with a stunning landscape and vast stretches of absolute wilderness. It is a famous tourism destination to those people who love adventurous activities like canoeing, fishing, hiking, kayaking, and much more. The territory has a very low population density, with approximately 33,000 people in an area of 2,093,190 square kilometers. Nunavut has three distinct regions, namely Qikiqtaaluk, Kivalliq, and Kitikmeot. The winters are usually cold and windy, with the temperatures dropping as far as -40 degrees Celsius. Thermometers in Nunavut are seen rising up to as high as 30 degrees Celsius in the summertime.
4. Historical Role
The human history of the Nunavut region dates back to 4,000 years ago, when a prehistoric tribe named the Tuniit arrived in Nunavut, and quickly became the dominant inhabitants of the entire region with their expertise in using bows and arrows. Their weapons and tools used for building their tents were very similar to those of the Northern Siberian peoples. Around 1,000 years ago, Inuit people with advanced knowledge of maritime hunting skills spread rapidly into Nunavut, and displaced the Tuniits in the process. These people quickly adapted to the harsh and isolated life of the arctic environment, which speaks a lot about their sheer determination and physical strength. Their culture has remained integral in the region into the 21st Century.
3. Modern Significance
Vast reserves of gold, uranium, diamond, copper, silver, zinc, and iron ores have been discovered in Nunavut over the more recent years. This has made the entire territory of Nunavut extremely economically attractive, despite hurdles in transportation and mining. This wealth of natural resources has offered Nunavut a much-needed significance in the modern times. Moreover, its excellent location near the North Pole has offered an excellent base for Arctic scientific exploration. With snow melting rapidly due to global warming, there is also an increased possibility for ship vessels having increased ease of access to a true ""northwest passage"" (i.e. an Arctic sea route to the Pacific Ocean).
2. Habitat and Biodiversity
Inuits have been the primary human inhabitants of Nunavut throughout the past several centuries. In spite of an arrival of Europeans and Americans, a majority of the population is still constituted these native peoples. Nunavut has a low biodiversity owing to the extremely cold climes. However, one can spot Tundra wolves, Ringed seals, Bearded seals, walruses, Killer whales, Beluga whales, and Polar bears living here. The place also has a diversity inclusive of more than 180 marine fishes, such as the Northern Wolfish, Greenland Halibuts, Four-horn Sculpins, Capalins, and Arctic stakes.
1. Environmental Threats and Territorial Disputes
Nunavut is currently experiencing a huge environmental threat due to rising global temperatures. This warming effect is disrupting the ages-old lifestyles of the native peoples. Furthermore, the decreasing sizes of the region's ice sheets are allowing vessels to explore the Northwest Passage, which means increased dangers of oil spills into the Arctic waters, with the potential of destroying marine fishes and wildlife throughout the region. Other activities, like mining, are also posing an increasing environmental threat. However, the Inuits' territorial disputes have largely been resolved, with Nunavut becoming a Canadian territory in 1999 after a longstanding demand among its inhabitants for their separation from the Northwest Territories. .

ejatlas,https://www.ejatlas.org/conflict/iron-ore-nunavut-canada ,"In Baffin island, the Inuit council agree to iron ore extraction (about 6 million tons per year) against the recommendations of the Nunavut Impact Review Board. Meanwhile, building of a railway is in dispute.
Nunavut is the largest in area and the second-least populous of Canada's provinces and territories. It is becoming a ""commodity extraction frontier"", with uranium and iron ore resources. One of the world's most remote, sparsely settled regions, it has a population of 36,000, mostly Inuit, spread over an area of just over 1,750,000 km2.

Nunavut is Canada’s last frontier for mineral exploration. It rivals the size of Western Europe and hosts some of the largest undeveloped gold resources.
The expansive territory of Nunavut rivals the size of Western Europe, and hosts some of the largest undeveloped gold resources in Canada. As well, modern exploration techniques in gold mining in Nunavut have led to the discovery of new gold camps across the territory.
Two of those discoveries are now producing gold mines: Agnico Eagle Mines’ (TSX:ASM,NYSE:AEM) Meadowbank, and most recently the Doris gold mine at TMAC Resources’ (TSX:TMR) Hope Bay project. In 2019, Agnico Eagle plans to commence production at two new mines in the resource-rich Kivalliq region — Amaruk, a satellite deposit to the north of Meadowbank, and Meliadine, which has proven and probable reserves of 14.5 million tonnes at 7.32 g/t gold.
“Agnico Eagle has paved the way to proving gold mines can be very profitable in Nunavut,” said Chris Pennimpede, operations manager at CSA Global, one of the mining industry’s top consultancy firms.
Gold mining in Nunavut: Explorers are unlocking value
The low cost of entry and high potential for discovery and expansion in a mining-friendly jurisdiction is highly appealing for junior resource companies. Although Nunavut is considered a frontier district, previously explored properties with valuable data and existing infrastructure are available for those companies looking for attractive acquisition targets.
Cache Exploration‘s (TSXV:CAY) purchase of Kiyuk Lake project (Kivalliq region) and Kivalliq Energy’s (TSXV:KIV) pick up of the Baffin gold project (Qikiqtani region) are prime examples.
Cache Exploration’s Kiyuk Lake project has the potential to be a new district play in the Kivalliq region. Covering the majority of the Proterozoic Kiyuk Basin, the early stage property has been explored intermittently since 1992 by various companies, including Comaplex Minerals, Newmont Mining (NYSE:NEM) and Prosperity Goldfields.
Cache’s acquisition of the project in early 2017 included a 12,000-meter drill database (2008 to 2013), a fully functioning mining camp already on site and sufficient fuel for a large drill program.
The large 590-square-kilometer Kiyuk Lake claim block hosts numerous intrusion-related gold showings over a 15-kilometer strike length that remains largely untested by drilling. Four distinct mineralized zones with significant expansion potential have been identified at Kiyuk Lake. The exploration data on the property shows multiple gold intercepts of over 3 g/t gold.
Cache is looking to leverage the property’s 12,000-meter database toward potential new discoveries at Kiyuk Lake. Its most recent exploration program was aimed at expanding the known gold mineralization at the Rusty and Gold Point zones through drilling and identifying new mineralized zones through grid till sampling and prospecting. So far, five new additional target areas have been identified and are ready for drilling.
Located in one of the largest undeveloped greenstone-iron formation gold belts in the territory (the Foxe Gold Belt), the Baffin gold project covers a mineralized gold system hosting known high-grade gold occurrences in multiple geological settings, with structural similarities to Meadowbank. In 2017, Kivalliq Energy cut a deal with Commander Resources (TSXV:CMD), adding the nearly 409,000-hectare Baffin gold property to its Nunavut portfolio, which includes two quality uranium properties, Angilak and Baker Basin.
The over $25 million worth of exploration and geoscience databases that came with the property were an attractive feature for Kivalliq. Those databases include work conducted by BHP Billiton (ASX:BHP,LSE:BLT,NYSE:BHP), Falconbridge, AngloGold Ashanti (NYSE:AU) and Commander Resources between 2001 and 2011. “Our team will benefit greatly from the significant exploration expenditures from previous operators, which generated extremely high-grade gold numbers at exploration targets that also exhibited potential for significant size and scale,” said Kivalliq Energy CEO Jim Paterson.
The existing infrastructure at Baffin (including a camp and two 1,200-meter DEW Line airstrips), along with 15 prospecting permits and a mineral exploration agreement with Nunavut Tunngavik already in place, will help Kivalliq rapidly advance exploration and the potential development of the project.
Gold mining in Nunavut: Potential for new discoveries
“Until recently, Nunavut remained untouched by modern gold exploration, leaving much of the territory relatively unexplored compared to more mature provinces such as Ontario, Quebec and BC,” explained Pennimpede.
Many new discoveries have been made over the last few years, including those by Nord Gold (FWB:RTSD) at Pistol Bay, Auryn Resources (TSX:AUG,NYSEMKT:AUG) at Committee Bay and Dunnedin Ventures‘ (TSXV:DVI) recent gold discovery at Kahuna in the Kivalliq region.
The 380,000-hectare Committee Bay gold project is situated along the Committee Bay Greenstone Belt, about 180 kilometers northeast of the Meadowbank mine. Auryn has identified 17 high-priority targets along the belt. The project hosts the Three Bluffs gold deposit with an indicated resource of 524,000 ounces grading 7.85 g/t gold and an inferred resource of 720,000 ounces grading 7.64 g/t gold.
During its 2015 exploration program at the high-grade diamond Kahuna project, Dunnedin made a unique discovery of gold adjacent to the project’s diamond-bearing kimberlites. Four gold belts, including the Kannuqa Belt, have been identified on the 120,000-hectare property, which is surrounded by Agnico Eagle’s Meliadine gold mine to the north, west and south.
Gold mining in Nunavut: Boosting local economy
The gold-mining industry is fueling a period of economic prosperity and investment in Nunavut. The territory’s first gold mine, Meadowbank, began production in 2010, breathing new life into the economy. In 2017, Meadowbank produced approximately 320,000 ounces of gold. The mine represents 15 percent of Nunavut’s GDP, has 300 Inuit employees and generates $280 million in local business procurement each year, according to Pierre Graton, president and CEO of the Mining Association of Canada. Agnico Eagle recently announced plans to spend $1.6 billion on the development of its projects in the Kivalliq region over the next three years.
Speaking at the 20th annual Nunavut Mining Symposium in April 2017, Nunavut’s senior economist, Francois Picotte, called Agnico Eagle’s Meliadine a “game changer” for the territory. Picotte projects that mining production in Nunavut will reach $1.5 billion by 2020 — double the figure for 2016.
Gold mining in Nunavut: The newest gold mine
Taking notice of Agnico Eagle’s success, other major and mid-tier miners have gained a foothold in the territory. Glencore’s (LSE:GLEN) acquisition of the Hackett River silver–zinc project, Nord Gold’s purchase of the Pistol Bay gold project (Kivalliq region) and TMAC Resources’ acquisition of the Hope Bay gold project are notable examples.
TMAC Resources acquired the now-producing Hope Bay in 2013 from a wholly owned subsidiary of Newmont Mining. Named after the Hope Bay Greenstone Belt in which it lies, the project has a historical database dating back to work conducted by BHP in 1988. Impact and benefit agreements with the Kitikmeot Inuit Association were in place under Newmont. The property also benefited from existing infrastructure, which allowed development of the project to progress quickly with the addition of a mill.
The first operating mine in the Kitikmeot region in more than a decade, TMAC’s Doris mine at Hope Bay reached commercial production in May 2017. The company expects to commence production at the project’s other two deposits, Madrid and Boston, in 2020 and 2022, respectively. Hope Bay has total proven and probable reserves of 14.2 million tonnes grading 7.7 g/t gold.
Gold mining in Nunavut: Strongly supportive government and Inuit associations
Infrastructure does pose a challenge for miners working in this Arctic region, said Pennimpede, who is also a member of Cache Exploration’s board of directors and a geologist well experienced with mineral exploration in Nunavut, Yukon and Alaska. “However, Agnico Eagle and TMAC Resources have proven mining can be profitable with limited infrastructure by using winter roads, ice runways and eventually building roads to support operations. Importantly, all of these activities have been supported by local communities and government.”
The government of Nunavut and the Kitikmeot Inuit Association are partnering on a proposed project to build the longest road in Nunavut. The Grays Bay road and port project will be a 227-kilometer all-season road that will connect a proposed deepwater port at Grays Bay (located along the Northwest Passage route) to the winter road that services the Northwest Territories’ diamond mines. The road will be a boon to the region’s current producing and exploration projects. In the future, the Grays Bay road could become a transportation link to Yellowknife and other regions of Canada.
Producers and explorers alike clearly see Nunavut as a safe jurisdiction in which to invest, and both the territorial and local governments are strongly supportive. “Compared to other provinces and territories,” added Pennimpede, “Nunavut is supporting development at an exceptional rate, recognizing the benefit it brings to the region while still holding companies accountable to a high standard of community and environmental consultation and regulation.”

mongabay,https://news.mongabay.com/2020/10/with-the-help-of-an-app-nunavut-hunters-document-the-changing-arctic/ https://news.mongabay.com/2020/10/with-the-help-of-an-app-nunavut-hunters-document-the-changing-arctic/ ,"- Since 2012, the Nunavut Wildlife Management Board (NWMB) has run a community-based monitoring program to gather information about Inuit harvesting practices and the status of regional species.
- The program recently introduced an app that makes it possible for anyone to participate in the program, at any time.
- Like other community-based monitoring programs, the primary challenge for the NWMB is figuring out how to use information that is different from traditional scientific or social science research.
It’s fall in Nunavut, Canada, and Richard Kakk is hunting caribou. Snow that started in September has placed him in a landscape of white, broken only by the ice-crusted slate blue of the Gulf of Boothia to the west, the patches of exposed black rock in the rolling hills to the east, and the brown splotches of the caribou herd up ahead. Though temperatures are nowhere near the winter lows of -30° Celsius (-22° Fahrenheit), it’s no place to tarry, particularly if a polar bear should show up interested in his kill.
Even so, after Kakk harvests a caribou, the full-time hunter from the community of Kugaaruk stops to take his phone from his bag. With a few taps, he records how many caribou he saw in the herd, how many males and how many females, and whether the herd looked healthy. When he returns home, he’ll upload this information to a database owned wholly by his community. There, Kakk’s data can help guide important management decisions about Nunavut’s diverse wildlife.
“These harvesters are generating knowledge that is impossible to obtain from science or social science research alone,” said Denis Ndeloh Etiendem, director of wildlife management at the Nunavut Wildlife Management Board (NWMB). Ndeloh Etiendem co-authored a recent paper in the journal Arctic Science about the program’s first eight years of operation.
This community-based wildlife monitoring project, an effort of the NWMB, occupies a unique place at several crossroads: of modern technology and traditional practices; of bureaucracy and self-governance; and of Western science and Indigenous knowledge. These are crossroads that are not always simple to navigate, and sometimes conflicting. But according to program managers, the program offers tremendous potential.
For much of the program’s run, participating harvesters have used weatherproof handheld tablets to document their field observations. While hardy, these tablets are also expensive, the high cost limiting the program’s scope to just three communities over a three-year monitoring period.
This year, the NWMB reconfigured the tablet app to run on any Android phone. While simple, this technological change could vastly expand the program’s information-gathering potential.
Kakk and other program participants told Mongabay that the new app has made it significantly easier to record observations. Ndeloh Etiendem said that the app will ideally let them operate the community-based monitoring constantly across the territory, with no time limit to how long participants can log information.
“More importantly, this information is owned by the community,” he added. “They can make their own decisions using the eyes of their own harvesters, in real time. They don’t have to apply to the government for data for information about a study that happened three years ago and wait for the bureaucratic process to come around.”
The NWMB launched the community-based monitoring program in January 2012. It aims to both document Inuit harvesting practices and gather baseline wildlife data that has long been impossible for scientists to collect. Nunavut’s harsh weather has typically limited scientists’ data-gathering to the short summer, and the largely remote territory covers a massive area: its land and water combined stretch more than 2 million square kilometers (772,000 square miles), equivalent to nearly four-and-a-half Californias.
Over the program’s eight years, it collected 8,187 records documenting 36 species across the territory. These records include whether animals appeared sick or healthy. They also include important logistical data, such as how hunters are traveling and the routes they follow across changing sea ice — both of which can demonstrate how communities are adapting to climate change. Already, the data has informed local management decisions, including weighing the risk of the Whale Tale mine to caribou harvesting. The mine opened in 2019.
“It’s helped me reflect on what the harvest habits are, and notice how the animals migrate or move,” said Lars Qaqqaq, a hunter and trapper from Baker Lake who has volunteered with the community monitoring program since 2018. It’s also drawn Qaqqaq’s attention to wildlife shifting north, which he believes is due to climate change.
“Like, 20 or 30 years ago we didn’t have all these wolverines, or grizzly bears. Last week someone caught a beaver here, even though we’re at least 150 to 200 miles [240 to 320 kilometers] away from any trees,” Qaqqaq said.
However, the program also presents its own challenges. The information from the hunters doesn’t fit the requirements of scientific data. This data isn’t randomized, and hunters collect it on targeted hunting routes. As a result, it’s not considered representative sampling. Yet the data also doesn’t fit the characteristics of participatory Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit (IQ) research, the social science study of Inuit traditional knowledge.
“Looking at just the words of the Nunavut Agreement, you have to bring in science and Inuit knowledge,” Ndeloh Etiendem said, referring to the document that established Nunavut Territory in 1993. This founding document expressly recognizes the Inuit people’s legal rights to harvest wildlife, and mandates that management decisions use both scientific knowledge and IQ. “So, where does this new knowledge from the community fit?”
Heather Ashthorn, administrative coordinator of the Arctic Borderlands Ecological Knowledge Society, says she’s faced the same challenge in the Borderlands’ co-op community monitoring program. This program gathers data about the Porcupine Caribou Herd, which ranges across eastern Alaska and northern Yukon.
“It is difficult to know how to use [this data], and it is politically fraught to try and give weight to local knowledge versus scientific,” Ashthorn said. “What happens, for example, when people say there’s tons of caribou but a model says there aren’t? Who gets the most weight?”
Rebecca Jeppesen, the community liaison and project manager of the NWMB, said in an email that she felt a mismatch between local information and scientific studies often occurred because they were working on different spatial or temporal scales.
Yet experts from both programs emphasized that there was unique value to community monitoring data. At the minimum, Ndeloh Etiendem suggested that this information could offer a jumping-off point to inspire more structured scientific surveys.
Ashthorn added that this data can help tell a story, describing the world with greater depth and insight.
“If we keep wanting local knowledge and perspective to look like scientific data, we’re going to keep beating our heads against the same brick wall, because the strength of it is that it doesn’t,” she said. “Where science can’t really gather enough data or can’t really understand how changes are affecting a community, that’s where local knowledge can step in. But it’s not going to always look like a one or zero.”
Instead, she said, scientists and policymakers who want access to local knowledge should have the “patience and tolerance and willingness to think outside the box” in using these databases.
The good news is the Nunavut Wildlife Management Board is committed to maintaining and expanding the program, including finding new ways for the board to use community knowledge.
Ndeloh Etiendem’s goal is to create a “digital footprint” of current Inuit harvesting that can inform generations to come.
“If you really want to know what is happening and how people adapt to changes, especially in the Arctic where changes are very rapid, you have to be there for a long time,” he said. “Programs like community-based monitoring allow us to be here for the long term.”
Qaqqaq said that he hopes this long-term monitoring will inspire investigations into big-picture patterns and changes that most people, including non-hunters living in Nunavut, don’t notice. After all, climate change is warming the Arctic two times faster than any other habitat on Earth. There may be no better way to see these changes than through the eyes of those who use, hunt, and live within this landscape every day.

Ndeloh Etiendem said that the app will ideally let them operate the community-based monitoring constantly across the territory, with no time limit to how long participants can log information.
“More importantly, this information is owned by the community,” he added. “They can make their own decisions using the eyes of their own harvesters, in real time. They don’t have to apply to the government for data for information about a study that happened three years ago and wait for the bureaucratic process to come around.”
The NWMB launched the community-based monitoring program in January 2012. It aims to both document Inuit harvesting practices and gather baseline wildlife data that has long been impossible for scientists to collect. Nunavut’s harsh weather has typically limited scientists’ data-gathering to the short summer, and the largely remote territory covers a massive area: its land and water combined stretch more than 2 million square kilometers (772,000 square miles), equivalent to nearly four-and-a-half Californias.
Over the program’s eight years, it collected 8,187 records documenting 36 species across the territory. These records include whether animals appeared sick or healthy. They also include important logistical data, such as how hunters are traveling and the routes they follow across changing sea ice — both of which can demonstrate how communities are adapting to climate change. Already, the data has informed local management decisions, including weighing the risk of the Whale Tale mine to caribou harvesting. The mine opened in 2019.
“It’s helped me reflect on what the harvest habits are, and notice how the animals migrate or move,” said Lars Qaqqaq, a hunter and trapper from Baker Lake who has volunteered with the community monitoring program since 2018. It’s also drawn Qaqqaq’s attention to wildlife shifting north, which he believes is due to climate change.
“Like, 20 or 30 years ago we didn’t have all these wolverines, or grizzly bears. Last week someone caught a beaver here, even though we’re at least 150 to 200 miles [240 to 320 kilometers] away from any trees,” Qaqqaq said.
However, the program also presents its own challenges. The information from the hunters doesn’t fit the requirements of scientific data. This data isn’t randomized, and hunters collect it on targeted hunting routes. As a result, it’s not considered representative sampling. Yet the data also doesn’t fit the characteristics of participatory Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit (IQ) research, the social science study of Inuit traditional knowledge.
“Looking at just the words of the Nunavut Agreement, you have to bring in science and Inuit knowledge,” Ndeloh Etiendem said, referring to the document that established Nunavut Territory in 1993. This founding document expressly recognizes the Inuit people’s legal rights to harvest wildlife, and mandates that management decisions use both scientific knowledge and IQ. “So, where does this new knowledge from the community fit?”
Heather Ashthorn, administrative coordinator of the Arctic Borderlands Ecological Knowledge Society, says she’s faced the same challenge in the Borderlands’ co-op community monitoring program. This program gathers data about the Porcupine Caribou Herd, which ranges across eastern Alaska and northern Yukon.
“It is difficult to know how to use [this data], and it is politically fraught to try and give weight to local knowledge versus scientific,” Ashthorn said. “What happens, for example, when people say there’s tons of caribou but a model says there aren’t? Who gets the most weight?”
Rebecca Jeppesen, the community liaison and project manager of the NWMB, said in an email that she felt a mismatch between local information and scientific studies often occurred because they were working on different spatial or temporal scales.
Yet experts from both programs emphasized that there was unique value to community monitoring data. At the minimum, Ndeloh Etiendem suggested that this information could offer a jumping-off point to inspire more structured scientific surveys.
Ashthorn added that this data can help tell a story, describing the world with greater depth and insight.
“If we keep wanting local knowledge and perspective to look like scientific data, we’re going to keep beating our heads against the same brick wall, because the strength of it is that it doesn’t,” she said. “Where science can’t really gather enough data or can’t really understand how changes are affecting a community, that’s where local knowledge can step in. But it’s not going to always look like a one or zero.”
Instead, she said, scientists and policymakers who want access to local knowledge should have the “patience and tolerance and willingness to think outside the box” in using these databases.
The good news is the Nunavut Wildlife Management Board is committed to maintaining and expanding the program, including finding new ways for the board to use community knowledge.
Ndeloh Etiendem’s goal is to create a “digital footprint” of current Inuit harvesting that can inform generations to come.
“If you really want to know what is happening and how people adapt to changes, especially in the Arctic where changes are very rapid, you have to be there for a long time,” he said. “Programs like community-based monitoring allow us to be here for the long term.”
Qaqqaq said that he hopes this long-term monitoring will inspire investigations into big-picture patterns and changes that most people, including non-hunters living in Nunavut, don’t notice. After all, climate change is warming the Arctic two times faster than any other habitat on Earth. There may be no better way to see these changes than through the eyes of those who use, hunt, and live within this landscape every day.

Nunavut
People have inhabited the Canadian Arctic continuously for the past 4,000 years - in fact the Arctic was the last habitable region of the world to be occupied by people. The people of the Dorset, Thule and Inuit cultures were innovative and learned how to use the limited arctic resources to become self-sufficient. For thousands of years the Inuit and their ancestors made their own clothes, built houses, hunted, fished, and raised their families. They also supplied their own health care, recreation and education, and used dog-teams to travel great distances. When European explorers came to the Arctic looking for a Northwest Passage in the 1570's, they interacted with some Inuit villages, but did not significantly impact the Inuit lifestyle. It was during the 1800's when the whaling industry moved to the Arctic, that the Inuit lifestyle began to change. The whalers, and later on merchants and fur traders, brought new tools and technology to the Inuit, as well as devastating diseases which wiped out entire camps. Inuit life is very different in the Canadian Arctic today. The advent of satellite technology has had a profound effect on isolated Inuit Arctic communities. While strong traditional values and ethics are woven into the fabric of many Nunavut communities, Inuit are now adapting and using home computers, telephones, cable TV and the Internet.

Transportation
For generations the Inuit people of Nunavut lived a traditional life in the Arctic, moving from one place to another with the seasons, to hunt caribou, muskox and seal, or fish for char and whitefish. Inuit did not wander aimlessly in search of meat and fish. They visited the same seasonal hunting and fishing camps each year to harvest food.
Their lifestyle was semi-nomadic moving three or four times a year. They might catch whatever they could along the way, but they always had a specific destination. Many Inuit groups would spend the winters in snowhouses on the sea ice hunting seals, springtime on the coast catching seals and fish, and summertime inland hunting caribou. In between they would harvest berries, birds eggs, fish for lake trout or cod and use whatever food nature provided.
When the hunting was good, the spring, summer and fall were times to hunt and travel, while the mid-winter was a time to spend with the family, tell stories, play games, and learn about Inuit oral history and Inuit legends.
The Inuit invented various types of transportation to travel in the Arctic. For most of the year the Arctic was a frozen land. The lakes and rivers were frozen, and the Arctic Ocean had 1.5m -2 m of sea ice covering it for 8-9 months each year.
Walking was the most common form of transport in the Arctic. Inuit would pack their children, their hunting tools and everything they needed for the winter and walk perhaps hundreds of kilometers from a summer camp to a winter camp. They often left behind the tools and implements needed for hunting caribou and other summer activities, because they would revisit their summer camp next year, and much of what they needed would remain there.
Coastal Inuit used small boats called kayaks to hunt for walrus and seals, and larger boats for called umiaks to hunt larger prey such as beluga and bowhead whales. The boat frame was sometimes made with driftwood or caribou antler and sealskin or walrus hide was used to cover the frame. Different Inuit groups used different types of kayak and umiak depending on the materials available and the prey being hunted.
Today most Inuit use snowmobiles to travel on the land. For 8-9 months of the year there is sufficient snow on the land and ice on the frozen ocean and lakes to make snowmobile travel practicable. During the 3-4 months of summer, many Inuit use ATV. The trade names of ""Ski-Doo"" and ""Honda"" are used interchangeably to refer to a snowmobile or ATV.
Inter-community travel is usually by airplane. Aircraft are the vital link connecting many communities. They transport passengers, mail, supplies and groceries all year, weather permitting.
Some Inuit still maintain dog-teams, and many commercial sportshunts have to be conducted by dog-team to ensure a traditional and equitable challenge. Many people also use a boat and motor during the brief summer period when the ocean is free of ice. The ubiquitous 18' open boat with a 50hp outboard motor is a common sight in many Nunavut communities, althought for 9-10 months of the year the boat is unusable due to winter conditions.

The traditional life - economy
The climate dictated when and where they would move. An early spring meant the caribou could migrate early. A late spring and cold summer meant the caribou might be late or change their migratory route altogether. Tradtionally caribou would be hunted at a river crossing or from a caribou blind. Using bow and arrow or spears the Inuit hunter had to get close to the caribou for a successful hunt.
When caribou migrated in large herds, sometimes hundreds of thousands they were easier to catch, and so timing was important. The Inuit camp had to be established and ready for the caribou migrations coming North in the spring and South in the fall. If they missed a fall harvest the camp might go hungry or even starve during the winter.
When an animal was caught, the camp shared the food equally. Sharing and interdependency were traits of the traditional Inuit economy. Within the camp there were different people with different skills. One man might be a good seal hunter, a lady might be a good maker of waterproof footwear, and another may be good at making tools. All these skills were needed for the camp to survive, as well as good navigators, good shamans, and a variety of other skills.
No one individual had all the skills necessary, and the survival of the group was dependent on the skills and abilities of the individuals. Similarly if a hunter were injured, his family would be provided with food and care until he recovered. Camp size was determined by the number of animals (food) in the immediate area, to support that camp. Too many people and not enough food meant the camp would have to split up, with one group moving to a new location. If there were lots of caribou and seal, smaller camps could unite and families could afford to have more children.
Today Inuit still maintain elements of sharing and interdependency in their culture, but life has changed and Nunavut today has adopted a wage economy. The need for income to purchase groceries, pay mortgages, and buy boats, ATV's and Ski-Doos has encouraged many Inuit to take jobs with the Nunavut government and municipal governments. The Canadian dollar has become the medium of exchange. There is still significant sharing when caribou and seal are available, but the population of many Nunavut communities is too large to live off the land. A traditional camp the size of an average Nunavut community would not survive. There are too many people and not enough resources in the local area. The camp would likely have to breakup, the people disperse into smaller camps and spread out over a larger hunting and fishing area. The centralization and urbanization of Canadian Inuit into 28 Nunavut communities has eroded traditional and cultural pursuits and values, but has facilitated the delivery of contemporary education, employment and health care.
|Nunavut Image 82|
The Family: Rules of Kinship
While kinship usually applies to people related either by blood or marriage, the Inuit extended this term to include friends, neighbors and associates. By certain rituals these individuals all became one's relatives.
A common way to unite families in Inuit or any other society is through marriage. Another rite practised in traditional Inuit society was child betrothal; parents customarily pledged their children to a future marriage. This drew the parents of the betrothed children into a kinship alliance, even if the marriage never took place.
Another means by which an individual was made kin was through adoption. Inuit adoption, however, created more than a bond between the adopted child and its new family. It created a link between the new parents and the natural parents. All these new links served to establish bonds of co-operation and trust between previously unrelated people.
Even partnerships, be it wrestling partners or singing or hunting partners, created kinship bonds. The use of namesakes created yet another bond. Naming a child after a recently deceased person meant that the child belonged to two families: the original and that of the namesake.
Today Inuit in most Nunavut communities are closely related. Marriages, extended families and custom adoptions continue to form bonds of kinship. This is not as much a survival mechanism today as it is a vestige of traditional life, and a function of the cultural and geographic landscape.
|Nunavut Image 83|
Child Rearing
In traditional Inuit households, children were treated with patience and gentleness, and in response, children were seldom unruly. Slapping and scolding were not regarded as acceptable forms of child control. Proper behaviour, through, was achieved through other means.
The Inuit considered generosity, mildness and gentleness to be very good traits. Since their society relied on the co-operative effort of all its members, these traits became indispensable. Losing one's temper, on the other hand, was considered disgraceful. Moreover, a rash angry act could threaten the well-being of the community.
Children developed certain traits through a subtle process of social pressure. Negative qualities such as petulance were ridiculed while positive qualities such as unselfishness were rewarded. One of the most severe forms of punishment was withdrawal of affection. In a society that relied on member's cooperation, there was nothing more life threatening than isolation. A child was never denied a wish, although an adult would try to modify a child's unreasonable request. A small child would be allowed to play with a very sharp knife, but quickly someone would distract the infant with affection and another a substitute for the knife. In other circumstances, experience was considered the best teacher. Older children for example quickly learned that knives were very sharp: one good nick usually taught them to be careful.
Today Inuit life is very different. Schools throughout Nunavut teach Canadian curriculum from K-12, with aspects of cultural immersion and inclusion. Inuit children today spend as much time in front of computers and cable television, as children anywhere in Canada. By December, 2000, every Nunavut commmunity will have a local internet server and Inuit children will be connected to the world wide web.
|Nunavut Image 47|
Education
Education took place within the family and the community circle. By constant exposure to their parents and other adults in the community, children learned all they needed to live successfully.
The Inuit of old did not have a written language, so skills and knowledge were passed down by word of mouth. After a successful hunt, for example, the details would be shared with the community. The children, boys in particular, listened to reports of the hunters' latest venture and learned from them. The hunters would describe in detail the location where they spotted the animal. They would give elaborate accounts of the animal's behaviour and how they responded to that behaviour. Besides listening to the hunters' stories, the children enacted their own hunts by watching animals and observing their behaviour. They also tried to stalk animals, which required great patience.
But being patient was part of life and children learned this too. If a family was confined to the igloo because of a storm, children entertained themselves. After all, bad weather or sickness couldn't be controlled: one simply learned to live with it. Waiting was a part of life. Ajurnamat, the people would say: ""it can't be helped."" Another important aspect of children's education was learning to orient themselves in their surroundings. Children learned from an early age to memorize the landscape.
In traditional Inuit society there were no laws as we know them today. Taboos and rituals, however, did restrict behaviour. Fear of criticism and rejection were two strong forces that controlled people's actions. Today Inuit attend elementary schools and high school, and are subject to federal and territorial laws which are administered in every Nunavut community by the RCMP and municipal by-law officers. There are also restrictions and licences required for the handling of firearms and the hunting of animals, monitored by the Nunavut government's renewable resource officers. Many Inuit today can read and write both English and Inuktitut, and much of their oral history has now been written down and documented.
|Nunavut Image 45|
Language
The language of the Inuit (Inuktitut) existed without written form until missionaries went North in the 18th and 19th centuries. But the Inuit possessed more than an oral language. They also maintained a non-verbal language that relied on body expression and other cues to display feelings. So, the Inuit learned to interpret human behaviour in the same manner they read animal behaviour.
Inuktitut today, as in the past, reflects and reinforces the Inuit's culture and value system. Strong emphasis is placed on nature and its elements. There are dozens of words to describe snow, for in the north the weather can produce a wide range of snow conditions, and the quality of snow is of great significance to the Inuit. Only certain types of snow, for example, make good igloos.
In Inuktitut there is no distinction between animate and inanimate objects. But distinction is drawn between things that are named and things that are not. The land, for example, has many names, as does man. Therefore, there is a relationship between the two.
Today many Inuit read and write both English and Inuktitut. Middle aged and elderly Inuit are mainly unilingual in Inuktitut, or speak some English, while the younger Inuit are mainly bi-lingual. English, French, Inuktitut and Innuinuqtun (a dialect of Inuktitut) are the official languages of Nunavut today.
|Nunavut Image 78|
Health
The Inuit were, by and large, a healthy people. Their diet was protein rich and provided all the necessary nutrients. Major problems arose, however, during periodic bouts of starvation that could severely weaken a community and in some cases lead to the death of many members.
In the treatment of common ailments, however, the Inuit relied on the herbs and plants they collected during the summer. They also made use of animal by-products in their healing techniques. Lemming skins were used as bandages and acted as an antiseptic agent. Caribou, seal, or bear fat was used for the same purpose.
With the coming of non-natives to the north, the Inuit were exposed to many diseases. Having little or no immunity to these foreign illnesses, the Inuit died by the hundreds. During the early 1900's Spanish influenza hit the Labrador Inuit and destroyed about one-third of the population. In 1902 the majority of the Southampton Island population was wiped out. By 1910 the MacKenzie Delta Inuit population had dropped drastically.
Today Inuit have health care provided by Nunavut Government. Each Nunavut community has a Health Center, staffed by nurses and community health workers. A doctor and dentist often do a circuit, travelling through 6-7 communities every few months to administer to the ill. Serious injuries are flown to Yellowknife or Iqaluit by regular airplane or on a medi-vac if it is an emergency situation. The medi-vac is usually a Lear jet based in a particular community, and is designated for medical emergencies. Most Inuit receive a high standard of medical treatment today, and attend hospitals for births, etc.
|Nunavut Image 79|
Religion
The life of the Inuit was intimately bound to the natural environment, and in traditional religion this same emphasis was apparent. Religion and spirituality was in the form of nature worship. The unpredictable forces of nature were believed to be controlled by powerful spirits, and it was important to appease these spirits when they had been angered. This responsibility to protect people from spirits fell to the shamans - the Inuit medicine men or women.
The shaman was the intermediary between the human world and the spirit one. When the sea goddess showed her anger by causing storms over the ocean or by witholding the sea mammals it was the shaman's duty to divine what had made her angry and what would appease her. This involved performing certain rituals. It was hoped that once the sea goddess was happy, the animals would become available to the hunters.
It was believed that the shamans possessed magical powers, such as the ability to fly, turn themselves into animals or read people's minds. Good shamans were said to have healing powers and be able to cure illnesses by expelling evil spirits from the body. Evil shamans, however, were capable of murderous acts.
Another traditional Inuit religious belief was that human spirits lived on after people died. The spirit of a deceased person would eventually occupy a newborn who had received the spirit's mortal name. The child, it was believed, would acquire its namesake's soul and abilities.
Today many Inuit follow either the Catholic or Anglican faith. Missionaries from these two denominations came to the Arctic in the early 1900's, bringing medecines, technology and faith. The Inuit were impressed and bought the whole package. Older Inuit still have faith in shamans, and their ideology is a blend of traditional beliefs and modern theology. Many of the missionaries were devout priests and ministers who learned Inuktitut and the Inuit culture and who passionately wanted to make life better for their parishioners.
|Nunavut Image 84|
Recreation
The life of the Inuit was not all hard work. As long as there was plenty of food and no immediate chores to be done, or when a severe winter storm kept everyone house-bound, there was time to indulge in pastimes.
One pastime the Inuit children enjoyed was games. Children spent a lot of time outside playing tag or hide and seek or pretending to hunt. But there were other games for the young and old during the long, dark winter months, when there was little else to do. During winter, families were often restricted to their small igloos. Games served to break the monotony and acted as a release for pent-up energy and emotions. Since it was considered disgraceful to show open hostility, games became a safe outlet for such feelings.
Games were also geared to enhance societal values. Feats of strength such as wrestling kept men in good physical shape. Other games such as arm-pulling tested men's endurance. The high-kick tested one's agility. In every aspect of the Inuit culture high value was placed on group achievement rather than self-achievement, and games were no exception. Grudges were never held against the winner, for the winner ultimately was responsible for the well-being of the loser.
A toy called an ajagaak was played to sharpen the senses. It consisted of a small pointed bone attached by sinew to a larger bone with a hole in the middle. Holding the bone spindle, the player would swing the larger piece and attempt to jab the spindle through the hole in the center.
While some pastimes were tests of physical endurance, others tested the mind. One such game was cat's cradle, which encouraged innovative thinking. A round of sinew was stretched between the players two hands. The participants fingers were used to form a series of loops that resembled, for example, animal shapes. The person creating the most shapes which no one could duplicate was the winner.
The Inuit were also great storytellers. Some stories were accounts of the latest hunt. But the Inuit also maintained a large repertoire of legends, many of which their society's values and stimulated the imagination. Numerous stories traditionally told by the Inuit show the close relationship between nature and the people. Some stories are morality tales about truthfulness, unselfishness and other desirable traits.
Today Inuit enjoy volleyball, basketball, badminton, ice hockey, and curling. Most communities have a school gym, a community hall and an ice hockey rink with one or two sheets of curling ice available. During the long winters various tournaments are held and people often travel from neighboring communities to compete in a variety of sports. Athletes battle not just for their own prestige, but for their home community, and the competition can be quite intense. Inuit also celebrate Christmas, Easter and Halloween, among other occasions.
Many Inuit children have computer games at home as well as Nintendo 64, Gameboy and Sega. The long winters and often adverse weather encourage stay-at-home activities. The advent of satellite technology has introduced cable television, and internet service in Nunavut through an array of community satellite dishes.
|Nunavut Image 40|
Music, Singing, and Dance
The drum dance combined music, song, dance and story. It was performed by an individual or by a group, depending on the custom of the area. In the eastern arctic the drum (made of animal skin) could be a meter in diameter. It was held in one hand, with the wrist rotating the drum back and forth. As the drum was rotated, its rim was hit with a stick held in the other hand. The drum dancer, who could also be the drummer, moved rhythmically, acting out the imagery of the accompanying song, usually a personal story.
Women in many northern communities, particularly in the eastern and central arctic practiced a form of singing called throat singing. Two women facing each other made guttural and resonant sounds through voice manipulation and breathing techniques. Often, the resulting sounds imitated the sounds of the north - the northern lights, the seashore, the wind - and evoked similar images. Some Inuit created sounds from a goose feather similar to those produce by a juice harp.
Today Inuit enjoy community feasts and dances. Drum dances are still common in many Nunavut communities, as are electric guitars and rock and roll bands. Music CD's and music channels on television have introduced the latest pop music groups from around the world to the Inuit culture. While throat singing and traditional dance are practiced by the older Inuit, the younger generation prefer more contemporary styles of music. . |Back to ""Nunavut and its People""|

Another rite practised in traditional Inuit society was child betrothal; parents customarily pledged their children to a future marriage. This drew the parents of the betrothed children into a kinship alliance, even if the marriage never took place.
Another means by which an individual was made kin was through adoption. Inuit adoption, however, created more than a bond between the adopted child and its new family. It created a link between the new parents and the natural parents. All these new links served to establish bonds of co-operation and trust between previously unrelated people.
Even partnerships, be it wrestling partners or singing or hunting partners, created kinship bonds. The use of namesakes created yet another bond. Naming a child after a recently deceased person meant that the child belonged to two families: the original and that of the namesake.
Today Inuit in most Nunavut communities are closely related. Marriages, extended families and custom adoptions continue to form bonds of kinship. This is not as much a survival mechanism today as it is a vestige of traditional life, and a function of the cultural and geographic landscape.

Child Rearing
In traditional Inuit households, children were treated with patience and gentleness, and in response, children were seldom unruly. Slapping and scolding were not regarded as acceptable forms of child control. Proper behaviour, through, was achieved through other means.
The Inuit considered generosity, mildness and gentleness to be very good traits. Since their society relied on the co-operative effort of all its members, these traits became indispensable. Losing one's temper, on the other hand, was considered disgraceful. Moreover, a rash angry act could threaten the well-being of the community.
Children developed certain traits through a subtle process of social pressure. Negative qualities such as petulance were ridiculed while positive qualities such as unselfishness were rewarded. One of the most severe forms of punishment was withdrawal of affection. In a society that relied on member's cooperation, there was nothing more life threatening than isolation. A child was never denied a wish, although an adult would try to modify a child's unreasonable request. A small child would be allowed to play with a very sharp knife, but quickly someone would distract the infant with affection and another a substitute for the knife. In other circumstances, experience was considered the best teacher. Older children for example quickly learned that knives were very sharp: one good nick usually taught them to be careful.
Today Inuit life is very different. Schools throughout Nunavut teach Canadian curriculum from K-12, with aspects of cultural immersion and inclusion. Inuit children today spend as much time in front of computers and cable television, as children anywhere in Canada. By December, 2000, every Nunavut commmunity will have a local internet server and Inuit children will be connected to the world wide web.
|Nunavut Image 47|
Education
Education took place within the family and the community circle. By constant exposure to their parents and other adults in the community, children learned all they needed to live successfully.
The Inuit of old did not have a written language, so skills and knowledge were passed down by word of mouth. After a successful hunt, for example, the details would be shared with the community. The children, boys in particular, listened to reports of the hunters' latest venture and learned from them. The hunters would describe in detail the location where they spotted the animal. They would give elaborate accounts of the animal's behaviour and how they responded to that behaviour. Besides listening to the hunters' stories, the children enacted their own hunts by watching animals and observing their behaviour. They also tried to stalk animals, which required great patience.
But being patient was part of life and children learned this too. If a family was confined to the igloo because of a storm, children entertained themselves. After all, bad weather or sickness couldn't be controlled: one simply learned to live with it. Waiting was a part of life. Ajurnamat, the people would say: ""it can't be helped."" Another important aspect of children's education was learning to orient themselves in their surroundings. Children learned from an early age to memorize the landscape.
In traditional Inuit society there were no laws as we know them today. Taboos and rituals, however, did restrict behaviour. Fear of criticism and rejection were two strong forces that controlled people's actions. Today Inuit attend elementary schools and high school, and are subject to federal and territorial laws which are administered in every Nunavut community by the RCMP and municipal by-law officers. There are also restrictions and licences required for the handling of firearms and the hunting of animals, monitored by the Nunavut government's renewable resource officers. Many Inuit today can read and write both English and Inuktitut, and much of their oral history has now been written down and documented.
|Nunavut Image 45|
Language
The language of the Inuit (Inuktitut) existed without written form until missionaries went North in the 18th and 19th centuries. But the Inuit possessed more than an oral language. They also maintained a non-verbal language that relied on body expression and other cues to display feelings. So, the Inuit learned to interpret human behaviour in the same manner they read animal behaviour.
Inuktitut today, as in the past, reflects and reinforces the Inuit's culture and value system. Strong emphasis is placed on nature and its elements. There are dozens of words to describe snow, for in the north the weather can produce a wide range of snow conditions, and the quality of snow is of great significance to the Inuit. Only certain types of snow, for example, make good igloos.
In Inuktitut there is no distinction between animate and inanimate objects. But distinction is drawn between things that are named and things that are not. The land, for example, has many names, as does man. Therefore, there is a relationship between the two.
Today many Inuit read and write both English and Inuktitut. Middle aged and elderly Inuit are mainly unilingual in Inuktitut, or speak some English, while the younger Inuit are mainly bi-lingual. English, French, Inuktitut and Innuinuqtun (a dialect of Inuktitut) are the official languages of Nunavut today.
|Nunavut Image 78|
Health
The Inuit were, by and large, a healthy people. Their diet was protein rich and provided all the necessary nutrients. Major problems arose, however, during periodic bouts of starvation that could severely weaken a community and in some cases lead to the death of many members.
In the treatment of common ailments, however, the Inuit relied on the herbs and plants they collected during the summer. They also made use of animal by-products in their healing techniques. Lemming skins were used as bandages and acted as an antiseptic agent. Caribou, seal, or bear fat was used for the same purpose.
With the coming of non-natives to the north, the Inuit were exposed to many diseases. Having little or no immunity to these foreign illnesses, the Inuit died by the hundreds. During the early 1900's Spanish influenza hit the Labrador Inuit and destroyed about one-third of the population. In 1902 the majority of the Southampton Island population was wiped out. By 1910 the MacKenzie Delta Inuit population had dropped drastically.
Today Inuit have health care provided by Nunavut Government. Each Nunavut community has a Health Center, staffed by nurses and community health workers. A doctor and dentist often do a circuit, travelling through 6-7 communities every few months to administer to the ill. Serious injuries are flown to Yellowknife or Iqaluit by regular airplane or on a medi-vac if it is an emergency situation. The medi-vac is usually a Lear jet based in a particular community, and is designated for medical emergencies. Most Inuit receive a high standard of medical treatment today, and attend hospitals for births, etc.
|Nunavut Image 79|
Religion
The life of the Inuit was intimately bound to the natural environment, and in traditional religion this same emphasis was apparent. Religion and spirituality was in the form of nature worship. The unpredictable forces of nature were believed to be controlled by powerful spirits, and it was important to appease these spirits when they had been angered. This responsibility to protect people from spirits fell to the shamans - the Inuit medicine men or women.
The shaman was the intermediary between the human world and the spirit one. When the sea goddess showed her anger by causing storms over the ocean or by witholding the sea mammals it was the shaman's duty to divine what had made her angry and what would appease her. This involved performing certain rituals. It was hoped that once the sea goddess was happy, the animals would become available to the hunters.
It was believed that the shamans possessed magical powers, such as the ability to fly, turn themselves into animals or read people's minds. Good shamans were said to have healing powers and be able to cure illnesses by expelling evil spirits from the body. Evil shamans, however, were capable of murderous acts.
Another traditional Inuit religious belief was that human spirits lived on after people died. The spirit of a deceased person would eventually occupy a newborn who had received the spirit's mortal name. The child, it was believed, would acquire its namesake's soul and abilities.
Today many Inuit follow either the Catholic or Anglican faith. Missionaries from these two denominations came to the Arctic in the early 1900's, bringing medecines, technology and faith. The Inuit were impressed and bought the whole package. Older Inuit still have faith in shamans, and their ideology is a blend of traditional beliefs and modern theology. Many of the missionaries were devout priests and ministers who learned Inuktitut and the Inuit culture and who passionately wanted to make life better for their parishioners.
|Nunavut Image 84|
Recreation
The life of the Inuit was not all hard work. As long as there was plenty of food and no immediate chores to be done, or when a severe winter storm kept everyone house-bound, there was time to indulge in pastimes.
One pastime the Inuit children enjoyed was games. Children spent a lot of time outside playing tag or hide and seek or pretending to hunt. But there were other games for the young and old during the long, dark winter months, when there was little else to do. During winter, families were often restricted to their small igloos. Games served to break the monotony and acted as a release for pent-up energy and emotions. Since it was considered disgraceful to show open hostility, games became a safe outlet for such feelings.
Games were also geared to enhance societal values. Feats of strength such as wrestling kept men in good physical shape. Other games such as arm-pulling tested men's endurance. The high-kick tested one's agility. In every aspect of the Inuit culture high value was placed on group achievement rather than self-achievement, and games were no exception. Grudges were never held against the winner, for the winner ultimately was responsible for the well-being of the loser.
A toy called an ajagaak was played to sharpen the senses. It consisted of a small pointed bone attached by sinew to a larger bone with a hole in the middle. Holding the bone spindle, the player would swing the larger piece and attempt to jab the spindle through the hole in the center.
While some pastimes were tests of physical endurance, others tested the mind. One such game was cat's cradle, which encouraged innovative thinking. A round of sinew was stretched between the players two hands. The participants fingers were used to form a series of loops that resembled, for example, animal shapes. The person creating the most shapes which no one could duplicate was the winner.
The Inuit were also great storytellers. Some stories were accounts of the latest hunt. But the Inuit also maintained a large repertoire of legends, many of which their society's values and stimulated the imagination. Numerous stories traditionally told by the Inuit show the close relationship between nature and the people. Some stories are morality tales about truthfulness, unselfishness and other desirable traits.
Today Inuit enjoy volleyball, basketball, badminton, ice hockey, and curling. Most communities have a school gym, a community hall and an ice hockey rink with one or two sheets of curling ice available. During the long winters various tournaments are held and people often travel from neighboring communities to compete in a variety of sports. Athletes battle not just for their own prestige, but for their home community, and the competition can be quite intense. Inuit also celebrate Christmas, Easter and Halloween, among other occasions.
Many Inuit children have computer games at home as well as Nintendo 64, Gameboy and Sega. The long winters and often adverse weather encourage stay-at-home activities. The advent of satellite technology has introduced cable television, and internet service in Nunavut through an array of community satellite dishes.
|Nunavut Image 40|
Music, Singing, and Dance
The drum dance combined music, song, dance and story. It was performed by an individual or by a group, depending on the custom of the area. In the eastern arctic the drum (made of animal skin) could be a meter in diameter. It was held in one hand, with the wrist rotating the drum back and forth. As the drum was rotated, its rim was hit with a stick held in the other hand. The drum dancer, who could also be the drummer, moved rhythmically, acting out the imagery of the accompanying song, usually a personal story.
Women in many northern communities, particularly in the eastern and central arctic practiced a form of singing called throat singing. Two women facing each other made guttural and resonant sounds through voice manipulation and breathing techniques. Often, the resulting sounds imitated the sounds of the north - the northern lights, the seashore, the wind - and evoked similar images. Some Inuit created sounds from a goose feather similar to those produce by a juice harp.
Today Inuit enjoy community feasts and dances. Drum dances are still common in many Nunavut communities, as are electric guitars and rock and roll bands. Music CD's and music channels on television have introduced the latest pop music groups from around the world to the Inuit culture. While throat singing and traditional dance are practiced by the older Inuit, the younger generation prefer more contemporary styles of music. . |Back to ""Nunavut and its People""|

Nunavut
People have inhabited the Canadian Arctic continuously for the past 4,000 years - in fact the Arctic was the last habitable region of the world to be occupied by people. The people of the Dorset, Thule and Inuit cultures were innovative and learned how to use the limited arctic resources to become self-sufficient. For thousands of years the Inuit and their ancestors made their own clothes, built houses, hunted, fished, and raised their families. They also supplied their own health care, recreation and education, and used dog-teams to travel great distances. When European explorers came to the Arctic looking for a Northwest Passage in the 1570's, they interacted with some Inuit villages, but did not significantly impact the Inuit lifestyle. It was during the 1800's when the whaling industry moved to the Arctic, that the Inuit lifestyle began to change. The whalers, and later on merchants and fur traders, brought new tools and technology to the Inuit, as well as devastating diseases which wiped out entire camps. Inuit life is very different in the Canadian Arctic today. The advent of satellite technology has had a profound effect on isolated Inuit Arctic communities. While strong traditional values and ethics are woven into the fabric of many Nunavut communities, Inuit are now adapting and using home computers, telephones, cable TV and the Internet.
|Nunavut Image 44|
Transportation
For generations the Inuit people of Nunavut lived a traditional life in the Arctic, moving from one place to another with the seasons, to hunt caribou, muskox and seal, or fish for char and whitefish. Inuit did not wander aimlessly in search of meat and fish. They visited the same seasonal hunting and fishing camps each year to harvest food.
Their lifestyle was semi-nomadic moving three or four times a year. They might catch whatever they could along the way, but they always had a specific destination. Many Inuit groups would spend the winters in snowhouses on the sea ice hunting seals, springtime on the coast catching seals and fish, and summertime inland hunting caribou. In between they would harvest berries, birds eggs, fish for lake trout or cod and use whatever food nature provided.
When the hunting was good, the spring, summer and fall were times to hunt and travel, while the mid-winter was a time to spend with the family, tell stories, play games, and learn about Inuit oral history and Inuit legends.
The Inuit invented various types of transportation to travel in the Arctic. For most of the year the Arctic was a frozen land. The lakes and rivers were frozen, and the Arctic Ocean had 1.5m -2 m of sea ice covering it for 8-9 months each year.
Walking was the most common form of transport in the Arctic. Inuit would pack their children, their hunting tools and everything they needed for the winter and walk perhaps hundreds of kilometers from a summer camp to a winter camp. They often left behind the tools and implements needed for hunting caribou and other summer activities, because they would revisit their summer camp next year, and much of what they needed would remain there.
Coastal Inuit used small boats called kayaks to hunt for walrus and seals, and larger boats for called umiaks to hunt larger prey such as beluga and bowhead whales. The boat frame was sometimes made with driftwood or caribou antler and sealskin or walrus hide was used to cover the frame. Different Inuit groups used different types of kayak and umiak depending on the materials available and the prey being hunted.
Today most Inuit use snowmobiles to travel on the land. For 8-9 months of the year there is sufficient snow on the land and ice on the frozen ocean and lakes to make snowmobile travel practicable. During the 3-4 months of summer, many Inuit use ATV. The trade names of ""Ski-Doo"" and ""Honda"" are used interchangeably to refer to a snowmobile or ATV.
Inter-community travel is usually by airplane. Aircraft are the vital link connecting many communities. They transport passengers, mail, supplies and groceries all year, weather permitting.
Some Inuit still maintain dog-teams, and many commercial sportshunts have to be conducted by dog-team to ensure a traditional and equitable challenge. Many people also use a boat and motor during the brief summer period when the ocean is free of ice. The ubiquitous 18' open boat with a 50hp outboard motor is a common sight in many Nunavut communities, althought for 9-10 months of the year the boat is unusable due to winter conditions.
|Nunavut Image 85|
The traditional life - economy
The climate dictated when and where they would move. An early spring meant the caribou could migrate early. A late spring and cold summer meant the caribou might be late or change their migratory route altogether. Tradtionally caribou would be hunted at a river crossing or from a caribou blind. Using bow and arrow or spears the Inuit hunter had to get close to the caribou for a successful hunt.
When caribou migrated in large herds, sometimes hundreds of thousands they were easier to catch, and so timing was important. The Inuit camp had to be established and ready for the caribou migrations coming North in the spring and South in the fall. If they missed a fall harvest the camp might go hungry or even starve during the winter.
When an animal was caught, the camp shared the food equally. Sharing and interdependency were traits of the traditional Inuit economy. Within the camp there were different people with different skills. One man might be a good seal hunter, a lady might be a good maker of waterproof footwear, and another may be good at making tools. All these skills were needed for the camp to survive, as well as good navigators, good shamans, and a variety of other skills.
No one individual had all the skills necessary, and the survival of the group was dependent on the skills and abilities of the individuals. Similarly if a hunter were injured, his family would be provided with food and care until he recovered. Camp size was determined by the number of animals (food) in the immediate area, to support that camp. Too many people and not enough food meant the camp would have to split up, with one group moving to a new location. If there were lots of caribou and seal, smaller camps could unite and families could afford to have more children.
Today Inuit still maintain elements of sharing and interdependency in their culture, but life has changed and Nunavut today has adopted a wage economy. The need for income to purchase groceries, pay mortgages, and buy boats, ATV's and Ski-Doos has encouraged many Inuit to take jobs with the Nunavut government and municipal governments. The Canadian dollar has become the medium of exchange. There is still significant sharing when caribou and seal are available, but the population of many Nunavut communities is too large to live off the land. A traditional camp the size of an average Nunavut community would not survive. There are too many people and not enough resources in the local area. The camp would likely have to breakup, the people disperse into smaller camps and spread out over a larger hunting and fishing area. The centralization and urbanization of Canadian Inuit into 28 Nunavut communities has eroded traditional and cultural pursuits and values, but has facilitated the delivery of contemporary education, employment and health care.

The Family: Rules of Kinship
While kinship usually applies to people related either by blood or marriage, the Inuit extended this term to include friends, neighbors and associates. By certain rituals these individuals all became one's relatives.
A common way to unite families in Inuit or any other society is through marriage. Another rite practised in traditional Inuit society was child betrothal; parents customarily pledged their children to a future marriage. This drew the parents of the betrothed children into a kinship alliance, even if the marriage never took place.
Another means by which an individual was made kin was through adoption. Inuit adoption, however, created more than a bond between the adopted child and its new family. It created a link between the new parents and the natural parents. All these new links served to establish bonds of co-operation and trust between previously unrelated people.
Even partnerships, be it wrestling partners or singing or hunting partners, created kinship bonds. The use of namesakes created yet another bond. Naming a child after a recently deceased person meant that the child belonged to two families: the original and that of the namesake.
Today Inuit in most Nunavut communities are closely related. Marriages, extended families and custom adoptions continue to form bonds of kinship. This is not as much a survival mechanism today as it is a vestige of traditional life, and a function of the cultural and geographic landscape.

Gjoa Haven
The community of Gjoa Haven is located about 250 kilometers above the Arctic Circle in the central part of the Nunavut Territory. It is home to about 1,000 people (Jan, 2000) of which 950 are Inuit and 50 non-Inuit. Gjoa Haven is a typical Nunavut community in regards to ethnicity, population, lifestyle, and the economy.
The Northern
The Northern Store and the Qiqitak Coop are the two main stores in town. Both are general stores in that they sell groceries, dry goods, Ski-Doos, boats and motors, etc. We have a small confectionery named ""Akkiks"", which opens 3-4 nights a week for a few hours to sell pop, chips, chocolate bars and cigarettes. We also have a take-out ""Gjoa's Shoppe"" which sells bars, cigarettes, and some fast food such as french fries, and again they are open 4-5 nights a week.
Qiqitak Co-op
The Northern changed its name from the 'Bay' in 1992, and used to be known as the Hudson Bay Co. In many communities, including Gjoa Haven, the Northern is built on the site of an old Hudson's Bay Trading Post. Qiqitak Co-op is part of the Arctic Federated Co-op family, which operates general stores in 24 Nunavut communities. Both stores have the same type of merchandise and charge similar prices. At left is a photo of people parking their Ski-Doos outside the Qiqitak Coop to do some shopping, pick up their mail, or perhaps pay a telephone or Cable TV bill.
Prices
Prices vary from one Nunavut community to another and they change throughout the year. An annual sealift barge brings most of the non-perishable goods to Gjoa Haven stores but things like milk, cheese, eggs, bread, fruits and vegetables have to be flown in each week. Each store stockpiles supplies from the barge but when they run out of Coke, sugar, or any such item, they have to fly those products in. The price goes up accordingly because of the high air-freight rates. The air-freight from Yellowknife to Gjoa Haven is about $3.20 per kg. which makes perishable items quite expensive. A 4-liter jug of milk cost $13.00 in Gjoa Haven compared to $4.00 in Edmonton. Heavier items like potatoes, bananas, cantaloupe or cabbage are also 3-4 times as much as in Edmonton. There is a Canada Post subsidy for stores to fly in perishable (healthy) foods, but air freight and store expenses conspire to keep prices high. Many people order supplies for themselves on the barge and stockpile groceries and dry goods in their homes, in an effort to save money. Non-perishable items such as coffee, sugar, fishing poles, music CDs and Ski-Doo parts are stockpiling food at home.
Stores
Stores are usually open six days a week, and they employ many Inuit people on cash, stocking shelves, and in the office. Because the communities are relatively small by Canadian standards, the stores quite often provide many other types of services such as: banking services, post office, cable TV service, video rentals, mail orders, photo developing and are a clearing house for many arts and crafts products from local artisans.
Amundsen Hotel being painted
Gjoa Haven has one large hotel, and a small bed and breakfast. The Amundsen Hotel is owned by the Qiqitaq Coop, and can accommodate 26 people in 13 rooms. Mary's Inn is a Bed and Breakfast, owned by a local development corporation joint-venture. It has four rooms that can accommodate 5 people, but additional buildings (houses) can be used if they are needed.
Both places have a restaurant or eating facility just for guests. Local residents are not permitted to dine at the hotel unless they have a room. The daily rate for a room with three meals is $210 at the Amundsen Hotel and $170 at Mary's Inn. The cost is not a function of the quality of service, as much as it is supply and demand. These prices are on par with the costs at other Nunavut hotels. Most hotel guests are travelling on behalf of government or construction companies and the costs are borne by big business.
The hotel industry is very seasonal in Nunavut. When the weather starts to warm up in April, contractors come around to look at projects or do some groundwork. As well government employees visit various Nunavut communities to introduce new community programs. The busy season lasts 6 months, until about October, when the weather cools - construction slows down, and government budgets are almost depleted. During the peak of the summer months both the Hotel and the B&B have been known to add extra bunks in each room to accommodate the overflow of construction workers, or a group of people in town for a conference. The hotel industry is subject to government rules and regulations. Hotel conditions vary from one community to another, but the nature of the industry is boom (in summer) and bust (in winter). Allowances are made as the alternative of sleeping in a snow bank is usually less palatable.
Recreation
Recreation is an important part of life in Gjoa Haven. The winters last from Sept. to May, with about six-weeks of the mid-winter in 24 hour darkness. The ambient temperature from Dec. to Mar. is about -35 degrees Celsius, with windchills dropping it another 15-20 degrees on many days.
For much of the year it is dark and cold outside and many people are unemployed during the winter months. Half the population of Gjoa Haven is under 18 years of age and typically the young get bored with nothing to do. To combat boredom and Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD), which affects some people during the period of 24-hour darkness, most Nunavut communities have excellent recreational facilities. In Gjoa Haven we have a full size hockey arena and a school gym where basketball, volleyball and badminton tournaments take place - women, kids, elders, anyone and everyone is welcome to participate in various tournaments throughout the winter. Hockey is the most popular sport in Gjoa Haven, and many Gjoa Haven youth are excellent skaters and hockey players. Recreation is always important, and throughout the long arctic winter, it helps keep you healthy, both mentally and physically.
Other forms of recreation enjoyed in Gjoa Haven are feasts and dances, which take place throughout the year. Gjoa Haven residents take every opportunity to enjoy a feast or drum dance, and the functions are very sociable and a lot of fun. If a friend or relative comes to visit, the community will have a dance to honor their visit. At Christmas time, our community hall hosts a dance every night with games and activities for all ages, often going until 6:00 in the morning. Gjoa Haven is a dry community (no liquor) and all the social functions serve to exhibit the amicable and gregarious nature of our community.
When the summer solstice begins and we get sunshine 24 hours a day (around May 1st) the Hamlet of Gjoa Haven has a week of games and activities to celebrate the arrival of the summer sun. The community has various games and contests such as sled racing, Ski-Doo races, and igloo building contests. Everyone is welcome to participate and they have separate contests for boys and girls, men and ladies with cash prizes for each competition.
During the summer months many Gjoa Haven residents enjoy boating and fishing. The community has a softball field, (more gravel than field) but for most residents, summer is a time to be out on the land and many people leave the community in June and return in August or September. Camping on the land during the summer is a traditional recreational pursuit as caribou, muskoxen, seals, geese and arctic char are in abundance. Many people like to hunt and fish, enjoy the traditional lifestyle and stock up on food for the winter.

Quqshuun Illihakvik
In Gjoa Haven the school (Quqshuun Illihakvik) encompasses levels Kindergarten to Grade 12. The school used to go to Grade 8 but in 1997 it was expanded to include Grades 9 -12. After completing Grade 10 students have to go to Cambridge Bay to complete high school. We also have Nunavut Arctic College in the community. The college delivers adult education and upgrading, as well as specialty courses in such areas as office management, jewellry making, computer studies and other short term courses as required.
Nunavut Arctic College boarded up during summer months
Education is a relatively new phenomenon for Gjoa Haven, and in fact for much of Nunavut. Our school opened in 1972, and many local residents had no opportunity for formal education prior to that date. Many Inuit continue to give their children a traditional education in hunting, fishing, and other cultural pursuits and teach their children traditional Inuit values and skills. While it is important that Inuit continue to learn and remember their traditions and values, it doesn't preclude an education in math, science, language and computers.
Schools and education came to Gjoa Haven as part of the government package of housing, social services, and a wage economy, along with centralization and urbanization and which many Inuit do not yet fully endorse.
The prevailing attitude towards school and education, along with other systemic factors, is reflected in the statistic that less than 10% of Inuit students throughout Nunavut graduate from high school. At Quqshuun Illihakvik 42 students started kindergarten in Sept 1999, while only five students graduated from Grade 10 the previous year. Language immersion is another issue. In Gjoa Haven Inuktitut immersion is the norm for Grades K-2, after that it's English. The Nunavut Government is now considering a policy to incorporate Inuktitut imersion into the curriculum of all Nunavut Schools, for K-4. Since 85% of Nunavut's population are Inuit, the immersion program will have a big impact in preserving Inuit language and culture.
Power Plant
Gjoa Haven generates all its own power. A power grid and telephone poles carry electricity throughout the community to every home, office, school and building that uses power. The power plant is composed of three large generators, which run on diesel fuel. The main generator is the principal producer for community electricity, and if that generator should fail or malfunction, a back-up generator will automatically kick-in within a few minutes. The third generator is an auxiliary unit should there be a problem with the first two.
Our community is highly dependent on power, moreso for heat than light. During the winter months if the power fails, you can feel your house get cold within 20-30 minutes. Each home and building has an oil-heated furnace, which needs power to operate, and with a power failure the temperature inside the home drops quickly. The danger in losing heat/power is freeze-up. In all our homes we have water lines connecting the water tank to the sink, toilet, shower, washer, etc, and if the power is gone for 4-6 hours these lines will freeze.
Similarly in our grocery store, with a prolonged power failure all the canned goods, soda pop, fruit and vegetables, would freeze, and in general a loss of power for more than six hours or so depending on the outside temperature, would be a disaster for the community. For that reason the NTPC (Nunavut Territory Power Corp) has trained people in Gjoa Haven and in every Nunavut community, to avert prolonged power outages. If the problem is of a more serious nature, the Power company will fly in expert technicians within hours to correct the problem.
Municipal Services
The Hamlet of Gjoa Haven is our municipal government. The ""Hamlet"" looks after snow clearing, water delivery, sewage pump-outs, garbage pick-up, and by-law enforcement, among other things. Hamlet is a type of city council, with 8 locally elected 'councillors' and a community mayor. It is managed by a Senior Administrative Officer (SAO), who oversees the various local departments such as: housing maintenance, water/sewage and garbage pickup, heavy equipment and garage maintenance, community economic development, community recreation, by-law enforcement, municipal building permits and various other community services. The Hamlet basically runs the community and is the biggest employer in the community. Our Hamlet employs about 50 full-time and 25 part-time staff.
Hamlets across Nunavut are core-funded by Nunavut Government, under a formula based on population, need and other variables, and Hamlet is mandated to deliver municipal services to the community. Although the population of Gjoa Haven is about 1,000 people, the cost of maintaining local infrastructure is high. The Hamlet's annual budget can be as high as $10-12 million. Some communities are 'Municipalities', some are 'Hamlets' and Iqaluit is a 'Town'.
The Hamlet plays an important role in Gjoa Haven, as it does in all the Nunavut communities. The federal government disperses its transfer payment to Nunavut Government in Iqaluit, who then disperses a percentage to communities for municipal services. An elected Hamlet Council makes the decisions on community needs and the SAO and staff administer to those needs.
Every home, school, and building in Gjoa Haven that uses water has a water tank built inside the premises in a heated area and a sewage tank, usually located under the house with a heat trace to keep sewage from freezing. Hamlet water trucks fill up water tanks three times a week, and sewage trucks pump-out everyone's sewage three times a week. We also have garbage pick-up twice a week. Because of the logictics, the cost of this service can be $400 per household per month, but it is heavily subsidized by Nunavut Government and the average homeowner in Gjoa Haven would pay $30 - $35 a month for municipal services. We use a lake nearby for fresh water with a pumphouse to load the trucks, a sewage lagoon located one or two km out of town, for dumping sewage. We also have an open pit away from the community for all the community garbage.
Hamlet also is in charge of community by-laws. By-laws deal with building permits, land usage, care and handling of dogs, garbage pick-up, snow clearing and many administrative processes within the Hamlet structure. One by-law states that children under 16 have to be at home or in their house by 10:00 PM during the winter, to encourage early retirement on school nights. A siren sounds at 10 PM and the by-law officer will drive around the hamlet ushering kids home, although sometimes it becomes more of a game of hide-and-seek.
Another by-law states that husky dogs have to be tied down. On a first offence the owner is fined, on a second offence the dog may be shot. When huskies get loose they sometimes form a pack and have been known to attack a child or elderly person.
Arts/Crafts
Gjoa Haven is typical of Nunavut communities in that it has many artisans who make traditional soapstone carvings, jewelry, sewn items and Inuit art; however, the quality of work produced by Gjoa Haven carvers is recognized in the industry as exceptional. There are two or three 'pockets' of very talented carvers and artisans in Nunavut, and our Gjoa Haven carvers have a very good reputation.
As an industry, the arts and crafts sector has been a roller coaster over the past ten years. The prices carvers earn for the same type of carvings will range from $200 - $500 throughout the year, based on local supply and demand and the volatile worldwide demand for Inuit arts and crafts. Due to the nature of the industry, the financial benefits accrued through the sale of carvings does not often go to the Inuit carver who created the artwork. Gjoa Haven carvers have sold carvings locally to the Northern or Coop store for $500-$600, and then seen those same carvings on sale at a gallery in Yellowknife for $5,000-$6,000. (1000% mark-up).
It is the nature of Inuit artists to be independent thinkers and creative people. These same attributes which produce beautiful works of art, hinder the carvers from working in groups or associations, so they can get better prices and better markets for their products collectively.
Still many Inuit carvers earn a living and support their family through arts and crafts. Soapstone is the preferred medium for artwork in Gjoa Haven because it is soft and easy to work with and it is free. Carvers will usually travel in a group of three or four Ski-Doos and sleds to the soapstone 'quarry', located about 80 km to the southeast of the community. Using pry bars and excavating tools, they will collect a sledfull of dark green soapstone rock. Since Gjoa Haven is located on an island (King William Island) the carvers can best collect stone when the ocean is frozen and they can travel the whole distance by snowmobile.
The carvers will bring the stone back to the community, put a chair and table outside of their house and plug in an extension cord. Today most Inuit carvers use power tools to carve. The tools are small hand tools and bits, similar in size to dentist's drills. The carvers usually wear a mask of some sort to protect their lungs, as a fine dust comes off the carvings when they are being sanded and drilled.

Health
In Gjoa Haven there is a new health care facility. The old health center was too small and a new health center was built in 1998, at a cost of $2.5 million. We have four full-time nurses and a support staff of social workers, community health workers, maintenance and administration people. Just like education, health care is free to all Nunavut residents.
Nurses in Nunavut work more independently than nurses in a more structured hospital environment and they are often asked to perform above and beyond the call of duty. There are no resident doctors in our community, but a doctor and dentist travel throughout the central arctic on a circuit, coming to Gjoa Haven three or four times a year. The doctor/dentist will stay for a couple of weeks and treat whatever patients need attention. In the mean time the nurses are asked to administer to the medical needs of the community. Since there is no drug store or pharmacists, the nurses dispense the prescription drugs after they've made a diagnosis. They often make the decision on the care and severity of injuries and illnesses whether a patient can be treated in the community, should fly down to the hospital in Yellowknife, or needs to be medi-vacced immediately in an emergency. A nurse is on call 24 hours a day and sometimes nurses will have to travel out on the land to attend to someone who was injured or became ill at their camp.
In addition to their busy schedule, many nursing stations provide a range of community medical workshops and clinics. They hold clinics for community residents about safe sex, sexually transmitted diseases, pre-natal care, health and hygiene, drugs and alcohol, nutrition and a wide range of social and medical issues.
While the nurses and support staff deal with most situations, a Lear jet is available to come to the community and fly emergency cases to Yellowknife, at a cost of $15,000 per flight. Some months there may be 20 medi-vac flights, some months 1 or 2. The costs of health care are high in the North, but the quality of attention and service in most communities is excellent. Although Nunavut has a small hospital, Yellowknife, in the Northwest Territories is closer, and most medical emergencies are brought there.
Fuel
Gjoa Haven has a 'tank farm' as do all Nunavut communities. The tank farm is a series of huge storage tanks that provide gasoline, home heating fuel, naptha and other petroleum products to community residents. Gjoa Haven's tank farm was recently renovated at a cost of $5 million. Since there is no road network in Nunavut and no highways connecting to the 'south', all the fuel has to be transported in by barge sealift, pumped to our tank farm and made to last for a full year until the next barge arrives. Gjoa Haven has flown in fuel, which is a very expensive proposition.
Again because of the logistics, a litre of gasoline brought on the barge might cost $2-3, but with government subsidies residents pay about $.80 a liter for gas and for home heating fuel. The tank farm has two pumps similar to gas stations anywhere in Canada and residents drive their ATV, pick-up truck or Ski-Doo to the tank farm for fill-up, and usually bring along 8-10 of the ubiquitous 5-gallon plastic jugs to supply fuel for their fishing or camping trips. Most Gjoa Haven residents have a dozen or so 5-gallon jugs in their shed, as they are essential for any trips outside the community. The tank farm and our local stores sell oil for gas-mix and maintenance.
Nunavut Government is very cautious in the care and handling of petroleum products and there are many rules and regulations on community tank farms. Fuel spills of any degree are treated seriously, with the contaminated ground quite often being excavated and removed, a costly effort on frozen tundra.
Anglican Church
Gjoa Haven has a Catholic Church, an Anglican Church and a Pentecostal Church in the community. Since the 1930's, when southern missionaries came to the North to establish organized religions, many Inuit communities have adopted Christian beliefs. In Gjoa Haven it was around 1960 that the Catholic and Anglican churches were built. Anglicans and Catholics represent 75% of the population. The Pentecostal Church came in 1993 and they have about a small following. The balance of residents are either agnostics, or Inuit elders who hold traditional beliefs in shamans and Inuit legends.
Catholic Church
In traditional communities like Gjoa Haven religion is a sensitive subject - people take religion seriously. For thousands of years Inuit people held traditional beliefs with a wholistic view of life, whereby: the animals of the land, fish in the sea, the earth, wind and all the elements were interrelated. Every living thing was the hunter and the hunted, predator and prey. From the mighty polar bear to the ubiquitous ringed seal, Inuit would hunt and use all parts of the animals for food, clothing and sustinence, both for them and their dog-team. The hunt was life and a spiritual experience. Similarly when an Inuit died their spirit was returned to the earth in both the physical and spiritual sense.
Religion
Physically, the dead were sometimes buried under a loose covering of stones, or left on the tundra for their remains to be returned to the earth. Contributing to this practice was the fact that burial in the permafrost was impractical and impossible. Sometimes an older person would intentionally wander away from the camp when they felt their usefullness was expired, or they had become a non-contributing member of the camp, and another mouth to feed. Inuit camps sometimes starved during the winters, when food was scarce or the caribou didn't migrate as they were expected. There often was a legitimate correlation between the amount of food, and the number of productive members in camp.
Spiritually, traditional Inuit beliefs include reincarnation. When someone dies, his spirit is reincarnated and reborn in the next baby born to the family, or the camp. Quite often the name of the deceased is adopted by a new generation.
Economy
Gjoa Haven is a traditional community in transition to a wage economy. While traditional pursuits such as hunting, fishing, carving, etc put food on the table and support many families, the creation of Nunavut and the decentralization of Nunavut Government offices to Gjoa Haven and other small communities, is having a positive effect on our economy.
Many residents work for the various Nunavut Government departments, such as Health, Social Services, Education, Motor Vehicles and Justice, although many of the senior positions are staffed by professionals recruited from southern Canada. Our Hamlet Office employs 70-75 full and part-time people to administer municipal services. The third largest employer is the construction industry. For 3-4 months each year there is a construction boom in Gjoa Haven as there is in every Nunavut community, whereby, new houses, school additions, health centers, etc are built. When the weather turns cold near the end of Sept, many people are laid off and are unemployed during the winter.
Employment is very much tied to the seasons in Gjoa Haven and in Nunavut. During the summer months there is usually lots of work for everyone, and during the winter the community goes into hibernation, like the animals of the land. Construction is seasonal. We get the occasional camera crew and tour boat, some fishermen, sportsmen and a few tourists who come during the summer and create employment for local guides. Many government employment programs tend to operate during the summer, creating more employment. During the winter, construction slows down, the tourists and sportsmen stay away, and people tend to stay at home and hibernate.
The nature of 'work' is also changing. Just ten years ago, traditional skills and pursuits were essential, not just to learn how to survive on the land, but to put food on the table. With new opportunities created through Nunavut Government policies of decentralization, communities like Gjoa Haven are experiencing employment opportunities and a new demand for trained and educated Inuit.
Law and Order
Gjoa Haven has two resident RCMP officers based in the community. The RCMP are usually from parts of southern Canada and they stay for a 2-3 year term. In 1998 we had a new RCMP station constructed with office space, a waiting room, coffee room, and two holding cells, at a cost of $1 million. Our community by-law officer often works with the RCMP on projects.
Serious crimes are not a big problem in Gjoa Haven, or throughout Nunavut. Gjoa Haven has been an alcohol-free community for 18 years and that contributes to the quality of life in many ways. When a crime is committed, perhaps an assault or a break and enter, the person is charged. If they have been drinking they will spend the night in our local jail. Once charged they are usually released on their own recognizance, and will have to attend court when the court party comes to town (about three times a year).
The court party consists of a circuit judge, prosecuting and defence lawyers, court clerks and assorted support staff. They may stay one or two days in Gjoa Haven, to hear all the cases pending. People usually plead guilty and receive a small fine. If it is a repeat offender with a long record they may be sentenced to a jail term of 3-6 months. In that case the RCMP will put them in jail for the night and the next day they'll escort the prisoner to Yellowknife for transport to a correctional facility in Hay River.
The RCMP have two twin otters based in Nunavut, and sometimes the RCMP plane will stop in Gjoa Haven to pick up prisoners. RCMP use a lot of equipment in their detachment. Each station has a pick-up truck for patrol, a good boat and motor, a couple of Ski-Doos and ATVs, good communications equipment and a reserve of supplies on a loaded komatik.The RCMP are the central agency for coordinating search and rescue efforts, and the detachment needs to be ready when an emergency occurs.
Law and order is a difficult job in a small community. You may arrest someone one day and be playing hockey with them the next night, or if it's the son of the mayor or a community leader you may be asked to attend a council meeting to defend your position. It takes a special type of character to function in the fishbowl-type life of a small community.
Transportation
The transportation options into Gjoa Haven are limited. Nunavut is the only province or territory in Canada that has no roads leading into it. In other words you cannot drive into Nunavut, or any Nunavut community from anywhere else in Canada. Similarly very few Nunavut communities are interconnected by road. To visit Gjoa Haven or travel in Nunavut, you have to fly.
The airlines are the lifeline to the outside world. Six days a week we have a commercial carrier that travels from Yellowknife to our community. The plane carries passengers, mail, perishable groceries such as bread, milk, fruit and vegetables, and general cargo such as Ski-Doo parts, small tools and equipment. The planes change their configuration each day adjusting the number of seats to correspond with the number of passengers, so that each flight maximizes the payload of passengers and cargo.
For many years we had just one airline (First Air) but in 1999 a second carrier began competing (Canadian North). Both airlines have similar routes, schedules and prices . Their routes service the central arctic communities of Cambridge Bay, Gjoa Haven, Taloyoak and Pelly Bay each day, making a return trip to and from Yellowknife, Northwest Territories. Air travel is very expensive in Nunavut, which is reflective of the high operating and maintenance costs for the airlines.
Once each year Gjoa Haven has an annual resupply from a sealift barge. The barge arrives in the first week of September, once the Arctic Ocean is clear of ice. Our barge is owned and operated by Northern Transportation Company Limited (NTCL), and is based in Hay River, NWT. The barge is actually a series of flatdeck barges towed by a tugboat. The barge travels from Hay River, down the MacKenzie River to the community of Tuktoyaktuk, on the Beaufort Sea, where a sea tug then tows the barges through Coronation Gulf along the famed Northwest Passage, and on to Gjoa Haven and other central arctic communities. The voyage from Hay River to Gjoa Haven takes a full two months, and any materials or supplies that are transported by barge have to be ordered many months in advance. Our grocery store brings in a year's supply of non-perishable groceries and dry goods by barge sealift, and many contractors bring in heavy equipment or the materials to construct new houses, schools and other structures.
The average cost of barge freight is about $1.00 per kg. as compared to the average air freight of $3.20 per kg. It is much more economical to bring in supplies by barge. You can only use the barge once a year, and unfortunately for Gjoa Haven, it arrives at the end of the summer construction season. Contractors often bring in construction materials on the barge in September, have them sit all winter and start building the following year in June, when the weather warms up.
For inter-community travel people may fly, or occasionally a group of Gjoa Haven residents will travel by snowmobile to Taloyoak, Pelly Bay or Baker Lake for a hockey tournament or community feast. The flat frozen Arctic Ocean is a highway for Ski-Doos for 8-9 months each year. Generally those travelling by Ski-Doo will travel in a small convoy or group, stopping for tea and conversation along the way. Taloyoak is the closest community to Gjoa Haven, about 100 km to the NE, and you can travel one-way by Ski-Doo in 5-6 hours. Baker Lake is about a two-day trip by Ski-Doo as it is 300 km to the south, but it also takes two days to fly there because Baker Lake is on a different air route, a circuitous route via Yellowknife.
Drugs/Alcohol
Gjoa Haven has been an alcohol-free community since 1982. Through the Hamlet Council and a community plebiscite every five years, community residents have chosen to adopt a by-law which makes the possession or consumption of alcohol illegal, within the municipal boundaries.
Our community is unique in that respect. In most Nunavut communities you are permitted to import and consume alcohol, although some communities restrict the quantity of alcohol allowed. Being a 'dry' community means that if you have alcohol in your possession or on your breath you go straight to jail and are charged with a small fine (usually about $50.). Every Nunavut community has its own rules on alcohol because of its impact on families and people in the community.
We have long winters in Gjoa Haven and a very young population, typical of most Nunavut communities. Too much free time and a high unemployment rate during the winter can make life boring for younger people, and increase the attraction of drugs and alcohol. Municipal by-laws may curb the use of banned substances, but never eliminate them.
There have been a number of charges brought to trial for light drug use in the community, usually related to marijuana possession. Our community hasn't had an instance of 'heavy' drug use such as heroin. It seems this is more of a problem for the larger and more affluent regions.
Home with satellite dish
With recent technological improvements and satellite link-ups, Gjoa Haven and most Nunavut communities now have excellent communication facilities. Satellite dishes were installed in all the Nunavut communities during the 1980's and direct dial telephones are commonplace. From time to time when there are solar flares, the phone lines are sporadic but most of the year a resident can place a direct distance call from Gjoa Haven to anywhere in the world.
Communications
Similarly in the 1990's, satellite dishes were installed in all the Nunavut communities which bring in cable television. We get 25 TV stations through our local cable company (Qiqitaq Co-op). They range from the Sports Network (TSN) to Much Music (MTV) to a channel for youth (YTV), six or seven channels from Canadian cities (ITV-Edmonton, ONTV-Ontario, etc) and eight or nine USA channels from Los Angeles, Detroit, Chicago, etc. Some residents also choose to purchase and install their own home-based satellite dishes, but reception is poor with the smaller dishes because of our location so far North.
Many Inuit children have Nintendo 64, Gameboy and other such entertainment, as well as home computers and computer games. By June, 2000 all Nunavut communities will have another satellite dish installed which will provide a local internet server for each community. The advent of satellite technology has opened much of the Arctic to communications systems similar to any urban area in Canada or the United States.
Within the community and the local area many people use shortwave radios. In Gjoa Haven many households have a CB Radio to communicate with each other and to talk to Hamlet water trucks and sewage trucks for ordering a fill-up or pump-out. When people travel outside the community and go to their camp for a weekend or for the summer, quite often they bring a Red Radio, which is a crystal based unit capable of communicating over several hundred kilometers.
These radios are light and durable and run on D batteries. Camps talk to each other at night when transmissions are clear and, in the event of a medical or other emergency, a red radio can be used to call for help or have a helicopter dispatched.
Roald Amundsen
Gjoa Haven has an interesting history. Many Nunavut communities were created through the establishment of whaling camps, a Hudson's Bay Trading Post or a church, but Gjoa Haven was founded by an arctic explorer. In the summer of 1903, a Norwegian explorer named Roald Amundsen set forth with his crew in their small ship, the Gjoa, into the Canadian Arctic to search for and navigate the Northwest Passage . No ship had ever navigated the Northwest Passage up to this time.
Gjoa Haven
Amundsen travelled down Peel Inlet and discovered ""the finest little harbour in the world"", which at that time was an uninhabited little bay on the east side of King William Island. Amundsen anchored the Gjoa in the harbor and stayed for two years doing scientific research on the magnetic North Pole, which was located near Gjoa Haven at that time. Over the two years Inuit people from surrounding camps came to trade with Amundsen, who had loaded up his ship with metal products and other trade goods to prepare for such an opportunity.
The harbour became known as a haven for the Gjoa or ""Gjoa Haven"". After Amundsen left, the Inuit people stayed and the community was born. In the 1920's the Hudson Bay Company set up a trading post in Gjoa Haven and the community grew from there. Amundsen went on to become the first person to navigate the Northwest Passage and five years later the first person to reach the South Pole.
History
In 1849 Sir John Franklin and his two ships the 'Erebus' and 'Terror' were stuck in ice not far from Gjoa Haven, off the west coast of King William Island. Franklin and his 130 men eventually perished in the Arctic and the location of his ships and Franklin's tomb remain an arctic mystery to this day. The skeletal remains of the Franklin expedition were found where they dropped, along the coast of King William Island and 29 skeletons in one location, in a small bay named Starvation Cove.
'Erebus' and 'Terror' in pack ice
Archaelogists and expeditions have searched for Franklin's ships and tomb for the past century, but nothing has been discovered to date. No complete record of what happened to him or his men has been uncovered, and Franklin remains a genuine arctic mystery to this day. It is hoped that discovery of his tomb will reveal the ships' logs and other records that will better document the ordeal over the three years they were stuck in arctic ice.
Geography
Gjoa Haven is located on the southeast part of King William Island, 300 kilometers above the Arctic Circle (approx 68 º N, 96 º W), an area of the central arctic part of Canada that has just recently (1960's) opened up to southern 'kabloonaq' influence. This area of the central arctic is located on the Northwest Pasage and is difficult to navigate by ship because of year round ice. The seas around Gjoa Haven have no quantities of whale or walrus to attract entrepreneurs, as did areas of the eastern and western arctic, and so it remained a very traditional region late into the 20 th century. When Knud Rasmussen travelled through the area in the 1940's many Inuit had not seen a 'kabloonaq' or white man before.
The physical geography of Gjoa Haven and King William Island is very flat rolling hills, with sandy, dolomitic soil. The highest point on the 16,000 square kilometers of King William Island is a small hill, 300 m elevation above sea level. Most of the year the many rivers lakes and ponds near the community are frozen solid as is the Arctic Ocean. When you travel by Ski-Doo, it is difficult to tell if you are travelling on frozen ocean, land, river or lake.
Inukshuks
There are few landmarks to indicate location or direction, because there is little relief between land and sea. Inuit people traditionally built Inukshuks on the land to mark the location of a good camping area, perhaps where there was a good hunting or fishing spot. Sometimes a string of Inuksuit were built to mark the migratory path of the caribou.
Community Demographics
Gjoa Haven is a mid-size community by Nunavut standards. It is estimated that as of Jan 1, 2000 the community population totals 989 people. Approximately 931 residents are of Inuit ancestry and 58 are non-Inuit. This ratio indicates 94% of the community is Inuit. The overall population of Nunavut is estimated at 85% Inuit ancestry. Population figures in the table are based on the data collected by a federal government census conducted every five years.
Demographics indicate a steady increase in our population since 1986, between 15-20% every five years. One interesting fact in Gjoa Haven's population chart is the increase in the number of people in the 25-44 yrs old bracket. The increase is due to an in-migration of middle aged Inuit from neighboring communities during 1991-1996. We believe the in-migration was prompted by the fact that Gjoa Haven is a 'dry' or alcohol-free community and negative experiences in neighboring 'wet' communities prompted people to relocate. .

The Mine Site Reclamation Policy for Nunavut was released by the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development on July 29, 2002. The policy is designed to provide a resource management tool to ensure that mining operations in Nunavut do not leave a legacy of environmental and human health hazards and a financial burden on the Canadian taxpayer. The Department considers this policy an important component in developing a strong resource management base in Nunavut. It will provide certainty and clarity concerning the government's expectations on mine site reclamation. The policy was developed after extensive consultations with Inuit organizations, industry, environmental non-government organizations, Institutions of Public Government and the Government of Nunavut.

Mine Site Reclamation Policy for Nunavut
A policy for the protection of the environment and the disposition of liability relating to mine closures in Nunavut.
I am pleased to present the Mine Site Reclamation Policy for Nunavut. This policy reflects the Government of Canada's desire to ensure a strong resource management base in Nunavut while reducing the impacts to the environment and human health.
The development of this policy has included a broad-based consultation process involving representatives from Aboriginal organizations, industry, stakeholders, Northern boards and the territorial governments.
Sustainable resource development is essential to the North. Our objective is to strengthen federal standards for both the protection of the environment and the reclamation of mine sites. Through this policy we are establishing a clear standard and are providing clarity and certainty for industry and other stakeholders which will lead to sustainable and responsible development in the North.
I would like to acknowledge and thank all those who have contributed to the development of this policy. We must continue to work together to create an industry that is sustainable, profitable and environmentally responsible.
Sincerely,
Honourable Robert D. Nault
Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development
Introduction
For more than a hundred years, mines have been operating in Canada's North, providing important economic benefits, not only for northerners, but to all Canadians. Mining in the North has been good for Canada. A rough estimate of the cumulative value of metal and mineral production for the three territories since 1977 is over $18 billion
However, some mining operations closed without adequately addressing their clean-up and reclamation responsibilities, leaving hundreds of millions of dollars of clean-up costs to the federal government. While this represents a relatively small percentage of the economic benefit, in absolute terms, it still amounts to a substantial burden on the government's accounts.
The public is becoming more concerned about the growing number of insolvencies and abandoned mining properties, which are leaving significant environmental liabilities. This increased consciousness on the issue has led to out ward expressions of concern and questioning of support for mining in the North.
On April 1, 1999, Canada created the new territory of Nunavut and, with it, the expectation that Inuit would become the managers of their own destiny. This includes unprecedented participation in the management of their renewable and non-renewable resources. In essence, the creation of Nunavut has given the Inuit a ""clean slate"" to develop the kind of resource management regime they want to take with them into the new millennium. To this end, there have already been strong signals that the development of a comprehensive resource management program, particularly for mining, is a high priority.
The Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development (DIAND) is concerned with the public's eroding confidence in northern mining. It also recognizes the desire to build a strong resource management base in Nunavut. both complement DIAND's thinking and its ongoing search for opportunities responsibilities are carried out across Canada's three northern territories.
DIAND considers the Mine Site Reclamation Policy for Nunavut an important new step in the development of a comprehensive mineral resource management component of the Department's Sustainable Development Strategy.
The development of the Policy was not the only option available. Government continues to look at various legislative and regulatory initiatives to support the principles set out in this Policy. However, legislative and regulatory changes take a relatively long time to accomplish, and it is important to deal with this issue in the context of current legislation from the perspective of operating mines preparing to close in the next few years and new mines expected to open shortly.
It is critical to have resource management tools in place in Nunavut before new mineral development activities become too far advanced. Industry, investors, environmental interests and communities all share the desire for certainty, consistency and clarity.
The Mine Site Reclamation Policy for Nunavut serves four main objectives:
- Ensure the impact of mining on the environment and human health and safety is minimized.
- Reduce the environmental liability that falls to government to the greatest extent possible.
- Provide industry and the public with a clear signal of the government's expectations.
- Build positive and supportive relationships with the new regulatory authorities coming into operation in the North.
DIAND also recognizes that many of the provisions incorporated within this Policy are governmental ""principles"" that provide general guidance and direction. They work in harmony with the existing regulatory framework and the regulators charged with their application. It is not the intent of this Policy to supplant or diminish these existing regulatory authorities or the organizations that have been created to carry them out.
DIAND has been guided by The Minerals and Metals Policy of the Government of Canada, wherein specific reference is made to the challenges associated with mine site reclamation and the federal government's direct responsibilities in the three territories.
It should also be noted that DIAND is developing another complementary policy that relates to orphaned or abandoned sites, including mines. It is called the Policy on the Management of Contaminated Sites in Canada's North. This proposed policy is part of DIAND's commitment to reduce or eliminate the human health and safety dangers posed by contaminated sites, including abandoned mines.
In addition to legislation governing conventional mining, the mining of uranium and other related hazardous minerals is regulated by specific legislation (e.g., The Nuclear Safety and Control Act).
This Policy is intended to be consistent with the legislative, regulatory and policy instruments currently in effect in Nunavut, including the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement.
The Policy offers guidance for the planning and implementation of mine site reclamation in Nunavut. To a large degree, the principles outlined in this Policy have already been adopted and adhered to by the federal government and industry, within the existing regulatory framework in Nunavut. This Policy codifies, clarifies and provides more certainty. It gives a template for the development and enhancement of operational procedures and processes required to ensure that objectives are met.
Enforcement of regulatory provisions related to mine site reclamation will continue to be undertaken through the existing regulatory regime. The Territorial Lands Act and its regulations, the Northwest Territories Waters Act and the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement will be the primary vehicles used, although other pieces of federal and territorial legislation are also in play (e.g., Fisheries Act, Canadian Environmental Protection Act and Nunavut Waters and Nunavut Surface Rights Tribunal Act).
The environmental assessment processes will continue to identify and consider the environmental, social, cultural and economic effects of a mining project and its reclamation, and ensure that the potentially affected public participates during the monitoring and reporting of mine site reclamation.
The principles and objectives laid out in this Policy will guide DIAND's decision-making powers in matters where DIAND has authority and will shape DIAND's position as an intervener in regulatory processes carried out by resource management boards.
DIAND will continue to be guided by other federal policies concerning regulatory efficiency and environmental protection. Given the number of regulatory authorities emerging in the North, it is critical that this Policy be integrated with the existing regulatory and policy framework.
Application
Given the multi-jurisdictional landscape in Nunavut, application of this Policy depends on the circumstances. It will provide internal guidance to DIAND staff in the drafting of terms and conditions of regulatory instruments, such as surface leases, over which the Department retains jurisdiction and in the preparation of interventions to the resource management boards within the territory. The Policy will also inform the resource management boards of the Minister's expectations in terms of their work and what the Minister will be looking for in the regulatory instruments submitted for the Minister's approval. Finally, it tells industry what is expected in its project designs (as it relates to reclamation planning) and what industry can expect from regulatory decision makers, thereby ""fixing the goal posts"" and removing ad hoc, case-by-case interpretations.
This Policy only applies within the jurisdiction of the federal government and, as such, does not apply to those aspects of reclamation that fall within the jurisdiction of the Government of Nunavut or the Inuit as private owners of the surface of land through the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement. This would clearly include the nonwater-related aspects of surface reclamation on lands that are either owned by the Inuit pursuant to the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement or administered by the Government of Nunavut as Commissioner's land. Mining operations, which are located on a combination of Inuit-owned and Crown lands, will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis, probably, through some form of co-operative arrangement between DIAND and the Inuit land-owning organization.
This Policy applies to new and existing mines, whether operating or not, with clearly identified owners/operators. It does not cover orphaned or abandoned sites, which will fall under the proposed Policy on the Management of Contaminated Sites in Canada's North.
The Policy applies only to developed mines and to those mining-related activities that take place on mine sites. It does not apply to activities undertaken during the prospecting, exploration or advanced exploration stages of the development of a mineral property.
This policy is virtually identical to the Mine Site Reclamation Policy for the Northwest Territories (NWT) and is intended to cover mining properties which might straddle the Northwest Territories-Nunavut border. Yukon mining activities are not managed under the Territorial Lands Act/Canada Mining Regulations, and a modified policy vehicle is being developed which is consistent with Yukon's legislative and regulatory framework. It is intended that it will complement its NWT and Nunavut counterparts, to create a consistent pan-Northern policy framework.
Principles for Mine Site Reclamation
The following principles respecting mine site reclamation should provide proponents, boards and government departments with certainty, clarity and consistency regarding expectations, from project design to operations and post-closure.
1. General
- Mine site reclamation should reflect the collective desire and commitment to operate under the principles of sustainable development, including the ""polluter pays"" principle.
- The required standard of reclamation should be based on the 1994 Whitehorse Mining Initiative definition: ""returning mine sites and affected areas to viable and, wherever practicable, selfsustaining ecosystems that are compatible with a healthy environment and with human activities.""
- Every new mining operation should be able to support the cost of reclamation. Existing mining operations will also be held accountable for their reclamation liabilities.
- Adequate security should be provided to ensure the cost of reclamation, including shutdown, closure and post-closure, is born by the operator of the mine rather than the Crown.
- Best management practices, including progressive reclamation, should be applied to advance environmental protection and reduce environmental risks.
- Communication and consultation among all applicable parties should be comprehensive, complete and timely.
2. Reclamation Planning
- Every mine should, at all times, have a mine closure and reclamation plan, which includes measures to be taken in the event of a temporary closure.
- The direct closure impact of all components of a mine site should be addressed as an integral part of the design criteria during the detailed engineering phase of the project, including tailings handling, disposal of chemicals and hydrocarbons and pit shutdown.
- The selection of key reclamation and closure alternatives should be based on current and comprehensive technical information generated by experts, such as competent, credible consultants.
- Mine closure and reclamation plans should be sufficiently flexible to allow adjustments as the life of the mine progresses, including the flexibility to adapt to new and improved technologies and methodologies, and allowing for progressive reclamation, while ensuring obligations under the plans are met.
3. Post-Closure Responsibilities
- Following mine closure, mining companies or their future owners should continue to be responsible for the site, including the remediation of any additional environmental complications which develop.
4. Financial Security
- The total financial security for final reclamation required at any time during the life of the mine should be equal to the total outstanding reclamation liability for land and water combined (calculated at the beginning of the work year, to be sufficient to cover the highest liability over that time period).
- Estimates of reclamation costs, for the purposes of financial security, should be based on the cost of having the necessary reclamation work done by a third-party contractor if the operator defaults. The estimates should also include contingency factors appropriate to the particular work to be undertaken.
- The recognized methodology for calculating reclamation costs, for the purposes of financial security, should be the RECLAIM or some other appropriate model. Consideration should be given to alternate or innovative forms of security, such as mine reclamation trusts, provided they meet certain criteria that protect the government's interests and objectives.
- Financial security requirements related to reclamation should be clearly set out in water licences, land leases and other regulatory instruments, though there may be circumstances where security requirements may be more appropriately dealt with through an agreement.
- Mining operators should be credited for approved progressive reclamation, and the value of financial security required should be adjusted in a timely fashion.
5. Regulatory Authorities
- There should be, to the extent possible, co-ordination among the various regulatory authorities sharing jurisdiction with respect to the management of lands and water to facilitate the consistent application of this Policy, particularly as it relates to the provision of financial assurance for environmental liability.
- The regulatory regime governing mine site reclamation should provide industry and stakeholders with the certainty and clarity required to accept the risks associated with mine developments.
- Status reports on the progress of mine site reclamation and revisions to plans should be required, pursuant to the relevant regulatory instruments.
Implementation Considerations
The following implementation considerations provide an explanatory framework and add detail to the principles set out above.
Mine Closure and Reclamation Plans
All proposals for a new mine must include a mine closure and reclamation plan. This is critical to the long-term future and environmental legacy of the development site. For greater efficiency, a plan should integrate the requirements associated with leasing surface rights and water licensing.
Required Standard of Reclamation
Site-specific criteria should be developed by regulators for assessing the adequacy of plans and their implementation, based on the 1994 Whitehorse Mining Initiative principle of ""returning mine sites and affected areas to viable and, wherever practicable, self-sustaining ecosystems that are compatible with a healthy environment and with human activities,"" including applicable archiving of reports, records, etc.
Where regulatory boards with jurisdiction for land and water management have developed specific guidelines and standards of environmental rehabilitation, these will be adopted for use in the applicable region.
Elements of Mine Closure and Reclamation Plans
Planning for closure, before development occurs, provides the opportunity to develop a flexible and cost-effective design, which helps ensure mine reclamation takes place and the responsibility for costs is borne by industry. It can be expected that techniques and methodology for mine site reclamation will continue to evolve with changes to our scientific understanding and technology. Therefore, approaches to mine site reclamation need to remain dynamic, and evolving ""best practices"" should be an integral component of reclamation planning.
Best practices for both regulatory and voluntary/nonregulatory efforts include policies, programs, technologies, reclamation research and other measures that have been found to be cost effective and environmentally appropriate. Best practices encompass and build on measures embodied within local, national and international initiatives.
A plan should fully address the following:
- The progressive reclamation of the site during the life of the operation, to the extent feasible, given the mining and processing methods employed.
- The removal or stabilization of any structures and workings remaining at the site after closure to ensure that, over time, they remain physically sound and are no threat to public safety.
- The design of tailings and waste rock disposal areas within accepted engineering standards for slope, stability and erosion control.
- The reclamation of the surface to meet acceptable standards.
- Meeting or exceeding currently accepted standards of water quality for drainage from the site.
- Ensuring the site is left in a condition which will minimize or eliminate long-term care and maintenance requirements.
- A cost estimate of the work required to close and reclaim the mine, for each year of the proposed operating life needs to be part of the plan. (Cost estimates should be based on the work being performed by an independent contractor in case the operator default. Estimates should include contingency factors appropriate to the particular work to be undertaken.)
- A list of contingency measures for temporary closure of the mine, outlining specific actions and their scheduling, to be taken during the temporary closure. (As temporary closure is commonly an uncertain condition, the schedule will be necessarily progressive as each week, month, season or year passes.)
- A plan for post-closure monitoring of the site including a monitoring schedule and reporting frequencies. (For a monitoring program to be meaningful, it must include provision for appropriate progressive responses which trigger action whenever exceeded, including the establishment of thresholds or the identification of changes in circumstances.)
The plan should describe detailed measures for the reclamation, closure and decommissioning of the mine including but not necessarily limited to:
- buildings and other structures;
- roads and airstrips;
- tailings disposal facilities and management;
- waste rock disposal management;
- quarries and open pits;
- petroleum and chemical storage areas and facilities;
- pipelines and electrical transmission lines;
- sewage and waste disposal areas and facilities;
- mine and site drainage systems;
- mine workings;
- mine shaft, adit and decline openings;
- site hydrology and water quality including water flows leaving the site;
- revegetation of the site where practicable;
- recycling of materials; and
- site specific requirements.
Progress Reporting on Reclamation
Status reports on the progress of mine site reclamation work should be submitted to the relevant regulatory authority periodically. Since reporting on progressive reclamation is directly related to amendments to the financial security, the timing and content of the reports should match the provisions found in each plan relating to amendments to the financial security (see Financial Security).
Status reports need not be elaborate documents, but should include basic details, such as the reclamation work performed, amount of materials moved, dollars spent and a general account of areas yet to be reclaimed.
Mine Closure and Reclamation Plan Revisions (Updates)
When revisions to mining plans require significant changes in reclamation requirements, an amendment to the plan will be required, in addition to the above described progress report. In many cases, these changes will require an environmental screening, and amendments to licences and permits through the regulatory process.
A significant component of any revision will be the evaluation of the degree to which reclamation costs will vary as a result of changes to the mining plan and the implications for the amount of financial assurance already in place.
Financial Security
A key element of the Plan is the relationship between the closure and reclamation obligations, and the financial security provided to ensure the liability for reclamation remains with the mining company. There are a number of issues relating to financial security which must be considered as part of this policy.
1. Forms of Security
Financial security for mine site reclamation for new mines must be readily convertible to cash. Such security must have the following basic criteria:
- Subject to applicable legislation and due process, it must provide the Crown with immediate, unconditional, unencumbered access to the full amount of the security.
- It must retain its full value throughout the life of the mine and if applicable, beyond.
- It must remain beyond the control of the mining company, or its creditors in the event of insolvency.
The Minister may consider new or innovative forms of security, such as reclamation trusts, provided they meet the above criteria.
2. Co-ordination Among Regulatory Agencies
Regulatory authority to require financial assurance for mine site reclamation is not contained in a single statute. On Crown-owned lands in Nunavut, DIAND has jurisdiction with respect to land leases and related security issues. For water licences, the Nunavut Water Board determines the amount of security, while the Minister of DIAND determines the form.
Since financial security has become a multi-jurisdictional issue, co-ordination is an important consideration. To ensure that financial security is most efficiently and effectively applied, DIAND will facilitate discussions between the various regulatory bodies to promote the co-ordination of financial security obligations. This will include:
- developing and updating of recognized standards, models and assumptions for calculating reclamation costs (e.g., RECLAIM model);
- ensuring that, at any given time during the life of the mine, the total financial security for mine site reclamation in place, subject to the timing of any application for credit for progressive reclamation, is equal to the total outstanding reclamation liability of the mine site, and the financial security for closure-related activities, imposed by land and water jurisdictions cumulatively, does not exceed the total reclamation cost estimates for both the land-related and water-related reclamation elements at each mine;
- ensuring that the terms, conditions and notification processes in financial security are compatible for all regulatory instruments; and
- coordinating the regulatory determinations required from each decision maker (e.g., the Minister or the Water Board) to facilitate the integration of all financial security obligations.
3. Progressive Reclamation
Ongoing reclamation throughout the life of the mine is preferable from both the environmental and financial liability perspectives. The financial security of a mining project will be adjusted to reflect progressive reclamation on the following basis:
- When ongoing reclamation work reduces the outstanding environmental liability, it will result in a reduction in the level of financial security required to be maintained.
- Credit for progressive reclamation work should be made in a timely fashion in accordance with authorities set out in the applicable legislation.
- The value of reclamation work will be based on generally accepted modelling (e.g., the RECLAIM model) and calculated as the difference between previous outstanding liabilities and estimates made of the remaining liability following the reclamation work (as opposed to actual costs, if actual costs do not fully reduce outstanding liability).
- The amount of financial security on deposit will normally increase proportionately as mining proceeds. Generally, this implies that as the mine site grows, water usage increases and the cost to restore a site expands. Accordingly, reclamation costs are usually estimated to rise over the life of the mine. However, as reclamation work is performed, the environmental liability is reduced and the financial security required may decrease proportionately.
- If, during a specific period, the value of any progressive reclamation exceeds the value of new reclamation liability created through additional mining operations, DIAND would reduce the amount of security required through the surface lease and would support an application by the mining company to the Water Board to reduce the amount of the water licence security accordingly.
- Progressive reclamation may not reduce the financial assurance required to zero. Sometimes, a residual amount is required to meet other licensing obligations.
Post-Closure Reclamation and Final Decommissioning
Near the end of production when closure is anticipated, the most recent approved plan will be the basis for final decommissioning. As reclamation work is successfully completed and environmental liability is reduced, the amount of financial assurance required will be proportionately reduced and the surplus refunded.
Where applicable, in addition to the physical aspects of closure, pertinent records should be collected, prepared and archived. These could include a survey of any underground workings, drill cores and broader environmental data and reports.
Once the reclamation work required by the plan is deemed completed, the site will be allowed to stabilize. During this time, monitoring will be conducted by the company and verified by DIAND and other agencies as appropriate, with respect to the effectiveness of the mitigative measures, the accuracy of the environmental assessment and any unforeseen environmental impacts. The duration of the required monitoring phase will be reviewed and confirmed at the time of closure and will depend on the risks associated with the potential impacts on the environment.
During this period, the mining company will continue to be responsible for the site, including remediation of any additional environmental complications which develop. If warranted by site conditions, the monitoring period may be extended to ensure remedial measures are met.
Some mines are anticipated to require long-term care and maintenance after closure.
Examples include sites where:
- acid mine drainage requires neutralization by water treatment;
- tailings containment structures require periodic monitoring and maintenance; and
- remediation technologies are not proven.
The Minister may hold back an appropriate amount of financial assurance to cover future requirements for the site. In such cases, the mining company will be responsible for the care and maintenance of the site, but will also maintain a claim to any remaining financial assurance.
When the Minister is satisfied the operator has met the requirements for decommissioning under the relevant legislation and that the objectives of the plan have been fully met, the Minister will provide the mining company with a written acknowledgement to that effect.
Transition Rules for Existing Mines
This Policy covers existing mining operations. However, it is recognized that the status of reclamation planning and the degree of financial assurance in effect varies considerably from mine to mine. Therefore, the application of certain aspects of this Policy will have to take into account the specific situation and issues of individual mines on a case-by-case basis.
For existing operations, the financial security provided to the Minister for reclamation obligations should be increased in increments to 100 percent coverage as soon as possible, but not later than the forecast life of the mine. Only when a mine operator could conclusively demonstrate that it was financially incapable of doing so, and the Minister was satisfied that it was in the public's best interests, would the Minister consider options relating to the form, amount or schedule for the provision of financial security.
All new reclamation liabilities created by future operations would be subject to the same requirement to provide full security as new mines.
Insolvencies
The issue of what happens when the operators of existing mines become insolvent poses a distinct and unique challenge to both the regulatory system and the application of this Policy. When a mine operator seeks court protection from creditors under either the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act or the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, the company does so with the intent to negotiate with its creditors a financial restructuring that will allow the company to emerge from court protection as a viable entity. When this process is successful, the mine operator remains liable for the closure and reclamation of the mine.
However, when this process is not successful, the creditors of the company will frequently have the court appoint a receiver or Interim Receiver under the provisions of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act to sell the assets of the company. The negotiations with prospective purchasers of a mine within insolvency proceedings will frequently involve DIAND as the representative of the Crown, as a creditor of the insolvent operator and as an environmental regulator. While DIAND will be as co-operative as possible in trying to facilitate such a sale, the Crown will not compromise or assume environmental liability to facilitate a sale of a mine for the benefit of creditors.
When a property is abandoned by a receiver, Interim Receiver, or Trustee in bankruptcy, DIAND will take any measures necessary to safeguard human health and safety, and the environment, using the authority of the Minister under the Northwest Territories Waters Act . Under this Act, the costs of such measures will be recovered from the financial security provided by the operator. Should these costs exceed the value of the security provided by the operator, the excess becomes a debt due to the Crown which, under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act, and the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act is secured by a first charge over the property. If the property is subsequently sold, the Crown intends to recover any debts due to the Crown from the proceeds of the sale ofthe property.
When a mine operator is insolvent and a mine is abandoned by a receiver, Interim Receiver or Trustee in bankruptcy, because the unsecured environmental liabilities exceed the economic value of the mine, which means the property cannot be sold in a conventional sale, DIAND would consider entering into a transaction with a purchaser for the mine on the following basis:
- The sale would generate the maximum benefit to the Crown in terms of reducing the net liability remaining with the Crown.
- Any significant consideration related to the transaction would be paid into a trust fund for the remediation of the existing environmental liabilities at the site.
- A purchaser would have its liability for the existing environmental condition of the property limited.
- A portion of the economic value of the production from the mine would go to a fund for the remediation of the existing environmental liabilities at the site.
- The purchaser would remain fully liable for the remediation costs of any environmental impact resulting from its operations at the site.
- Whether or not DIAND entered into such a transaction would depend on the extent of the benefits or potential benefits to the Crown in reducing the environmental impacts and ultimate cost to Canadian taxpayers of environmental remediation at the mine site.
Policy Review
The political and legislative environment in the North is in a period of unprecedented change. If this Policy is to keep pace with the shifting operational environment, and political, legislative and technological developments, it must be a living document, or it will lose its currency and effectiveness.
To this end, the Department will undertake to review this Policy periodically.

- . Arctic and Northern Policy Framework: Safety, security, and defence chapter
ᐃᓄᒃᑎᑐᑦ
In the Arctic and in the North, as in the rest of Canada, safety, security and defence are essential prerequisites for healthy communities, strong economies, and a sustainable environment. This chapter of the Arctic and Northern Policy Framework lays out the objectives and activities that the Government of Canada will pursue through to 2030 as part of its commitment to a safe, secure, and well-defended Arctic and North, and as a continued expression of Canada's enduring sovereignty over our lands and waters.
Canada's Arctic and Northern governments and communities are at the heart of security in the region. Partnership, cooperation and shared leadership are essential to promoting security in this diverse, complex and expansive area. Working in partnership with trusted international allies and all levels of government, including Indigenous communities, organizations and governments, Canada will continue to protect the safety and security of the people in the Arctic and the North, now and into the future.
The Arctic and Northern security environment
There is growing international interest and competition in the Canadian Arctic from state and non-state actors who seek to share in the region's rich natural resources and strategic position. This comes at a time where climate change, combined with advancements in technology, has made access to the region easier. While the Canadian Arctic has historically been — and continues to be — a region of stability and peace, growing competition and increased access brings safety and security challenges to which Canada must be ready to respond.
Climate change and increasing accessibility of the Arctic and Northern regions
Climate change is having far-reaching effects on the lives and well-being of Northerners. Extreme weather events, such as intense storms, wildfires, and floods are occurring more often and with greater severity. These events not only pose an immediate threat to the lives and property of Northerners, but can also impact the security of communities more broadly by severing the crucial transportation and communication links on which Northerners depend. Other climate change effects, including increasingly unpredictable weather patterns, melting permafrost, and changing sea ice conditions, can have an impact on food security, make transportation and travel more difficult, and endanger the stability and functioning of delicate ecosystems.
The remoteness of Arctic and Northern communities also poses a challenge with regard to critical infrastructure (CI) and emergency management (EM) considerations, which are likely to be exacerbated due to climate change. Melting ice could contribute to an increase in search and rescue requirements within the North. As such, monitoring capabilities of ice conditions and icebergs will need to be augmented to support the increased marine traffic through Northern waterways and to proactively limit EM response requests through cohesive mitigation and prevention efforts. CI requirements will increasingly need to consider a changing demographic and environment to ensure continued provision of essential services and capabilities. Specifically, robust CI is required in order to support communications, EM and military capabilities, and safe transportation within the region.
Arctic Maritime traffic
Every year, more ships, including large government research vessels and commercial cargo vessels, navigate Northern waters. In 2017, more than 190 vessels undertook 385 reported voyages through the Canadian Arctic, a 22% increase over 2016
Tourism vessels are also not uncommon in the Canadian Arctic. In 2016, Northerners saw the first transit of a modern, 1000-passenger, foreign-based cruise ship through the entire Northwest Passage.
Although the warming of the Arctic and the North offers economic opportunities, which would bring much needed socio-economic development, employment and infrastructure investments that are acutely lacking in the region, higher levels of activity could bring the potential for damage to unique ecosystems and may also increase the risks associated with increased movement of people and goods, the pursuit of interests by foreign state and non-state actors in Canada's Arctic and northern territory, and human-induced disasters. It is not difficult to imagine, for example, how a naturally-occurring or human-induced disaster in the Arctic Archipelago would place tremendous strain on the capacities of all levels of government, as well as on local communities, to support affected people and minimize the damage to affected wildlife, infrastructure, and ecosystems.
Growing international interest in the Arctic
While Canada sees no immediate threat in the Arctic and the North, as the region's physical environment changes, the circumpolar North is becoming an area of strategic international importance, with both Arctic and non-Arctic states expressing a variety of economic and military interests in the region. As the Arctic becomes more accessible, these states are poised to conduct research, transit through, and engage in more trade in the region. Given the growing international interest and competition in the Arctic, continued security and defence of Canada's Arctic requires effective safety and security frameworks, national defence, and deterrence.
In particular, easier access to the Arctic may contribute to greater foreign presence in Canadian Arctic waterways. On this matter, Canada remains committed to exercising its sovereignty, including in the various waterways commonly referred to as the Northwest Passage.
Similarly, Canada's Arctic and natural resources are attracting interest from foreign states and enterprises. Foreign investment, research, and science have the potential to improve the lives of Northerners. However, some of these investments and related economic activities could seek to advance interests that may be in opposition to those of Canada. Recognizing that economic growth and investment in the Arctic supports good jobs, healthy people and strong communities, there are also security risks associated with these investments that could impact the well-being of Northerners. Canada will continue to balance needed economic development while ensuring that security in the Arctic and the North is maintained.
While the circumpolar Arctic can and should continue to benefit from a deeply ingrained culture of international cooperation, this cooperation must not result in complacency at a time of increased interest and competition from both Arctic and non-Arctic states who see the region's political, economic, scientific, strategic and military potential. In some cases, states with interests in the Arctic are using a broad range of military capabilities and other state-controlled assets as they work to collect intelligence and position themselves to access or control sensitive sites, infrastructure, and strategic resources — potentially under the appearance of productive activities. In addition, rapid changes in military and strategic technologies including remotely-piloted systems, as well as the rise of competition in new domains such as space, artificial intelligence, and cyber, are likely to have a significant impact on the way states pursue their interests, and gives them the ability to project military force in the Arctic and North America. The long-term objectives of some of these states remain unclear, and their interests may not always align with our own.
Canada's interest is to maintain the long-standing peace and stability in the region. While Canada is open to cooperation with other states regarding the Arctic, our security priority will always be the protection of Northerners and our broader national interests against competing interests.
Taken together, the opportunities, challenges, increased competition, and risks created by a more accessible Arctic require a greater presence of security organizations, strengthened emergency management, effective military capability, and improved situational awareness. Meeting these demands necessitates a collaborative approach among all levels of government, as well as with Northerners, including Indigenous peoples, and in cooperation with the private sector where relevant to ensure that the region can prosper and that it continues to be a zone of peace and cooperation.
Goal: The Canadian Arctic and North and its people are safe, secure, and well-defended
One of the primary objectives of the Government of Canada is to protect the safety and security of Northerners and safeguard the ability to defend both the Canadian Arctic and North America now and into the future. To meet this goal the Government of Canada will continue to advance the following objectives:
- Strengthen Canada's cooperation and collaboration with domestic and international partners on safety, security and defence issues
- Enhance Canada's military presence as well as prevent and respond to safety and security incidents in the Arctic and the North
- Strengthen Canada's domain awareness, surveillance, and control capabilities in the Arctic and the North
- Enforce Canada's legislative and regulatory frameworks that govern transportation, border integrity, and environmental protection in the Arctic and the North
- Increase the whole-of-society emergency management capabilities in Arctic and Northern communities
- Support community safety through effective and culturally-appropriate crime prevention initiatives and policing services
This approach is needed to secure Canada's wider interests in the region, and to protect the people and communities who call the Canadian Arctic home.
Objective 1: Strengthen Canada's cooperation and collaboration with domestic and international partners on safety, security and defence issues
The complexity of the Arctic security environment places a premium on collaboration between all levels of government, local and Indigenous communities and peoples, and trusted international partners. Keeping pace with the evolving safety, security, and defence challenges facing the Arctic and its peoples requires improving the ways we work together.
Domestic partnerships
To further our collective ability to operate and respond to the unique safety and security challenges in the Arctic, safety and security organizations at all levels will continue to work together to identify common priorities, synchronize planning, and enhance our interoperability, including in fora such as the Arctic Security Working Group.
Operation NANOOK — Canada's signature domestic Arctic operation — reinforces the Canadian Armed Forces as a key partner in Arctic safety and security. Through Operation NANOOK, the Canadian Armed Forces delivers training, develops partnerships, and helps improve the readiness of federal, territorial, Indigenous, and municipal partners, as well as international partners. The Canadian Armed Forces also shares a number of facilities with local and federal partners, including a state-of-the-art cold-weather training facility in Resolute Bay, Nunavut, and Natural Resources Canada's Polar Continental Shelf Program. Going forward, the Canadian Armed Forces will continue to use Operation NANOOK and shared facilities to foster a collaborative approach to addressing Arctic safety, security, and defence challenges.
Canadian Rangers
Canadian Rangers, a component of the Canadian Armed Forces Reserves, is the Canadian Armed Forces' 'eyes and ears' in the Arctic and in the North. Its primary role is to provide a military presence in those sparsely settled Northern, coastal, and isolated areas of Canada which are not otherwise served by the Canadian Armed Forces.
The Canadian Armed Forces will also continue to deepen its extensive relationships with Indigenous governments, organizations and Northern communities, and will continue to engage with local populations as a routine part of its Arctic operations and exercises. For example, the Canadian Armed Forces will continue to enhance training and the operational effectiveness of the Canadian Rangers so that they can better contribute and respond to safety and security incidents, strengthen domain awareness, and express Canadian sovereignty. The Government of Canada also attaches great value to the Junior Canadian Ranger program, as it provides opportunities for youth in remote Arctic and Northern communities to build and share traditional and other life skills in remote and isolated communities throughout the Arctic and North, and across Canada.
Likewise, Transport Canada, the Canadian Coast Guard, Environment and Climate Change Canada, and the Canadian Hydrographic Service of the Department of Fisheries and Oceans will work with territorial, provincial, and Indigenous governments to build partnerships to collaboratively manage shipping in the Arctic and the North. Together, partners will identify Northern Low-Impact Shipping Corridors, and develop a governance framework to promote safer marine transportation in the North and ensure the provision of essential services to Arctic and Northern communities while respecting the environment.
International cooperation
Just as partnerships at the domestic level are critical to ensuring the safety and security of Canada's Arctic, it is equally important to work with other Arctic states and international partners in the broader region. Through the Arctic Council's Emergency Prevention, Preparedness, and Response Working Group, for instance, a number of federal government departments collaborate with other Arctic states on how best to address natural or human-induced disasters. As a signatory to the Agreement on Cooperation on Aeronautical and Maritime Search and Rescue in the Arctic, Canada is also actively working alongside the other seven Arctic states to strengthen air and maritime search and rescue. Recognizing the shared challenge posed by search and rescue in the Arctic, this agreement, signed in 2011, coordinates international search and rescue coverage and response in the Arctic, and establishes the area of responsibility of each state. This agreement is one of many that Canada is a signatory to, which highlights the continued importance of international cooperation and our ability to comprehensively respond to incidents.
Building on this essential international cooperation, the Canadian Coast Guard is an active participant in the Arctic Coast Guard Forum, an independent, informal, and operationally-driven organization comprised of representatives from all Arctic states. The Forum is intended to foster safe, secure, and environmentally responsible maritime activity in the Arctic, and provide a venue for information sharing and joint exercises on issues including search and rescue and environmental response. Through this unique forum, the Canadian Coast Guard will continue to share best practices and Canadian expertise with its counterparts, while also supporting the broader environmental protection and sustainable development goals of the Arctic Council.
As the Arctic makes up a large portion of the air and maritime approaches to North America, Canada will continue to work in close partnership with the United States to ensure that we remain secure in North America by being positioned to deter and defend against threats to the continent, including from our Northern approaches. The binational North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), and the strong relationships fostered through the Tri-Command structure which includes NORAD, Canadian Joint Operations Command, and United States Northern Command, remain as relevant for continental defence today. Canada remains firmly committed to modernizing NORAD with the United States to meet current and future threats to North America, as outlined in the Joint Statement from President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, in February 2017.
Canada and its Arctic partners share many of the same challenges in the Arctic, which provides an opportunity to leverage each other's efforts in support of our common security. Through fora such as the Arctic Security Forces Roundtable, Canada will continue to work with Arctic and non-Arctic allies and partners to foster information-sharing, improve situational awareness, and enhance operational cooperation on a broad range of Arctic and regional issues.
Canada will also continue to work with the United States and Denmark — our eastern and western neighbours — and explore opportunities to collaborate with fellow NATO member Norway to increase surveillance and monitoring of the broader Arctic region. More broadly, as stated in Strong, Secure, Engaged: Canada's Defence Policy, Canada will seek opportunities to work with allies and partners, including with NATO, in support of our common commitment to security in the Arctic. As part of this commitment, the Canadian Armed Forces will increase its participation in regional multinational exercises and seek opportunities to incorporate key Arctic and non-Arctic allies and partners in joint activities in Canada's Arctic, including Operation NANOOK. Canada will also continue to develop science and technology partnerships with trusted partners in the fields of security and defence.
Objective 2: Enhance Canada's military presence as well as prevent and respond to safety and security incidents in the Arctic and the North
The Canadian Armed Forces
The Government of Canada is already taking steps to increase its Arctic and Northern footprint in support of regional safety and security. This effort is anchored in Canada's defence policy, Strong, Secure, Engaged, whichrecognizes that the Arctic region is of critical importance to the national security and defence of Canada and of North America. Strong, Secure, Engaged meets the need to enhance the Canadian Armed Forces' presence in the region over the long term by setting out the capability investments that will give the Canadian Armed Forces the mobility, reach, and footprint required to project force in the region in ways that defend our national interests and sovereignty, and better respond to the needs of those residing in Arctic and Northern communities. Strong, Secure, Engaged, committed a number of key investments in the Arctic and the North, including six ice-capable Arctic Offshore Patrol Vessels, which are a part of the National Shipbuilding Strategy, all-terrain vehicles optimized for use in the Arctic environment, and space situational awareness to enhance and improve communications throughout Canada's Arctic region. These initiatives and investments are a small sampling of the various activities being carried out by the Canadian Armed Forces to defend Canada's Arctic and North. A comprehensive account of all Canadian Armed Force's activities in the Arctic can be found in Canada's defence policy Strong, Secure, Engaged.
Adapting to the evolving security environment will require a multi-pronged effort. At the operational level, the Canadian Armed Forces will continue to build and maintain its ability to respond in the Arctic through support for annual operations and exercises, including through a new approach to Operation NANOOK which encompasses a range of activities conducted over the course of the year. This will ensure that the Canadian Armed Forces is better able to demonstrate a persistent presence in the Arctic, support whole-of-government partners in delivering on their mandates in the Arctic, enhance our capacity to respond to major incidents, and increase collaboration with international Arctic Allies and partners.
By undertaking an approach to long-term planning that ensures the appropriate development of Arctic safety, security, and defence capability and infrastructure, we will be able to maintain a persistent and effective capacity to respond to incidents in the Arctic and to project and sustain force for domestic and continental defence into the future.
The Canadian Coast Guard
The Canadian Coast Guard is often the only federal presence in many areas of the Arctic and must have the capacity to protect Canada's interests in the region. Through the strategic positioning of resources and assets, targeted investments in infrastructure and the adoption of advanced vessel technology, the Canadian Coast Guard is enhancing its capacity to support Canada's safety, security, environmental, and economic interests in Northern waters.
The Canadian Coast Guard already provides ice-capable platforms to support responses to maritime safety, security, and environmental threats, and often partners with other departments, agencies, and organizations as they carry out their respective mandates. Through the Government of Canada's Oceans Protection Plan, the Canadian Coast Guard has extended its icebreaking season in the Arctic to ensure safe marine shipping and promote economic growth. As part of this effort, the Coast Guard has acquired 3 interim medium icebreakers, which will be operational in 2020–21, while additional vessels will be built under the National Shipbuilding Strategy.
Transport Canada
Transport Canada plays an important role in the Arctic through its National Aerial Surveillance Program, and is a key contributor in protecting Canada's interests in the region. With the investment of new infrastructure in the Arctic (a new Arctic hangar and accommodations unit), Transport Canada will continue to support Canada's safety, security, environmental, and economic interests in Northern waters. Transport Canada currently provides aircraft to monitor shipping activities, ice conditions and marine security, including environmental threats. Transport Canada also shares information with other departments, agencies, and organizations as they carry out their respective mandates.
Transport Canada continues to work on the remotely piloted aircraft system (RPAS) project as a means of enhancing its airborne maritime monitoring and other capabilities. The RPAS is expected to supplement manned aircraft already patrolling the Arctic.
Advancing Arctic search and rescue
Arctic search and rescue
Search and rescue (SAR) in the Arctic is an immense and complex activity that requires a broad range of capabilities and partners working together to save lives.
- Air search and rescue is conducted by the Royal Canadian Air Force, with assistance from the Civil Air Search and Rescue Association, a national volunteer organization which provides private aircraft and trained crews. In addition, the Canadian Armed Forces is responsible for the effective operation of the coordinated aeronautical and maritime SAR system through Joint Rescue Coordination Centres. Finally, the Canadian Armed Forces also provides and coordinates the Air response for maritime SAR
- Due to its continuous monitoring of the Arctic and presence in the region, Transport Canada plays a key role in SAR. Its surveillance aircraft is often the first asset to be called upon to respond to incidents
- Maritime search and rescue is mandated to the Canadian Coast Guard, and supported by the Canadian Coast Guard Auxiliary, a volunteer organization with more than 200 members and 25 vessels.
- Ground search and rescue is a collaborative effort between territorial and provincial governments and agencies, and the federal government. It is most often coordinated by the jurisdictional police service, and can involve collaboration with the Royal Canadian Air Force or the Canadian Rangers of the Canadian Armed Forces.
- Public Safety Canada is leading the development of a strategic policy framework for Canada's search and rescue community to ensure integrated governance across all regions of Canada, including the Arctic
The Canadian Coast Guard is increasing its maritime search and rescue capacity in the North in partnership with Indigenous communities. Through the Oceans Protection Plan, it is expanding the Arctic Canadian Coast Guard Auxiliary and extending its Indigenous Community Boat Volunteer Pilot Program. These measures will complement the recent creation of the first Arctic Inshore Rescue Boat station in Rankin Inlet, which will allow the Canadian Coast Guard to more effectively respond to marine emergencies. Finally, through the community boats program, Cambridge Bay, Rankin Inlet, Gjoa Haven, and Ulukhaktok will receive funding to purchase search and rescue boats and equipment. The Canadian Coast Guard will continue to undertake risk assessments in coastal Arctic communities to ensure that maritime search and rescue needs can be met, now and into the future.
In support of one of its core missions, the Canadian Armed Forces is investing in a replacement for the Fixed-Wing Search and Rescue aircraft which will bolster the Royal Canadian Air Force's ability to respond to critical air search and rescue, in partnership with civilian partners. The Canadian Armed Forces also continues to build its ability to respond in the Arctic and the North through the conduct of operations and exercises, including refinement and exercising of Exercise READY SOTERIA, which corresponds to the scenario of a Major Air Disaster. With the acquisition of a fleet of Arctic and Offshore Patrol Vessels, the Royal Canadian Navy will be better positioned to support partners, including the Canadian Coast Guard, in undertaking Arctic activities.
Finally, recognizing that a better understanding of activity in the Arctic is critical to search and rescue abilities, Public Safety Canada will continue to work with search and rescue partners, including Northern communities and peoples, to encourage the use of standardized location devices and technologies to ensure that responders are able to receive distress signals across a common frequency.
Border security
Another important element in addressing the evolving safety and security realities in the Arctic is to ensure the integrity of our Northern borders and facilitate legitimate travel. To this end, the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) will run pilot programs in the Arctic, including Private Vessel Remote Clearance, to support the clearance process for certain non-commercial pleasure craft seeking to enter Canada in the eastern regions of the Arctic. It will also launch the Arctic Shipping Electronic Commercial Clearance Pilot, which is an alternate clearance process for commercial vessels.
As Canada's lead for border management and border enforcement, the CBSA will work with a wide range of partners to co-develop and co-implement timely, relevant and sustainable services at an increasing number of points of service (e.g. deep water ports, airports, marine vessel transits) in a dynamic risk environment. Although CBSA is responsible for managing border security at specified ports of entry, the RCMP is responsible for securing Canada's borders between those ports and is the designated body for enforcing immigration and customs legislation in the North when and where there is an absence of other enforcement bodies.
Objective 3: Strengthen Canada's domain awareness, surveillance, and control capabilities in the Arctic and the North
Made up of more than 162,000 km of coastline, and comprising 75% of Canada's overall coastline and 40% of Canada's landmass, the Canadian Arctic poses unique challenges for building and maintaining a comprehensive picture of what is happening across this vast domain. Our ability to respond to regional challenges, provide security, and enforce compliance with our laws and regulations largely depends on our ability to put this picture together, as gaps can have life-threatening consequences. For example, increased maritime and cross-border traffic creates new challenges for border enforcement and effective vessel tracking. This is why it is critical for departments, agencies, communities and others to work together to develop strong domain awareness by collecting and synthesizing information from multiple sources.
Addressing critical gaps in situational awareness across the vast expanses of Canada's Arctic and North, and ensuring service levels are commensurate with growing demands, will also be essential to support missions-critical decision-making and strategic planning in the region. In particular, many safety, security and defence efforts in the Arctic and the North are reliant on sound weather, water, ice, and climate information, alerting and warning services to help mitigate operational risks.
Marine Security Operations Centres
The Marine Security Operations Centres provide Canada with a marine security capability by identifying, assessing, and reporting on maritime activities, including in the Arctic, that represent a potential threat to the sovereignty, safety, and security of Canada and Canadians. Comprised of several federal departments and agencies responsible for marine security, the Marine Security Operation Centres enable partners to work together, share intelligence and surveillance information, and support an organized response.
Several federal partners, including the Department of National Defence and the Canadian Armed Forces, the Department of Fisheries and Oceans and the Canadian Coast Guard, Transport Canada, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Canada Border Services Agency, Environment and Climate Change Canada, and Natural Resources Canada provide the infrastructure and work together to monitor activity in the Arctic, including through Marine Security Operations Centres. These Centres are an integral component of Canada's maritime intelligence and security architecture and contribute to a whole-of-government approach to increase maritime domain awareness. These centers monitor, detect, and analyze vessel traffic and identify security-related incidents that require a response by the Government of Canada. We will also strive, in collaboration with Indigenous governments, associations, and organizations, to increase the participation of Northern and Indigenous communities in the maritime management regime. This collaboration will enhance our knowledge of vessel activities in areas of cultural and environmental importance, as well as in areas of significance to national security.
Recognizing the need to develop a clearer understanding of the region, the Government of Canada will bring together the capabilities of a broad range of assets, such as satellites, to help provide security providers and decision-makers with a clear comprehensive picture of the operating environment.
To effectively monitor and control all of Canada's territory and approaches, Canada has taken steps to increase its awareness of air traffic approaching and operating in Canada's sovereign airspace in the Arctic, including through expansion of the Canadian Air Defence Identification Zone (CADIZ) to cover the entirety of Canada's Arctic Archipelago and its approaches. Bolstering our capabilities to support continental defence in partnership with the United States, including through the modernization of NORAD and the renewal of the North Warning System, will be essential to our continued ability to detect and understand threats against North America, and to decide whether and how to respond.
As outlined in Strong, Secure, Engaged the Canadian Armed Forces will further strengthen its ability to monitor activity in the Arctic by acquiring a range of new sea, land, air, and space capabilities and integrating them into a 'system-of-systems' approach to Arctic surveillance. The Royal Canadian Air Force will acquire a fleet of 88 advanced fighter aircraft to enforce Canada's sovereignty and meet Canada's commitments to NORAD and NATO. Canada will also continue working collaboratively with NORAD to ensure that it has the capabilities and structures, including command and control, for continuous aerospace and maritime domain awareness as well as aerospace control. As new areas of potential threat are identified — including developing technologies such as remotely-piloted systems and the emergence of new space and cyber capabilities — acquiring assets such as the replacement for the upcoming RADARSAT Constellation Mission system will enhance and improve surveillance and monitoring, including throughout Canada's Arctic region. The Canadian Armed Forces will also introduce a number of Arctic Offshore Patrol Vessels, which provide armed, sea-borne surveillance of Canadian waters in the Arctic.
Advanced research and development, including through the All Domain Situational Awareness Science and Technology (S&T) Program, and the Innovation for Defence Excellence and Security (IDEaS) program, will further contribute to meeting the Canadian Armed Forces' need for cutting-edge surveillance and communication solutions designed for the challenging Arctic environment. Safeguarding investments made in these essential technologies from unfriendly foreign activities such as theft and sabotage is a priority for Canada.
Objective 4: Enforce Canada's legislative and regulatory frameworks in the Arctic and North
Transportation in Canadian Arctic waters is subject to robust legislative and regulatory frameworks designed to protect both people and the environment. Given the rise of maritime traffic in the Arctic, ensuring the proper regulation of vessels transiting through or operating in our waters is a growing priority for Canada. In this context, a number of legislative mechanisms regulate shipping, including: the Marine Transportation Security Act; the Canada Shipping Act, 2001; the Marine Liability Act; and the Arctic Waters Pollution Prevention Act. All three provide a range of recourse to address risks associated with safety and security in the region. Another important development is the 2017 introduction of the Arctic Shipping Safety and Pollution Prevention Regulations which address ship safety and pollution prevention, incorporate the Polar Code, and represent the most significant change to Canada's Arctic shipping regime in a decade. As the operating environment evolves, the Government of Canada will continue to enforce our laws and regulations to ensure safe, secure, and environmentally sound vessel operations, and to stop unsafe vessels from operating in the Arctic.
Additionally, the Northern Canada Vessel Traffic Services Zone Regulations (NORDREG) help track vessels operating in Canadian waters to ensure safe and efficient navigation and protection of the marine environment. With expanding tourism and cruise ship activity in the region, including possible stops in Northern communities, Transport Canada will continue to work with Arctic communities to bring their marine infrastructure into compliance with the Marine Transportation Security Act and other regulations. The Government of Canada will ensure that our legislative and regulatory frameworks remain adapted to the realities of increasing levels of Arctic traffic, and the potential impacts on the region's people and communities.
Effective laws and regulations are also key in ensuring that foreign investment in the Arctic benefits Northerners and does not pose a threat to Canada's security. This legal and regulatory framework supports economic growth and increased investments in the regions, while ensuring that foreign economic activity in the Arctic does not compromise national security. While we look to develop much-needed infrastructure in the Arctic, risks and opportunities posed by foreign activity in areas of strategic importance will need to be carefully considered and balanced. Knowing that safe and sustainable communities free from potentially damaging external influence or behaviours are the foundation of a healthy Northern economy, the Government of Canada will also enhance protections for sensitive sites and infrastructures, as well as for the technologies on which the Canadian Armed Forces and other federal security providers depend.
Objective 5: Increase whole-of-society emergency management capabilities in Arctic and Northern communities
A key pillar of the Arctic safety and security architecture is incorporated in Canada's Emergency Management Strategy, which is the result of federal, provincial, and territorial efforts to establish complementary approaches to emergency management. Recognizing that emergency requirements are constantly changing, there is a need for collaboration amongst all areas of society to enhance community safety and resilience. As part of ongoing efforts to improve the way we prevent, mitigate, prepare for, respond to, and recover from emergencies, partners are working to strengthen federal, provincial and territorial Emergency Management governance and enhance the participation of Indigenous representatives in this work.
Objective 6: Support community safety through effective and culturally-appropriate crime prevention initiatives and policing services
As Arctic and Northern communities continue to face particular challenges that contribute to higher levels of crime, culturally-sensitive crime prevention programs and community safety planning initiatives are essential. Through the Aboriginal Community Safety Planning Initiative, Public Safety Canada will continue to support Indigenous and Northern communities to develop community safety plans that address issues identified by the community, as specific to their unique vulnerabilities and circumstances. In addition, the National Crime Prevention Strategy will continue to deliver culturally-sensitive crime prevention programming and support initiatives to prevent and reduce crime in Indigenous and Northern communities. Through funding programs such as the Northern and Aboriginal Crime Prevention Fund and the Crime Prevention Action Fund, the Government of Canada will continue to collaborate with its partners to support and promote safe, strong, and resilient communities. The Gun and Gang Violence Action Fund was also developed with the recognition that provinces and territories — working closely with Arctic and Northern communities — are best placed to identify their most pressing issues related to gun and gang violence and develop initiatives to address them. As such, this Fund allows jurisdictions the flexibility to use these resources for a range of enforcement and prevention-related activities, including tailored initiatives that are adapted to Arctic and Northern realities.
The RCMP also has a key role in securing Canada's Arctic by providing policing services. Increasing international interest and activity in the Arctic could lead to escalating organized crime activity, irregular migration, human smuggling, and national security threats. To help respond, through Territorial Police Service Agreements, there is a large RCMP presence in the Northern Territories to help protect Arctic and Northern communities and ensure the safety of Northerners. The RCMP's presence in the Arctic includes 61 detachments and 3 Divisional headquarters. As the contracted police service, RCMP plays a critical role in providing first response to civil emergencies and national security threats.
As more commercial ventures, such as the Iqaluit deep water port, and people become established in the region, the demand for illicit goods is likely to increase. Higher profit margins for drugs in the Arctic, compared to in southern provinces, have attracted criminal networks. The RCMP's primary priority across the northern territories is to maintain safe and secure communities. The RCMP conducts traditional boots-on-the-ground policing, while focusing on delivering the highest quality service, which includes developing community capacity to prevent crime through social development initiatives and criminal intelligence collection. Criminal intelligence serves to assist the RCMP in preventing, deterring, and detecting criminal activity that may pose a threat to the safety and security of Canada.

Mine Site Reclamation Policy for Nunavut
A policy for the protection of the environment and the disposition of liability relating to mine closures in Nunavut.
I am pleased to present the Mine Site Reclamation Policy for Nunavut. This policy reflects the Government of Canada's desire to ensure a strong resource management base in Nunavut while reducing the impacts to the environment and human health.
The development of this policy has included a broad-based consultation process involving representatives from Aboriginal organizations, industry, stakeholders, Northern boards and the territorial governments.
Sustainable resource development is essential to the North. Our objective is to strengthen federal standards for both the protection of the environment and the reclamation of mine sites. Through this policy we are establishing a clear standard and are providing clarity and certainty for industry and other stakeholders which will lead to sustainable and responsible development in the North.
I would like to acknowledge and thank all those who have contributed to the development of this policy. We must continue to work together to create an industry that is sustainable, profitable and environmentally responsible.
Sincerely,
Honourable Robert D. Nault
Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development
Introduction
For more than a hundred years, mines have been operating in Canada's North, providing important economic benefits, not only for northerners, but to all Canadians. Mining in the North has been good for Canada. A rough estimate of the cumulative value of metal and mineral production for the three territories since 1977 is over $18 billion
However, some mining operations closed without adequately addressing their clean-up and reclamation responsibilities, leaving hundreds of millions of dollars of clean-up costs to the federal government. While this represents a relatively small percentage of the economic benefit, in absolute terms, it still amounts to a substantial burden on the government's accounts.
The public is becoming more concerned about the growing number of insolvencies and abandoned mining properties, which are leaving significant environmental liabilities. This increased consciousness on the issue has led to out ward expressions of concern and questioning of support for mining in the North.
On April 1, 1999, Canada created the new territory of Nunavut and, with it, the expectation that Inuit would become the managers of their own destiny. This includes unprecedented participation in the management of their renewable and non-renewable resources. In essence, the creation of Nunavut has given the Inuit a ""clean slate"" to develop the kind of resource management regime they want to take with them into the new millennium. To this end, there have already been strong signals that the development of a comprehensive resource management program, particularly for mining, is a high priority.
The Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development (DIAND) is concerned with the public's eroding confidence in northern mining. It also recognizes the desire to build a strong resource management base in Nunavut. both complement DIAND's thinking and its ongoing search for opportunities responsibilities are carried out across Canada's three northern territories.
DIAND considers the Mine Site Reclamation Policy for Nunavut an important new step in the development of a comprehensive mineral resource management component of the Department's Sustainable Development Strategy.
The development of the Policy was not the only option available. Government continues to look at various legislative and regulatory initiatives to support the principles set out in this Policy. However, legislative and regulatory changes take a relatively long time to accomplish, and it is important to deal with this issue in the context of current legislation from the perspective of operating mines preparing to close in the next few years and new mines expected to open shortly.
It is critical to have resource management tools in place in Nunavut before new mineral development activities become too far advanced. Industry, investors, environmental interests and communities all share the desire for certainty, consistency and clarity.
The Mine Site Reclamation Policy for Nunavut serves four main objectives:
- Ensure the impact of mining on the environment and human health and safety is minimized.
- Reduce the environmental liability that falls to government to the greatest extent possible.
- Provide industry and the public with a clear signal of the government's expectations.
- Build positive and supportive relationships with the new regulatory authorities coming into operation in the North.
DIAND also recognizes that many of the provisions incorporated within this Policy are governmental ""principles"" that provide general guidance and direction. They work in harmony with the existing regulatory framework and the regulators charged with their application. It is not the intent of this Policy to supplant or diminish these existing regulatory authorities or the organizations that have been created to carry them out.
DIAND has been guided by The Minerals and Metals Policy of the Government of Canada, wherein specific reference is made to the challenges associated with mine site reclamation and the federal government's direct responsibilities in the three territories.
It should also be noted that DIAND is developing another complementary policy that relates to orphaned or abandoned sites, including mines. It is called the Policy on the Management of Contaminated Sites in Canada's North. This proposed policy is part of DIAND's commitment to reduce or eliminate the human health and safety dangers posed by contaminated sites, including abandoned mines.
In addition to legislation governing conventional mining, the mining of uranium and other related hazardous minerals is regulated by specific legislation (e.g., The Nuclear Safety and Control Act).
This Policy is intended to be consistent with the legislative, regulatory and policy instruments currently in effect in Nunavut, including the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement.
The Policy offers guidance for the planning and implementation of mine site reclamation in Nunavut. To a large degree, the principles outlined in this Policy have already been adopted and adhered to by the federal government and industry, within the existing regulatory framework in Nunavut. This Policy codifies, clarifies and provides more certainty. It gives a template for the development and enhancement of operational procedures and processes required to ensure that objectives are met.
Enforcement of regulatory provisions related to mine site reclamation will continue to be undertaken through the existing regulatory regime. The Territorial Lands Act and its regulations, the Northwest Territories Waters Act and the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement will be the primary vehicles used, although other pieces of federal and territorial legislation are also in play (e.g., Fisheries Act, Canadian Environmental Protection Act and Nunavut Waters and Nunavut Surface Rights Tribunal Act).
The environmental assessment processes will continue to identify and consider the environmental, social, cultural and economic effects of a mining project and its reclamation, and ensure that the potentially affected public participates during the monitoring and reporting of mine site reclamation.
The principles and objectives laid out in this Policy will guide DIAND's decision-making powers in matters where DIAND has authority and will shape DIAND's position as an intervener in regulatory processes carried out by resource management boards.
DIAND will continue to be guided by other federal policies concerning regulatory efficiency and environmental protection. Given the number of regulatory authorities emerging in the North, it is critical that this Policy be integrated with the existing regulatory and policy framework.
Application
Given the multi-jurisdictional landscape in Nunavut, application of this Policy depends on the circumstances. It will provide internal guidance to DIAND staff in the drafting of terms and conditions of regulatory instruments, such as surface leases, over which the Department retains jurisdiction and in the preparation of interventions to the resource management boards within the territory. The Policy will also inform the resource management boards of the Minister's expectations in terms of their work and what the Minister will be looking for in the regulatory instruments submitted for the Minister's approval. Finally, it tells industry what is expected in its project designs (as it relates to reclamation planning) and what industry can expect from regulatory decision makers, thereby ""fixing the goal posts"" and removing ad hoc, case-by-case interpretations.
This Policy only applies within the jurisdiction of the federal government and, as such, does not apply to those aspects of reclamation that fall within the jurisdiction of the Government of Nunavut or the Inuit as private owners of the surface of land through the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement. This would clearly include the nonwater-related aspects of surface reclamation on lands that are either owned by the Inuit pursuant to the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement or administered by the Government of Nunavut as Commissioner's land. Mining operations, which are located on a combination of Inuit-owned and Crown lands, will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis, probably, through some form of co-operative arrangement between DIAND and the Inuit land-owning organization.
This Policy applies to new and existing mines, whether operating or not, with clearly identified owners/operators. It does not cover orphaned or abandoned sites, which will fall under the proposed Policy on the Management of Contaminated Sites in Canada's North.
The Policy applies only to developed mines and to those mining-related activities that take place on mine sites. It does not apply to activities undertaken during the prospecting, exploration or advanced exploration stages of the development of a mineral property.
This policy is virtually identical to the Mine Site Reclamation Policy for the Northwest Territories (NWT) and is intended to cover mining properties which might straddle the Northwest Territories-Nunavut border. Yukon mining activities are not managed under the Territorial Lands Act/Canada Mining Regulations, and a modified policy vehicle is being developed which is consistent with Yukon's legislative and regulatory framework. It is intended that it will complement its NWT and Nunavut counterparts, to create a consistent pan-Northern policy framework.
Principles for Mine Site Reclamation
The following principles respecting mine site reclamation should provide proponents, boards and government departments with certainty, clarity and consistency regarding expectations, from project design to operations and post-closure.
1. General
- Mine site reclamation should reflect the collective desire and commitment to operate under the principles of sustainable development, including the ""polluter pays"" principle.
- The required standard of reclamation should be based on the 1994 Whitehorse Mining Initiative definition: ""returning mine sites and affected areas to viable and, wherever practicable, selfsustaining ecosystems that are compatible with a healthy environment and with human activities.""
- Every new mining operation should be able to support the cost of reclamation. Existing mining operations will also be held accountable for their reclamation liabilities.
- Adequate security should be provided to ensure the cost of reclamation, including shutdown, closure and post-closure, is born by the operator of the mine rather than the Crown.
- Best management practices, including progressive reclamation, should be applied to advance environmental protection and reduce environmental risks.
- Communication and consultation among all applicable parties should be comprehensive, complete and timely.
2. Reclamation Planning
- Every mine should, at all times, have a mine closure and reclamation plan, which includes measures to be taken in the event of a temporary closure.
- The direct closure impact of all components of a mine site should be addressed as an integral part of the design criteria during the detailed engineering phase of the project, including tailings handling, disposal of chemicals and hydrocarbons and pit shutdown.
- The selection of key reclamation and closure alternatives should be based on current and comprehensive technical information generated by experts, such as competent, credible consultants.
- Mine closure and reclamation plans should be sufficiently flexible to allow adjustments as the life of the mine progresses, including the flexibility to adapt to new and improved technologies and methodologies, and allowing for progressive reclamation, while ensuring obligations under the plans are met.
3. Post-Closure Responsibilities
- Following mine closure, mining companies or their future owners should continue to be responsible for the site, including the remediation of any additional environmental complications which develop.
4. Financial Security
- The total financial security for final reclamation required at any time during the life of the mine should be equal to the total outstanding reclamation liability for land and water combined (calculated at the beginning of the work year, to be sufficient to cover the highest liability over that time period).
- Estimates of reclamation costs, for the purposes of financial security, should be based on the cost of having the necessary reclamation work done by a third-party contractor if the operator defaults. The estimates should also include contingency factors appropriate to the particular work to be undertaken.
- The recognized methodology for calculating reclamation costs, for the purposes of financial security, should be the RECLAIM or some other appropriate model. Consideration should be given to alternate or innovative forms of security, such as mine reclamation trusts, provided they meet certain criteria that protect the government's interests and objectives.
- Financial security requirements related to reclamation should be clearly set out in water licences, land leases and other regulatory instruments, though there may be circumstances where security requirements may be more appropriately dealt with through an agreement.
- Mining operators should be credited for approved progressive reclamation, and the value of financial security required should be adjusted in a timely fashion.
5. Regulatory Authorities
- There should be, to the extent possible, co-ordination among the various regulatory authorities sharing jurisdiction with respect to the management of lands and water to facilitate the consistent application of this Policy, particularly as it relates to the provision of financial assurance for environmental liability.
- The regulatory regime governing mine site reclamation should provide industry and stakeholders with the certainty and clarity required to accept the risks associated with mine developments.
- Status reports on the progress of mine site reclamation and revisions to plans should be required, pursuant to the relevant regulatory instruments.
Implementation Considerations
The following implementation considerations provide an explanatory framework and add detail to the principles set out above.
Mine Closure and Reclamation Plans
All proposals for a new mine must include a mine closure and reclamation plan. This is critical to the long-term future and environmental legacy of the development site. For greater efficiency, a plan should integrate the requirements associated with leasing surface rights and water licensing.
Required Standard of Reclamation
Site-specific criteria should be developed by regulators for assessing the adequacy of plans and their implementation, based on the 1994 Whitehorse Mining Initiative principle of ""returning mine sites and affected areas to viable and, wherever practicable, self-sustaining ecosystems that are compatible with a healthy environment and with human activities,"" including applicable archiving of reports, records, etc.
Where regulatory boards with jurisdiction for land and water management have developed specific guidelines and standards of environmental rehabilitation, these will be adopted for use in the applicable region.
Elements of Mine Closure and Reclamation Plans
Planning for closure, before development occurs, provides the opportunity to develop a flexible and cost-effective design, which helps ensure mine reclamation takes place and the responsibility for costs is borne by industry. It can be expected that techniques and methodology for mine site reclamation will continue to evolve with changes to our scientific understanding and technology. Therefore, approaches to mine site reclamation need to remain dynamic, and evolving ""best practices"" should be an integral component of reclamation planning.
Best practices for both regulatory and voluntary/nonregulatory efforts include policies, programs, technologies, reclamation research and other measures that have been found to be cost effective and environmentally appropriate. Best practices encompass and build on measures embodied within local, national and international initiatives.
A plan should fully address the following:
- The progressive reclamation of the site during the life of the operation, to the extent feasible, given the mining and processing methods employed.
- The removal or stabilization of any structures and workings remaining at the site after closure to ensure that, over time, they remain physically sound and are no threat to public safety.
- The design of tailings and waste rock disposal areas within accepted engineering standards for slope, stability and erosion control.
- The reclamation of the surface to meet acceptable standards.
- Meeting or exceeding currently accepted standards of water quality for drainage from the site.
- Ensuring the site is left in a condition which will minimize or eliminate long-term care and maintenance requirements.
- A cost estimate of the work required to close and reclaim the mine, for each year of the proposed operating life needs to be part of the plan. (Cost estimates should be based on the work being performed by an independent contractor in case the operator default. Estimates should include contingency factors appropriate to the particular work to be undertaken.)
- A list of contingency measures for temporary closure of the mine, outlining specific actions and their scheduling, to be taken during the temporary closure. (As temporary closure is commonly an uncertain condition, the schedule will be necessarily progressive as each week, month, season or year passes.)
- A plan for post-closure monitoring of the site including a monitoring schedule and reporting frequencies. (For a monitoring program to be meaningful, it must include provision for appropriate progressive responses which trigger action whenever exceeded, including the establishment of thresholds or the identification of changes in circumstances.)
The plan should describe detailed measures for the reclamation, closure and decommissioning of the mine including but not necessarily limited to:
- buildings and other structures;
- roads and airstrips;
- tailings disposal facilities and management;
- waste rock disposal management;
- quarries and open pits;
- petroleum and chemical storage areas and facilities;
- pipelines and electrical transmission lines;
- sewage and waste disposal areas and facilities;
- mine and site drainage systems;
- mine workings;
- mine shaft, adit and decline openings;
- site hydrology and water quality including water flows leaving the site;
- revegetation of the site where practicable;
- recycling of materials; and
- site specific requirements.
Progress Reporting on Reclamation
Status reports on the progress of mine site reclamation work should be submitted to the relevant regulatory authority periodically. Since reporting on progressive reclamation is directly related to amendments to the financial security, the timing and content of the reports should match the provisions found in each plan relating to amendments to the financial security (see Financial Security).
Status reports need not be elaborate documents, but should include basic details, such as the reclamation work performed, amount of materials moved, dollars spent and a general account of areas yet to be reclaimed.
Mine Closure and Reclamation Plan Revisions (Updates)
When revisions to mining plans require significant changes in reclamation requirements, an amendment to the plan will be required, in addition to the above described progress report. In many cases, these changes will require an environmental screening, and amendments to licences and permits through the regulatory process.
A significant component of any revision will be the evaluation of the degree to which reclamation costs will vary as a result of changes to the mining plan and the implications for the amount of financial assurance already in place.
Financial Security
A key element of the Plan is the relationship between the closure and reclamation obligations, and the financial security provided to ensure the liability for reclamation remains with the mining company. There are a number of issues relating to financial security which must be considered as part of this policy.
1. Forms of Security
Financial security for mine site reclamation for new mines must be readily convertible to cash. Such security must have the following basic criteria:
- Subject to applicable legislation and due process, it must provide the Crown with immediate, unconditional, unencumbered access to the full amount of the security.
- It must retain its full value throughout the life of the mine and if applicable, beyond.
- It must remain beyond the control of the mining company, or its creditors in the event of insolvency.
The Minister may consider new or innovative forms of security, such as reclamation trusts, provided they meet the above criteria.
2. Co-ordination Among Regulatory Agencies
Regulatory authority to require financial assurance for mine site reclamation is not contained in a single statute. On Crown-owned lands in Nunavut, DIAND has jurisdiction with respect to land leases and related security issues. For water licences, the Nunavut Water Board determines the amount of security, while the Minister of DIAND determines the form.
Since financial security has become a multi-jurisdictional issue, co-ordination is an important consideration. To ensure that financial security is most efficiently and effectively applied, DIAND will facilitate discussions between the various regulatory bodies to promote the co-ordination of financial security obligations. This will include:
- developing and updating of recognized standards, models and assumptions for calculating reclamation costs (e.g., RECLAIM model);
- ensuring that, at any given time during the life of the mine, the total financial security for mine site reclamation in place, subject to the timing of any application for credit for progressive reclamation, is equal to the total outstanding reclamation liability of the mine site, and the financial security for closure-related activities, imposed by land and water jurisdictions cumulatively, does not exceed the total reclamation cost estimates for both the land-related and water-related reclamation elements at each mine;
- ensuring that the terms, conditions and notification processes in financial security are compatible for all regulatory instruments; and
- coordinating the regulatory determinations required from each decision maker (e.g., the Minister or the Water Board) to facilitate the integration of all financial security obligations.
3. Progressive Reclamation
Ongoing reclamation throughout the life of the mine is preferable from both the environmental and financial liability perspectives. The financial security of a mining project will be adjusted to reflect progressive reclamation on the following basis:
- When ongoing reclamation work reduces the outstanding environmental liability, it will result in a reduction in the level of financial security required to be maintained.
- Credit for progressive reclamation work should be made in a timely fashion in accordance with authorities set out in the applicable legislation.
- The value of reclamation work will be based on generally accepted modelling (e.g., the RECLAIM model) and calculated as the difference between previous outstanding liabilities and estimates made of the remaining liability following the reclamation work (as opposed to actual costs, if actual costs do not fully reduce outstanding liability).
- The amount of financial security on deposit will normally increase proportionately as mining proceeds. Generally, this implies that as the mine site grows, water usage increases and the cost to restore a site expands. Accordingly, reclamation costs are usually estimated to rise over the life of the mine. However, as reclamation work is performed, the environmental liability is reduced and the financial security required may decrease proportionately.
- If, during a specific period, the value of any progressive reclamation exceeds the value of new reclamation liability created through additional mining operations, DIAND would reduce the amount of security required through the surface lease and would support an application by the mining company to the Water Board to reduce the amount of the water licence security accordingly.
- Progressive reclamation may not reduce the financial assurance required to zero. Sometimes, a residual amount is required to meet other licensing obligations.
Post-Closure Reclamation and Final Decommissioning
Near the end of production when closure is anticipated, the most recent approved plan will be the basis for final decommissioning. As reclamation work is successfully completed and environmental liability is reduced, the amount of financial assurance required will be proportionately reduced and the surplus refunded.
Where applicable, in addition to the physical aspects of closure, pertinent records should be collected, prepared and archived. These could include a survey of any underground workings, drill cores and broader environmental data and reports.
Once the reclamation work required by the plan is deemed completed, the site will be allowed to stabilize. During this time, monitoring will be conducted by the company and verified by DIAND and other agencies as appropriate, with respect to the effectiveness of the mitigative measures, the accuracy of the environmental assessment and any unforeseen environmental impacts. The duration of the required monitoring phase will be reviewed and confirmed at the time of closure and will depend on the risks associated with the potential impacts on the environment.
During this period, the mining company will continue to be responsible for the site, including remediation of any additional environmental complications which develop. If warranted by site conditions, the monitoring period may be extended to ensure remedial measures are met.
Some mines are anticipated to require long-term care and maintenance after closure.
Examples include sites where:
- acid mine drainage requires neutralization by water treatment;
- tailings containment structures require periodic monitoring and maintenance; and
- remediation technologies are not proven.
The Minister may hold back an appropriate amount of financial assurance to cover future requirements for the site. In such cases, the mining company will be responsible for the care and maintenance of the site, but will also maintain a claim to any remaining financial assurance.
When the Minister is satisfied the operator has met the requirements for decommissioning under the relevant legislation and that the objectives of the plan have been fully met, the Minister will provide the mining company with a written acknowledgement to that effect.
Transition Rules for Existing Mines
This Policy covers existing mining operations. However, it is recognized that the status of reclamation planning and the degree of financial assurance in effect varies considerably from mine to mine. Therefore, the application of certain aspects of this Policy will have to take into account the specific situation and issues of individual mines on a case-by-case basis.
For existing operations, the financial security provided to the Minister for reclamation obligations should be increased in increments to 100 percent coverage as soon as possible, but not later than the forecast life of the mine. Only when a mine operator could conclusively demonstrate that it was financially incapable of doing so, and the Minister was satisfied that it was in the public's best interests, would the Minister consider options relating to the form, amount or schedule for the provision of financial security.
All new reclamation liabilities created by future operations would be subject to the same requirement to provide full security as new mines.
Insolvencies
The issue of what happens when the operators of existing mines become insolvent poses a distinct and unique challenge to both the regulatory system and the application of this Policy. When a mine operator seeks court protection from creditors under either the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act or the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, the company does so with the intent to negotiate with its creditors a financial restructuring that will allow the company to emerge from court protection as a viable entity. When this process is successful, the mine operator remains liable for the closure and reclamation of the mine.
However, when this process is not successful, the creditors of the company will frequently have the court appoint a receiver or Interim Receiver under the provisions of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act to sell the assets of the company. The negotiations with prospective purchasers of a mine within insolvency proceedings will frequently involve DIAND as the representative of the Crown, as a creditor of the insolvent operator and as an environmental regulator. While DIAND will be as co-operative as possible in trying to facilitate such a sale, the Crown will not compromise or assume environmental liability to facilitate a sale of a mine for the benefit of creditors.
When a property is abandoned by a receiver, Interim Receiver, or Trustee in bankruptcy, DIAND will take any measures necessary to safeguard human health and safety, and the environment, using the authority of the Minister under the Northwest Territories Waters Act . Under this Act, the costs of such measures will be recovered from the financial security provided by the operator. Should these costs exceed the value of the security provided by the operator, the excess becomes a debt due to the Crown which, under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act, and the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act is secured by a first charge over the property. If the property is subsequently sold, the Crown intends to recover any debts due to the Crown from the proceeds of the sale ofthe property.
When a mine operator is insolvent and a mine is abandoned by a receiver, Interim Receiver or Trustee in bankruptcy, because the unsecured environmental liabilities exceed the economic value of the mine, which means the property cannot be sold in a conventional sale, DIAND would consider entering into a transaction with a purchaser for the mine on the following basis:
- The sale would generate the maximum benefit to the Crown in terms of reducing the net liability remaining with the Crown.
- Any significant consideration related to the transaction would be paid into a trust fund for the remediation of the existing environmental liabilities at the site.
- A purchaser would have its liability for the existing environmental condition of the property limited.
- A portion of the economic value of the production from the mine would go to a fund for the remediation of the existing environmental liabilities at the site.
- The purchaser would remain fully liable for the remediation costs of any environmental impact resulting from its operations at the site.
- Whether or not DIAND entered into such a transaction would depend on the extent of the benefits or potential benefits to the Crown in reducing the environmental impacts and ultimate cost to Canadian taxpayers of environmental remediation at the mine site.
Policy Review
The political and legislative environment in the North is in a period of unprecedented change. If this Policy is to keep pace with the shifting operational environment, and political, legislative and technological developments, it must be a living document, or it will lose its currency and effectiveness.
To this end, the Department will undertake to review this Policy periodically.

How Nunavut Map Selection works
Nunavut Map Selection is a computer system replacing ground staking of mineral claims with an online selection of mineral claims on a map of Nunavut. The new ""unit claims"" are made of a collection of contiguous units selected from a predefined grid.
What are the grid units based on
The grid of units used for map selection is described in Schedule 3 of the amended Nunavut Mining Regulations (2020). It is identical to the grid described in the Canada Oil and Gas Land Regulations. The minimum size of a claim is one unit of 15 to 25 hectares. The size depends on where the unit is located in the territory. The average size of a unit is 18 hectares. The most a user may select is 100 units. The grid used for the online map selection of claims in Nunavut is available on the Nunavut Map Viewer.
A shapefile of the grid can be downloaded from the Natural Resources Canada website or can be visualized using the Nunavut Map Viewer. The new Nunavut Map Viewer and spatial data concerning mining rights are available to the public since April 2015. The spatial data can be accessed through the open data portal.
Start date for map selection of mineral claims in Nunavut
The final deployment of the Nunavut Map Selection system is planned for January 30, 2021.
How existing mineral claims and mining leases were affected by the regulatory amendments allowing for map selection
All existing mining rights were maintained and transitory measures were put in place on November 1st 2020 when the amended Nunavut Mining Regulations, came into force.
On the 91st day (January 30, 2021) beginning on the day on which the amended regulations (2020) come into force, these regulations establish a mandatory one-time conversion of ground staked claims to grid-based claims called ""unit claims"". Unit claims are depicted on the Nunavut Map Viewer.
Claims subject to mining leases existing before January 30, 2020 will not be converted. Mining leases retain their limits as defined by the leased claim's legal plan of survey.
There is no more reduction of claims on the ground by staking using reduced area tags. The reduction of the area of existing leases of ground staked claims is not allowed anymore. However, it is possible to reduce unit claims once a year or leases of unit claims on renewal by simply removing units from the claims using the online Nunavut Map Selection system.
Why CIRNAC requires mandatory conversion and does not allow for the maintenance of existing ground staked claims
After weighing the pros and cons of an optional conversion, CIRNAC determined it would not be internally sustainable from administrative and technical points of view. Optional conversion, would require 2 regimes of mining rights administration to be maintained in parallel, one for ground claims and one for new unit claims. This would be a much more complex regulatory framework.
The approach where all ground claims are converted into unit claims simplifies the regulations while maintaining the rights of existing claim holders.
How the regulatory amendments affect prospecting permits
The amended Nunavut Mining Regulations (2020) repeal the provisions of the former Nunavut Mining Regulations (2014) related to acquiring new prospecting permits.You will no longer have the opportunity to apply for a prospecting permit.
The plan is to follow the existing prospecting permits life cycle in the former regulations (2014). This means these permits are allowed to exist until they expire, so long as the requirements of the former regulations (2014) regarding prospecting permits are satisfied. If you own a prospecting permit, you are able to select unit claims within the permit zone as long as you have confirmation that at least $0.25 per hectare of work has been done on the permit area.
How the regulatory amendments to affect licences to prospect
You still need a valid licence to prospect on Crown lands and for specific transactions on mining rights under the amended regulations (2020).
The fee for a licence to prospect remains at $5/year for an individual and $50/year for a corporation. The period of validity of a licence issued under the former regulations (2014) is maintained under the amended regulations and the licence continues to have to be renewed annually. Renewal is free of charge.
How the online Nunavut Map Selection system affects management of minerals claims, licenses to prospect and mining leases
The Nunavut Map Selection system allows users to manage their own tenures online, including licences to prospect, mineral claims and mining leases.
Most transactions continue to require approval from the Mining Recorder's Office.
Mining rights owners may assign a person to complete any specific task on their behalf.
- reports of work, which continue to be submitted to the Mining Recorder's Office by mail or in person
- the mining royalty return which continues to be sent to the Chief of Royalties Administration by mail
All authorizations, with the exception of the mining leases, are delivered through the system.
The regulatory amendments and the royalties provisions
There is no change to the royalties sections.
How the regulatory amendments affect the administrative fees (Schedule 1)
There is no added categories or increase of Schedule 1 administrative fees.
As most of the transactions on mining rights are automated, the following administrative fees are eliminated:
- duplicate licence
- claim tags
- reduced-area claim tags
- application to record a claim or reduced-area claim
- certificate of work
- application for extension to do work
- request to cancel the recording of a claim
The regulatory amendments and reporting on work requirements (Schedule 2)
No substantive amendments are made to the Schedule 2 provisions dealing with the reporting on work requirements.
The ""cost of work"" exclusion list has been modified. It now excludes the portion of cost of environmental baseline studies conducted in conjunction with geological field work that exceeds 10% of the cost of that geological work. There was no limit to the cost of environmental baseline studies that could be reported under the former regulations (2014). This change of policy aims at enhancing the collection of geological information in Nunavut.
How the regulatory amendments allowing for map selection affect the business costs
It is expected that there will be a net cost savings to implementing online map selection. Most of the savings are attributed to removing the requirement to physically stake a mineral claim.
The regulatory modifications include adjusting the cost of work requirements to account for inflation and move from a per hectare calculation to a per unit calculation of the claim size. This means that selecting a unit-based claim online requires an upfront, refundable work deposit of $45 per unit or partial unit. A full sized ground staked claim of 1,250 hectares presently equals approximately 80 units, depending on where it is located in Nunavut. This unit claim would cost $3,600, which is fully refundable upon submission of your first complete report of work at the end of year 2.
The current work rate is $10 per hectare for the first 2 years of the claim and $5 per hectare for the remaining years. The following table breaks down the new unit based work requirements for each year of the life of a claim into the equivalent per hectare rate for comparison.
|Year||Work charge rate per unit or partial unit||Per hectare work charge rate (assuming an average of 18 hectares per unit)|
|1||$45.00||$2.50|
|2||$90.00||$5.00|
|3||$90.00||$5.00|
|4||$90.00||$5.00|
|5 to 7||$135.00||$7.50|
|8 to 10||$180.00||$10.00|
|11 to 20||$225.00||$12.50|
|21 to 30||$270.00||$15.00|
The Nunavut Map Selection system and digital visualization of a claim
The amended regulations (2020) provide that all existing mining claims are converted into unit claims based on the grid on January 30, 2021, after the 90-day transition period starting when the regulations come into force on November 1st, 2020. The spatial conversion is based on the geographical coordinates that the Mining Recorder's Office previously stored for your claims. These have been digitized from the claim sketches that were submitted with your applications to record claims.
The location of your mining rights can be visualized through the Nunavut Map Viewer. It shows the official positioning of the claim on the grid. Note that under law, the only person who can determine the exact location of a mineral claim boundary on Crown lands in Nunavut is a Canada Lands Surveyor. If it is important to know the precise location of the boundary, please obtain a mineral claim survey.

PDF Version (286 Kb, 18 Pages)
The Mine Site Reclamation Policy for Nunavut was released by the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development on July 29, 2002. The policy is designed to provide a resource management tool to ensure that mining operations in Nunavut do not leave a legacy of environmental and human health hazards and a financial burden on the Canadian taxpayer. The Department considers this policy an important component in developing a strong resource management base in Nunavut. It will provide certainty and clarity concerning the government's expectations on mine site reclamation. The policy was developed after extensive consultations with Inuit organizations, industry, environmental non-government organizations, Institutions of Public Government and the Government of Nunavut.

Mine Site Reclamation Policy for Nunavut
A policy for the protection of the environment and the disposition of liability relating to mine closures in Nunavut.
I am pleased to present the Mine Site Reclamation Policy for Nunavut. This policy reflects the Government of Canada's desire to ensure a strong resource management base in Nunavut while reducing the impacts to the environment and human health.
The development of this policy has included a broad-based consultation process involving representatives from Aboriginal organizations, industry, stakeholders, Northern boards and the territorial governments.
Sustainable resource development is essential to the North. Our objective is to strengthen federal standards for both the protection of the environment and the reclamation of mine sites. Through this policy we are establishing a clear standard and are providing clarity and certainty for industry and other stakeholders which will lead to sustainable and responsible development in the North.
I would like to acknowledge and thank all those who have contributed to the development of this policy. We must continue to work together to create an industry that is sustainable, profitable and environmentally responsible.
Sincerely,
Honourable Robert D. Nault
Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development
Introduction
For more than a hundred years, mines have been operating in Canada's North, providing important economic benefits, not only for northerners, but to all Canadians. Mining in the North has been good for Canada. A rough estimate of the cumulative value of metal and mineral production for the three territories since 1977 is over $18 billion
However, some mining operations closed without adequately addressing their clean-up and reclamation responsibilities, leaving hundreds of millions of dollars of clean-up costs to the federal government. While this represents a relatively small percentage of the economic benefit, in absolute terms, it still amounts to a substantial burden on the government's accounts.
The public is becoming more concerned about the growing number of insolvencies and abandoned mining properties, which are leaving significant environmental liabilities. This increased consciousness on the issue has led to out ward expressions of concern and questioning of support for mining in the North.
On April 1, 1999, Canada created the new territory of Nunavut and, with it, the expectation that Inuit would become the managers of their own destiny. This includes unprecedented participation in the management of their renewable and non-renewable resources. In essence, the creation of Nunavut has given the Inuit a ""clean slate"" to develop the kind of resource management regime they want to take with them into the new millennium. To this end, there have already been strong signals that the development of a comprehensive resource management program, particularly for mining, is a high priority.
The Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development (DIAND) is concerned with the public's eroding confidence in northern mining. It also recognizes the desire to build a strong resource management base in Nunavut. both complement DIAND's thinking and its ongoing search for opportunities responsibilities are carried out across Canada's three northern territories.
DIAND considers the Mine Site Reclamation Policy for Nunavut an important new step in the development of a comprehensive mineral resource management component of the Department's Sustainable Development Strategy.
The development of the Policy was not the only option available. Government continues to look at various legislative and regulatory initiatives to support the principles set out in this Policy. However, legislative and regulatory changes take a relatively long time to accomplish, and it is important to deal with this issue in the context of current legislation from the perspective of operating mines preparing to close in the next few years and new mines expected to open shortly.
It is critical to have resource management tools in place in Nunavut before new mineral development activities become too far advanced. Industry, investors, environmental interests and communities all share the desire for certainty, consistency and clarity.
The Mine Site Reclamation Policy for Nunavut serves four main objectives:
- Ensure the impact of mining on the environment and human health and safety is minimized.
- Reduce the environmental liability that falls to government to the greatest extent possible.
- Provide industry and the public with a clear signal of the government's expectations.
- Build positive and supportive relationships with the new regulatory authorities coming into operation in the North.
DIAND also recognizes that many of the provisions incorporated within this Policy are governmental ""principles"" that provide general guidance and direction. They work in harmony with the existing regulatory framework and the regulators charged with their application. It is not the intent of this Policy to supplant or diminish these existing regulatory authorities or the organizations that have been created to carry them out.
DIAND has been guided by The Minerals and Metals Policy of the Government of Canada, wherein specific reference is made to the challenges associated with mine site reclamation and the federal government's direct responsibilities in the three territories.
It should also be noted that DIAND is developing another complementary policy that relates to orphaned or abandoned sites, including mines. It is called the Policy on the Management of Contaminated Sites in Canada's North. This proposed policy is part of DIAND's commitment to reduce or eliminate the human health and safety dangers posed by contaminated sites, including abandoned mines.
In addition to legislation governing conventional mining, the mining of uranium and other related hazardous minerals is regulated by specific legislation (e.g., The Nuclear Safety and Control Act).
This Policy is intended to be consistent with the legislative, regulatory and policy instruments currently in effect in Nunavut, including the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement.
The Policy offers guidance for the planning and implementation of mine site reclamation in Nunavut. To a large degree, the principles outlined in this Policy have already been adopted and adhered to by the federal government and industry, within the existing regulatory framework in Nunavut. This Policy codifies, clarifies and provides more certainty. It gives a template for the development and enhancement of operational procedures and processes required to ensure that objectives are met.
Enforcement of regulatory provisions related to mine site reclamation will continue to be undertaken through the existing regulatory regime. The Territorial Lands Act and its regulations, the Northwest Territories Waters Act and the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement will be the primary vehicles used, although other pieces of federal and territorial legislation are also in play (e.g., Fisheries Act, Canadian Environmental Protection Act and Nunavut Waters and Nunavut Surface Rights Tribunal Act).
The environmental assessment processes will continue to identify and consider the environmental, social, cultural and economic effects of a mining project and its reclamation, and ensure that the potentially affected public participates during the monitoring and reporting of mine site reclamation.
The principles and objectives laid out in this Policy will guide DIAND's decision-making powers in matters where DIAND has authority and will shape DIAND's position as an intervener in regulatory processes carried out by resource management boards.
DIAND will continue to be guided by other federal policies concerning regulatory efficiency and environmental protection. Given the number of regulatory authorities emerging in the North, it is critical that this Policy be integrated with the existing regulatory and policy framework.
Application
Given the multi-jurisdictional landscape in Nunavut, application of this Policy depends on the circumstances. It will provide internal guidance to DIAND staff in the drafting of terms and conditions of regulatory instruments, such as surface leases, over which the Department retains jurisdiction and in the preparation of interventions to the resource management boards within the territory. The Policy will also inform the resource management boards of the Minister's expectations in terms of their work and what the Minister will be looking for in the regulatory instruments submitted for the Minister's approval. Finally, it tells industry what is expected in its project designs (as it relates to reclamation planning) and what industry can expect from regulatory decision makers, thereby ""fixing the goal posts"" and removing ad hoc, case-by-case interpretations.
This Policy only applies within the jurisdiction of the federal government and, as such, does not apply to those aspects of reclamation that fall within the jurisdiction of the Government of Nunavut or the Inuit as private owners of the surface of land through the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement. This would clearly include the nonwater-related aspects of surface reclamation on lands that are either owned by the Inuit pursuant to the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement or administered by the Government of Nunavut as Commissioner's land. Mining operations, which are located on a combination of Inuit-owned and Crown lands, will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis, probably, through some form of co-operative arrangement between DIAND and the Inuit land-owning organization.
This Policy applies to new and existing mines, whether operating or not, with clearly identified owners/operators. It does not cover orphaned or abandoned sites, which will fall under the proposed Policy on the Management of Contaminated Sites in Canada's North.
The Policy applies only to developed mines and to those mining-related activities that take place on mine sites. It does not apply to activities undertaken during the prospecting, exploration or advanced exploration stages of the development of a mineral property.
This policy is virtually identical to the Mine Site Reclamation Policy for the Northwest Territories (NWT) and is intended to cover mining properties which might straddle the Northwest Territories-Nunavut border. Yukon mining activities are not managed under the Territorial Lands Act/Canada Mining Regulations, and a modified policy vehicle is being developed which is consistent with Yukon's legislative and regulatory framework. It is intended that it will complement its NWT and Nunavut counterparts, to create a consistent pan-Northern policy framework.
Principles for Mine Site Reclamation
The following principles respecting mine site reclamation should provide proponents, boards and government departments with certainty, clarity and consistency regarding expectations, from project design to operations and post-closure.
1. General
- Mine site reclamation should reflect the collective desire and commitment to operate under the principles of sustainable development, including the ""polluter pays"" principle.
- The required standard of reclamation should be based on the 1994 Whitehorse Mining Initiative definition: ""returning mine sites and affected areas to viable and, wherever practicable, selfsustaining ecosystems that are compatible with a healthy environment and with human activities.""
- Every new mining operation should be able to support the cost of reclamation. Existing mining operations will also be held accountable for their reclamation liabilities.
- Adequate security should be provided to ensure the cost of reclamation, including shutdown, closure and post-closure, is born by the operator of the mine rather than the Crown.
- Best management practices, including progressive reclamation, should be applied to advance environmental protection and reduce environmental risks.
- Communication and consultation among all applicable parties should be comprehensive, complete and timely.
2. Reclamation Planning
- Every mine should, at all times, have a mine closure and reclamation plan, which includes measures to be taken in the event of a temporary closure.
- The direct closure impact of all components of a mine site should be addressed as an integral part of the design criteria during the detailed engineering phase of the project, including tailings handling, disposal of chemicals and hydrocarbons and pit shutdown.
- The selection of key reclamation and closure alternatives should be based on current and comprehensive technical information generated by experts, such as competent, credible consultants.
- Mine closure and reclamation plans should be sufficiently flexible to allow adjustments as the life of the mine progresses, including the flexibility to adapt to new and improved technologies and methodologies, and allowing for progressive reclamation, while ensuring obligations under the plans are met.
3. Post-Closure Responsibilities
- Following mine closure, mining companies or their future owners should continue to be responsible for the site, including the remediation of any additional environmental complications which develop.
4. Financial Security
- The total financial security for final reclamation required at any time during the life of the mine should be equal to the total outstanding reclamation liability for land and water combined (calculated at the beginning of the work year, to be sufficient to cover the highest liability over that time period).
- Estimates of reclamation costs, for the purposes of financial security, should be based on the cost of having the necessary reclamation work done by a third-party contractor if the operator defaults. The estimates should also include contingency factors appropriate to the particular work to be undertaken.
- The recognized methodology for calculating reclamation costs, for the purposes of financial security, should be the RECLAIM or some other appropriate model. Consideration should be given to alternate or innovative forms of security, such as mine reclamation trusts, provided they meet certain criteria that protect the government's interests and objectives.
- Financial security requirements related to reclamation should be clearly set out in water licences, land leases and other regulatory instruments, though there may be circumstances where security requirements may be more appropriately dealt with through an agreement.
- Mining operators should be credited for approved progressive reclamation, and the value of financial security required should be adjusted in a timely fashion.
5. Regulatory Authorities
- There should be, to the extent possible, co-ordination among the various regulatory authorities sharing jurisdiction with respect to the management of lands and water to facilitate the consistent application of this Policy, particularly as it relates to the provision of financial assurance for environmental liability.
- The regulatory regime governing mine site reclamation should provide industry and stakeholders with the certainty and clarity required to accept the risks associated with mine developments.
- Status reports on the progress of mine site reclamation and revisions to plans should be required, pursuant to the relevant regulatory instruments.
Implementation Considerations
The following implementation considerations provide an explanatory framework and add detail to the principles set out above.
Mine Closure and Reclamation Plans
All proposals for a new mine must include a mine closure and reclamation plan. This is critical to the long-term future and environmental legacy of the development site. For greater efficiency, a plan should integrate the requirements associated with leasing surface rights and water licensing.
Required Standard of Reclamation
Site-specific criteria should be developed by regulators for assessing the adequacy of plans and their implementation, based on the 1994 Whitehorse Mining Initiative principle of ""returning mine sites and affected areas to viable and, wherever practicable, self-sustaining ecosystems that are compatible with a healthy environment and with human activities,"" including applicable archiving of reports, records, etc.
Where regulatory boards with jurisdiction for land and water management have developed specific guidelines and standards of environmental rehabilitation, these will be adopted for use in the applicable region.
Elements of Mine Closure and Reclamation Plans
Planning for closure, before development occurs, provides the opportunity to develop a flexible and cost-effective design, which helps ensure mine reclamation takes place and the responsibility for costs is borne by industry. It can be expected that techniques and methodology for mine site reclamation will continue to evolve with changes to our scientific understanding and technology. Therefore, approaches to mine site reclamation need to remain dynamic, and evolving ""best practices"" should be an integral component of reclamation planning.
Best practices for both regulatory and voluntary/nonregulatory efforts include policies, programs, technologies, reclamation research and other measures that have been found to be cost effective and environmentally appropriate. Best practices encompass and build on measures embodied within local, national and international initiatives.
A plan should fully address the following:
- The progressive reclamation of the site during the life of the operation, to the extent feasible, given the mining and processing methods employed.
- The removal or stabilization of any structures and workings remaining at the site after closure to ensure that, over time, they remain physically sound and are no threat to public safety.
- The design of tailings and waste rock disposal areas within accepted engineering standards for slope, stability and erosion control.
- The reclamation of the surface to meet acceptable standards.
- Meeting or exceeding currently accepted standards of water quality for drainage from the site.
- Ensuring the site is left in a condition which will minimize or eliminate long-term care and maintenance requirements.
- A cost estimate of the work required to close and reclaim the mine, for each year of the proposed operating life needs to be part of the plan. (Cost estimates should be based on the work being performed by an independent contractor in case the operator default. Estimates should include contingency factors appropriate to the particular work to be undertaken.)
- A list of contingency measures for temporary closure of the mine, outlining specific actions and their scheduling, to be taken during the temporary closure. (As temporary closure is commonly an uncertain condition, the schedule will be necessarily progressive as each week, month, season or year passes.)
- A plan for post-closure monitoring of the site including a monitoring schedule and reporting frequencies. (For a monitoring program to be meaningful, it must include provision for appropriate progressive responses which trigger action whenever exceeded, including the establishment of thresholds or the identification of changes in circumstances.)
The plan should describe detailed measures for the reclamation, closure and decommissioning of the mine including but not necessarily limited to:
- buildings and other structures;
- roads and airstrips;
- tailings disposal facilities and management;
- waste rock disposal management;
- quarries and open pits;
- petroleum and chemical storage areas and facilities;
- pipelines and electrical transmission lines;
- sewage and waste disposal areas and facilities;
- mine and site drainage systems;
- mine workings;
- mine shaft, adit and decline openings;
- site hydrology and water quality including water flows leaving the site;
- revegetation of the site where practicable;
- recycling of materials; and
- site specific requirements.
Progress Reporting on Reclamation
Status reports on the progress of mine site reclamation work should be submitted to the relevant regulatory authority periodically. Since reporting on progressive reclamation is directly related to amendments to the financial security, the timing and content of the reports should match the provisions found in each plan relating to amendments to the financial security (see Financial Security).
Status reports need not be elaborate documents, but should include basic details, such as the reclamation work performed, amount of materials moved, dollars spent and a general account of areas yet to be reclaimed.
Mine Closure and Reclamation Plan Revisions (Updates)
When revisions to mining plans require significant changes in reclamation requirements, an amendment to the plan will be required, in addition to the above described progress report. In many cases, these changes will require an environmental screening, and amendments to licences and permits through the regulatory process.
A significant component of any revision will be the evaluation of the degree to which reclamation costs will vary as a result of changes to the mining plan and the implications for the amount of financial assurance already in place.
Financial Security
A key element of the Plan is the relationship between the closure and reclamation obligations, and the financial security provided to ensure the liability for reclamation remains with the mining company. There are a number of issues relating to financial security which must be considered as part of this policy.
1. Forms of Security
Financial security for mine site reclamation for new mines must be readily convertible to cash. Such security must have the following basic criteria:
- Subject to applicable legislation and due process, it must provide the Crown with immediate, unconditional, unencumbered access to the full amount of the security.
- It must retain its full value throughout the life of the mine and if applicable, beyond.
- It must remain beyond the control of the mining company, or its creditors in the event of insolvency.
The Minister may consider new or innovative forms of security, such as reclamation trusts, provided they meet the above criteria.
2. Co-ordination Among Regulatory Agencies
Regulatory authority to require financial assurance for mine site reclamation is not contained in a single statute. On Crown-owned lands in Nunavut, DIAND has jurisdiction with respect to land leases and related security issues. For water licences, the Nunavut Water Board determines the amount of security, while the Minister of DIAND determines the form.
Since financial security has become a multi-jurisdictional issue, co-ordination is an important consideration. To ensure that financial security is most efficiently and effectively applied, DIAND will facilitate discussions between the various regulatory bodies to promote the co-ordination of financial security obligations. This will include:
- developing and updating of recognized standards, models and assumptions for calculating reclamation costs (e.g., RECLAIM model);
- ensuring that, at any given time during the life of the mine, the total financial security for mine site reclamation in place, subject to the timing of any application for credit for progressive reclamation, is equal to the total outstanding reclamation liability of the mine site, and the financial security for closure-related activities, imposed by land and water jurisdictions cumulatively, does not exceed the total reclamation cost estimates for both the land-related and water-related reclamation elements at each mine;
- ensuring that the terms, conditions and notification processes in financial security are compatible for all regulatory instruments; and
- coordinating the regulatory determinations required from each decision maker (e.g., the Minister or the Water Board) to facilitate the integration of all financial security obligations.
3. Progressive Reclamation
Ongoing reclamation throughout the life of the mine is preferable from both the environmental and financial liability perspectives. The financial security of a mining project will be adjusted to reflect progressive reclamation on the following basis:
- When ongoing reclamation work reduces the outstanding environmental liability, it will result in a reduction in the level of financial security required to be maintained.
- Credit for progressive reclamation work should be made in a timely fashion in accordance with authorities set out in the applicable legislation.
- The value of reclamation work will be based on generally accepted modelling (e.g., the RECLAIM model) and calculated as the difference between previous outstanding liabilities and estimates made of the remaining liability following the reclamation work (as opposed to actual costs, if actual costs do not fully reduce outstanding liability).
- The amount of financial security on deposit will normally increase proportionately as mining proceeds. Generally, this implies that as the mine site grows, water usage increases and the cost to restore a site expands. Accordingly, reclamation costs are usually estimated to rise over the life of the mine. However, as reclamation work is performed, the environmental liability is reduced and the financial security required may decrease proportionately.
- If, during a specific period, the value of any progressive reclamation exceeds the value of new reclamation liability created through additional mining operations, DIAND would reduce the amount of security required through the surface lease and would support an application by the mining company to the Water Board to reduce the amount of the water licence security accordingly.
- Progressive reclamation may not reduce the financial assurance required to zero. Sometimes, a residual amount is required to meet other licensing obligations.
Post-Closure Reclamation and Final Decommissioning
Near the end of production when closure is anticipated, the most recent approved plan will be the basis for final decommissioning. As reclamation work is successfully completed and environmental liability is reduced, the amount of financial assurance required will be proportionately reduced and the surplus refunded.
Where applicable, in addition to the physical aspects of closure, pertinent records should be collected, prepared and archived. These could include a survey of any underground workings, drill cores and broader environmental data and reports.
Once the reclamation work required by the plan is deemed completed, the site will be allowed to stabilize. During this time, monitoring will be conducted by the company and verified by DIAND and other agencies as appropriate, with respect to the effectiveness of the mitigative measures, the accuracy of the environmental assessment and any unforeseen environmental impacts. The duration of the required monitoring phase will be reviewed and confirmed at the time of closure and will depend on the risks associated with the potential impacts on the environment.
During this period, the mining company will continue to be responsible for the site, including remediation of any additional environmental complications which develop. If warranted by site conditions, the monitoring period may be extended to ensure remedial measures are met.
Some mines are anticipated to require long-term care and maintenance after closure.
Examples include sites where:
- acid mine drainage requires neutralization by water treatment;
- tailings containment structures require periodic monitoring and maintenance; and
- remediation technologies are not proven.
The Minister may hold back an appropriate amount of financial assurance to cover future requirements for the site. In such cases, the mining company will be responsible for the care and maintenance of the site, but will also maintain a claim to any remaining financial assurance.
When the Minister is satisfied the operator has met the requirements for decommissioning under the relevant legislation and that the objectives of the plan have been fully met, the Minister will provide the mining company with a written acknowledgement to that effect.
Transition Rules for Existing Mines
This Policy covers existing mining operations. However, it is recognized that the status of reclamation planning and the degree of financial assurance in effect varies considerably from mine to mine. Therefore, the application of certain aspects of this Policy will have to take into account the specific situation and issues of individual mines on a case-by-case basis.
For existing operations, the financial security provided to the Minister for reclamation obligations should be increased in increments to 100 percent coverage as soon as possible, but not later than the forecast life of the mine. Only when a mine operator could conclusively demonstrate that it was financially incapable of doing so, and the Minister was satisfied that it was in the public's best interests, would the Minister consider options relating to the form, amount or schedule for the provision of financial security.
All new reclamation liabilities created by future operations would be subject to the same requirement to provide full security as new mines.
Insolvencies
The issue of what happens when the operators of existing mines become insolvent poses a distinct and unique challenge to both the regulatory system and the application of this Policy. When a mine operator seeks court protection from creditors under either the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act or the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, the company does so with the intent to negotiate with its creditors a financial restructuring that will allow the company to emerge from court protection as a viable entity. When this process is successful, the mine operator remains liable for the closure and reclamation of the mine.
However, when this process is not successful, the creditors of the company will frequently have the court appoint a receiver or Interim Receiver under the provisions of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act to sell the assets of the company. The negotiations with prospective purchasers of a mine within insolvency proceedings will frequently involve DIAND as the representative of the Crown, as a creditor of the insolvent operator and as an environmental regulator. While DIAND will be as co-operative as possible in trying to facilitate such a sale, the Crown will not compromise or assume environmental liability to facilitate a sale of a mine for the benefit of creditors.
When a property is abandoned by a receiver, Interim Receiver, or Trustee in bankruptcy, DIAND will take any measures necessary to safeguard human health and safety, and the environment, using the authority of the Minister under the Northwest Territories Waters Act . Under this Act, the costs of such measures will be recovered from the financial security provided by the operator. Should these costs exceed the value of the security provided by the operator, the excess becomes a debt due to the Crown which, under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act, and the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act is secured by a first charge over the property. If the property is subsequently sold, the Crown intends to recover any debts due to the Crown from the proceeds of the sale ofthe property.
When a mine operator is insolvent and a mine is abandoned by a receiver, Interim Receiver or Trustee in bankruptcy, because the unsecured environmental liabilities exceed the economic value of the mine, which means the property cannot be sold in a conventional sale, DIAND would consider entering into a transaction with a purchaser for the mine on the following basis:
- The sale would generate the maximum benefit to the Crown in terms of reducing the net liability remaining with the Crown.
- Any significant consideration related to the transaction would be paid into a trust fund for the remediation of the existing environmental liabilities at the site.
- A purchaser would have its liability for the existing environmental condition of the property limited.
- A portion of the economic value of the production from the mine would go to a fund for the remediation of the existing environmental liabilities at the site.
- The purchaser would remain fully liable for the remediation costs of any environmental impact resulting from its operations at the site.
- Whether or not DIAND entered into such a transaction would depend on the extent of the benefits or potential benefits to the Crown in reducing the environmental impacts and ultimate cost to Canadian taxpayers of environmental remediation at the mine site.
Policy Review
The political and legislative environment in the North is in a period of unprecedented change. If this Policy is to keep pace with the shifting operational environment, and political, legislative and technological developments, it must be a living document, or it will lose its currency and effectiveness.
To this end, the Department will undertake to review this Policy periodically.

Road would begin at Grays Bay and stretch south to the N.W.T.'s diamond mines
A project proposal to build the longest road in Nunavut — a 227-kilometre all-season road from the shores of the Northwest Passage — is moving closer to fruition.
On Friday, the Government of Nunavut signed a memorandum of understanding with the Kitikmeot Inuit Association to partner on the project.
The road would connect a proposed deep water port at Grays Bay — on the Northwest Passage between Bathurst Inlet and Kugluktuk — to the winter road that services the N.W.T.'s diamond mines. It's one of Nunavut's and the N.W.T's richest area in minerals.
""The challenge has always been lack of road infrastructure to get the product out,"" said Tom Hoefer, the executive director of the N.W.T. and Nunavut Chamber of Mines. ""So this is nothing new in the sense of people wanting to get road access in that region.
""What's new is the Grays Bay proposal came along about three years ago and has been working its way forward as more and more people are supportive of seeing deposits developed in the Kitikmeot region.""
The first phase of the project has a $487-million price tag, though the Nunavut government and the Kitikmeot Inuit have applied for federal funding for three-quarters of the cost.
Eventually, the road could be a vital link that connects western Nunavut to Yellowknife, and the rest of Canada.
- MMG requests halt to review for proposed Nunavut mine
- Nunavut Izok project to undergo environmental review
- Kitikmeot hunters react to proposed mines, road
Road project been tried before
MMG, a mining company based in Australia, has proposed a zinc mine in the region at Izok Lake, but the cost to reach the metals is prohibitive.
Back in 2012, the company made its own pitch for a 350-kilometre road in the area, linking its mine to Grays Bay. But the project stalled at the review stage.
The Nunavut Impact Review Board recommended the project undergo further review because of potential ""significant adverse affects on the ecosystem, wildlife habitat or Inuit harvesting activities, [and] adverse socioeconomic effects on northerners.""
The company subsequently told the board to hold off on the review for economic reasons.
The latest Grays Lake proposal has a few differences — namely it won't link directly to MMG's mine — but the company is happy to see others take the lead on the project.
""MMG strongly believes that there are significant long term benefits that these types of collaborations and innovative partnerships can bring to Nunavut and the local communities,"" said Sahba Safavi, the president of MMG Canada.
""If the proposed road and port goes ahead, we will need to go back and check [the viability of our mine]. It will significantly help the economic viability of the project.""
But Safavi said having a road, or even an approval for one, won't kickstart the mine just yet. It's a long process to first get the approval, possibly even longer to build it, and by then global markets can change drastically.
Nunavut government changing its tune
At the time of MMG's original proposal, the Nunavut government submitted comments to the Nunavut Impact Review Board, saying the project ""could have significant effects on the wildlife, wildlife habitat, socioeconomics of Nunavut, and heritage resources,"" and calling for a more extensive review.
Four years later, the GN has changed its tune with its own proposal.
""There's a whole new mandate relative to resource envelopment,"" said Jim Stevens, Nunavut's assistant deputy minister of transportation.
""I think the biggest thing though, is our partnership with KIA. That allows us to go forward with community engagement consultations and wildlife management, with an Inuit organization beside us in our planning and proposing of any management plans."" . Inuit in Nunavut suffer significant infrastructure inequality, report finds
The infrastructure gap puts Inuit in Nunavut at a serious disadvantage, says Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated
Inuit in Nunavut have far less access to a wide range of infrastructure such as housing, health care, transportation and education compared to other Canadians, a new report from Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated (NTI) found.
And that significant inequality makes every aspect of life more expensive while putting Arctic ecosystems at risk, the report says.
It was released on Wednesday during NTI's annual general meeting in Cambridge Bay, Nunavut.
""When you grow up in Nunavut and you've never left the territory, you take for granted what is available — you think that's normal,"" NTI President Aluki Kotierk told CBC News.
""It was important for us to demonstrate the inequalities so that Nunavut Inuit could realize that lack of infrastructure and how it negatively impacts on their lives.""
The 259-page report aims to measure the gap in disparities as a starting point to address the inequalities.
Little has been done to measure the gap, the report says, despite years of talk from politicians.
""The infrastructure gap cannot remain just a talking point, recognized but not remedied,"" the report says.
Inequalities overlap and compound each other
It uses 55 ""indicators"" of the gap across 18 ""infrastructure priority areas"" grouped into three categories: energy and environment; people and communities; and connections.
The priority areas include power, waste water, housing, education, health and food sovereignty. As well, ports and harbours, telecommunications, air and justice were listed.
The report says these areas overlap and compound each other through factors like climate change, state of repair and skill development.
For example, any infrastructure project in Nunavut provides an opportunity for Inuit to receive skill development, Kotierk said.
The Nunavut government has spent millions of dollars quarantining construction workers from outside the territory during the pandemic, she added.
""That magnifies the reliance we have on outside employees coming into our territory, which goes against the potential investment of all those dollars into building the capacity for Inuit so that we're less reliant on outside employees,"" said Kotierk.
That lack of skill development impacts other infrastructure areas like housing, according to the report.
Between 2006 and 2018, the rate of Nunavut homes in need of major repair doubled 41 per cent from 20.2 per cent, the report says.
In the rest of Canada, that rate is nearly six times lower at 7.1 per cent, according to NTI.
Factors like climate change cut across inequalities
Meanwhile, the rate of climate change impacts has long been known to be higher in the Arctic — which the report says is compounded by Nunavut's reliance on diesel fuel.
About 50 million litres of diesel are shipped each year via sealift to Nunavut, which is the only Canadian jurisdiction without a regional power grid, NTI's report says.
Nunavut's reliance on diesel — which is more expensive, polluting and environmentally risky than other energy sources — is due in part to a lack of infrastructure links to the rest of Canada, the report says.
And despite Nunavut's reliance on sealift and having 40 per cent of Canada's shoreline, the territory has zero ports overseen by Transport Canada and only one harbour, says the report.
Other infrastructure statistics from the report comparing Nunavut to the rest of Canada include:
- Maximum residential internet speed is eight times slower and six times more expensive.
- Access to a regular healthcare provider like a doctor is six times lower.
- Per capita spending on health care is 43 times higher than Manitoba's.
- The average length of airport runways in Nunavut is less than half the length of runways in other major Canadian cities.
- There are no heritage centres to protect cultural collections and artifacts.
The report says its purpose is to provide a practical way forward to address these issues.
That includes changing the narrative away from potential southern-designed solutions toward Nunavut and Inuit-specific realities, says the report.
The federal government has made a series of infrastructure commitments to the North, including helping the territory end its reliance on diesel fuel and providing broadband internet access by 2030.
But without evidence-based research like that provided in this report, it's hard to imagine how that can happen, Kotierk said.
""If we don't quantify it, it makes it very difficult to see if we're making progress,"" Kotierk said. . Hunting restrictions imposed after another Nunavut caribou herd dwindles
Emergency order limits Dolphin and Union caribou hunt to 42 animals
The Nunavut government has imposed a total allowable harvest on the Dolphin and Union caribou herd after a survey showed the population had plummeted from 18,000 to 4,000.
It's the first time any hunting restrictions have been imposed on the herd, which migrates between Victoria Island and the Nunavut mainland.
In a news release Sept. 4, the Nunavut government announced that just 42 animals could be taken from the herd. The restrictions will primarily affect people in Cambridge Bay, Kugluktuk and Bathurst Inlet. The Kitikmeot Regional Wildlife Board will decide who gets to take the animals.
Last year, Cambridge Bay hunters took 150 to 200 animals from the herd, Bobby Greenley, head of the hunters and trappers organization in Cambridge Bay, told Nunavut News.
Drikus Gissing, director of Nunavut's wildlife research division, says there are many reasons for the herd's decline.
""We know that these cycles have happened historically, but there are other pressures on these caribou herds at the moment,"" Gissing said. ""There's development, there's larger human populations that harvest from these populations.""
A major factor is climate change. The herd is named for the Dolphin and Union Strait, which makes up part of the stretch of sea ice over which the animals migrate twice a year.
""Dolphin and Union caribou may be especially vulnerable to the effects of a warmer climate if the current trend toward later formation of sea-ice continues and leads to increased risk of drowning deaths as the caribou attempt to cross on the thinner ice,"" reads a 2013 assessment from the N.W.T. Species At Risk Committee. ""Additionally, in the spring, caribou may swim through channels of water in the ice and not be able to get out, leading to drowning.""
Late freeze-up
Jerry Puglik, 61, has seen that happen first hand. He lives in Cambridge Bay and describes himself as an avid hunter.
He remembers about five years ago seeing caribou carcasses frozen into the ice of Dease Strait, just two miles from the southern shore.
Puglik said Dease Strait, which is the part of the Northwest Passage the caribou migrate across, used to be frozen around Thanksgiving. Now, it doesn't freeze until late November or December.
""Right now it's almost the third week of September and our bay here isn't frozen,"" he said. ""Ten years ago, you'd be able to Ski-doo on the ocean here.""
The hunting restrictions didn't come as a shock to Puglik, who has also seen the number of caribou dwindle, with hunters travelling further and further to find them.
""I'm glad they made a wise decision,"" he said. ""Now maybe it'll give the herd time to replenish itself.""
October meeting
Under the Nunavut Agreement, the minister of Environment can impose an interim total allowable harvest when there is a conservation concern, but further restrictions must be imposed with community consultation.
Nunavut wildlife officials are planning to hold an in-person meeting in Cambridge Bay on Oct. 7 to discuss the decision.
They'll also be working on plans for another survey of the herd to take place next month in collaboration with the community.
""Obviously the communities would have liked to see more consultations, but due to unusual circumstances, we couldn't do it earlier,"" said Gissing.
The survey that found the population drop was conducted in 2018. However, the resulting report was lost in a government malware attack, Gissing said. Once it was found, the department decided to get a second opinion before releasing the numbers. Then the pandemic hit, curbing face-to-face meetings.
While it's the first time hunting restrictions have been placed on this herd, it's not the first time hunters in western Nunavut have faced caribou quotas.
In 2015, a near total hunting ban was placed on the Bathurst caribou herd, which migrates annually from the N.W.T. to near Kugluktuk.
In 2017, limits were placed on the Bluenose East caribou herd, which also migrates between Nunavut and the N.W.T.
And in the eastern Arctic, a similar emergency hunting order to the latest one was issued in 2014 after a survey found the Baffin island caribou population had decreased by about 95 per cent. . Agnico Eagle sends home Nunavut workers as Rankin Inlet residents blockade road
Residents blockaded road to Meliadine mine in fight to suspend operations amid COVID-19 fears
Residents of Rankin Inlet, Nunavut, took to the streets Wednesday evening, blockading a road to a nearby gold mine in an attempt to stop operations amid fears of the COVID-19 pandemic.
After a plane landed in the community Wednesday filled with workers set to go to the Meliadine gold mine, residents blocked the road to the mine with vehicles, forcing employees to turn back.
Another protest started Thursday morning at 9:30 a.m. local time.
However, earlier on Thursday, Agnico Eagle announced that it would be sending home its Nunavut-based workforce from both its Meliadine and Meadowbank mines — Meadowbank is located near the community of Baker Lake — for four weeks, effective immediately.
Every time, before sending someone to the town, we run communication with the hamlet.- Dominique Girard, Agnico's vice-president of Nunavut operations
""We value our relationship with the people of Nunavut and are committed to do what is best for the health, safety and well-being of all our employees and the communities"", Sean Boyd, Agnico Eagle's chief executive officer, said in the release.
""This precautionary measure is being implemented in order to eliminate the potential risk of transmission of COVID-19 from a southern worker to a Nunavut worker, with the risk of it moving into the communities.""
According to the release, Nunavut employees on site will be returned home, and those off-site will not return. All will continue to receive their regular pay.
The mining company will also meet with Nunavut-based contractors in order to discuss similar measures with their Nunavummiut workers.
""Things are evolving, and we took the best precautionary measure we could take to protect the employees as well as the community,"" Dominique Girard, Agnico Eagle's vice-president of Nunavut operations, told CBC.
""We had to fast track the decision making process following the blockade yesterday on the road. But everything was aligned in that direction.""
Employees will not come into contact with community
The release also states that senior management from Agnico Eagle will meet Thursday with representatives from Rankin Inlet and Baker Lake, as well as the Kivalliq Inuit Association, government of Nunavut, and other stakeholders, in order to review the company's pandemic plan.
Girard said these meetings have been ongoing since the start of the pandemic, and they continue to share their pandemic planning with the territory's chief public health officer.
The mine screens employees before they board planes to head north, he said, taking temperatures and having them fill out questionnaires. Anyone with risk factors or showing symptoms is not allowed to board.
Girard also noted that southern mine employees do not have contact with the community — after landing in Rankin Inlet, they travel straight from a plane to a bus, and straight to the mine site. In Baker Lake, employees are flown directly to the mine site.
Some employees have come to town from time to time to purchase supplies, a practice that Girard says has currently stopped.
""Since the beginning of the week, we've minimized that,"" he said. ""Every time, before sending someone to the town, we run communication with the hamlet, the mayors, to say here's who's going to town, and why. But for now, there is zero.""
Written by Garrett Hinchey with files from Nick Murray . Environmental study on Nunavut mine undervalues Inuit knowledge, hunters say
Baffinland says it uses Inuit reports on marine mammals impacts, and considers effects on hunting, fishing
Communities close to Mary River Mine say environmental impacts that the mine's operator calls insignificant are exactly the opposite for Inuit.
""Significance is different to Inuit, from what Baffinland's threshold for change may be,"" said Amanda Hanson Main, technical advisor for the Mittimatalik Hunters and Trappers Organization in Pond Inlet, Nunavut.
Hanson Main was speaking at this week's technical hearings for an environmental assessment of an expansion to Baffinland Iron Mines Corporation's mine in Nunavut's Qikiqtaaluk region. The expansion would see the mine's annual output doubled.
For example, she said, Baffinland says only 10 per cent of a population of animals near the mine will see impacts, this proportion isn't low when it comes to people's food security.
""For Inuit, if they normally go hunting for 10 days and collect enough narwhal to fill a freezer for winter, in a year when they have to go for 30 days and don't have the same success, it doesn't matter if the measured effect is 10 per cent of the population, Inuit have experienced a significant effect,"" she said on Tuesday.
We understand communities are feeling changes. We have never predicted that no effects will be felt.- Lou Kamermans, Baffinland
""This is happening now. Inuit are experiencing significant effects, in their knowledge, that this is due to project related activities, the shipping,"" Hanson Main said.
Her comments followed a presentation by Baffinland to the Nunavut Impact Review Board on the incorporation of Inuit knowledge in its environmental assessment of future mine impacts.
Baffinland's expansion proposal is to increase from a current allowed amount of six million tonnes of iron ore shipped each year, to 12 million tonnes. The project includes building a railway from the mine to Milne Port, and allowing more ship transits during the ice-free season.
The review board requires Baffinland to make a judgment about the significance of impacts caused by changes at the mine.
Now, not later, hunters say
Hunters on the teleconference said they don't see current impacts from the mine being considered as a problem.
Those are changes in narwhal behaviour, fewer seal and sea birds, a loss of fishing places and damage to vegetation and ice because of dust, they said. Communities are also concerned about invasive species that could come from more ships, and about a lack of evidence on how caribou will adapt to crossing a railway.
""Hunters have stated that both narwhal and seal caught this season are skinny, with not much body fat. Therefore, when killed, they can sink immediately,"" the North Baffin group of community leaders near the mine wrote to the review board on Sept. 9, in a letter on its outstanding concerns.
But the mine's environmental impact statement says there will be no significant impacts to marine mammals from an expansion, the letter states. The North Baffin group said that's ""contrary"" to the Inuit knowledge in Pond Inlet.
Paul Okalik, Arctic specialist with the World Wildlife Fund and a former Nunavut premier, said switching back and forth between science and Inuit knowledge just ""to say you are using it"" means that knowledge ""will not have strength.""
""We were told that we were not to disturb our caribou. And we always listen to this knowledge,"" he said.
Baffinland says it uses Inuit knowledge
The Mittimatalik hunters group in Pond Inlet asked Baffinland to update its environmental assessment filed with the review board to reflect impacts Inuit are already seeing at the mine.
The company says it relies on Inuit knowledge to assess any impacts an expansion has had or would have.
""We can't commit to revise the assessment. We stand by our assessment,"" said Lou Kamermans, senior director of sustainable development for Baffinland.
Baffinland says its assessments consider community concerns about the loss of hunting and fishing areas, cabins and camps, the impacts that rotational work would have on family life, and any decrease in food security if harvesting becomes harder or animals are fewer.
Hunters have stated that both narwhal and seal caught this season are skinny, with not much body fat.- North Baffin leaders letter
The company also used Inuit reports on how marine mammals reacted to shipping at the previous Nanisivik mine near Arctic Bay, it said.
These are examples of using Inuit knowledge, said Kamermans.
""We understand communities are feeling changes. We have never predicted that no effects will be felt,"" said Kamermans. ""You can see a change without it necessarily being significant. Significance is a threshold.""
The mine has a hunting program through the existing Inuit Impact and Benefit Agreement to help ""overcome what is being felt by the community,"" he said.
An indoor crushing site is also being built at the port site to help reduce the impacts dust would have on drinking water and fish. But there are some parts of the project that are not negotiable, like the railway, because there is no project without them, Kamermans said.
He said hunters will be brought to the new rail line to identify places where more caribou and snowmobile crossings can be built.
""Our preference is to avoid an impact,"" said Kamermans, but he also said there are methods of compensation built into the agreements Inuit have with the company if any negative impacts happen.
The technical hearings wrap on Friday. . ",True,True,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False

Geography and Geology
Generally, the petroleum source rocks, the shales, are preserved in four of the geological provinces among the nine recognized in Nunavut (Figure 1). They are Hudson Bay Platform, Arctic Platform, Innuitian Orogen (Sverdrup Basin) and Baffin Shelf, in which the Paleozoic, Mesozoic and Cenozoic shales are exposed by numerous outcrops and penetrated by limited drillings.
Paleozoic rocks cover approximately one third of Nunavut. Strata lying to the west and northwest of Fury and Hecla Strait are part of the Arctic Platform that continues northward onto Ellesmere Island, whereas those to the southeast underlie the Foxe Basin and represent the northern continuation of the Hudson Bay Platform. In general, the Upper Ordovician and Upper Devonian strata yield oil shales in the Hudson Bay Platform; the Upper Ordovician, Silurian and Lower Devonian shales, and shales of the clastic wedge are the common petroleum source rocks in the sedimentary sequence of Arctic Platform.
In Sverdrup Basin, the shales are preserved in the Upper Paleozoic, Mesozoic and Lower Cenozoic sedimentary sequence, which include Carboniferous and Permian bituminous shales, Triassic marine oil prone shale, Mesozoic non-marine gas prone shale, Upper Cretaceous and Paleocene marine shales (natural gas with some oil).
Along the Baffin Shelf, the Cretaceous and Paleocene shales are considered as petroleum source rocks.
Exploration and Production
Sverdrup Basin
Most exploration activities in Nunavut took place in the Sverdrup Basin during the 1970s and 1980s; 140 out of the 180 wells in Nunavut were drilled in this basin and the adjacent Arctic Platform. In this area every second well flowed and tested was positive for petroleum, and one out of five found oil. A significant petroleum discovery was made on or near every major island in the western Sverdrup Basin (Figure 2). Industry made 20 significant oil and natural gas discoveries and one commercial oil discovery in the Sverdrup Basin. On eastern Melville Island 2 billion barrels of oil equivalent in the form of dry gas was discovered; six kilometres from the west shore of Lougheed Island, thought to be a billion-barrel oil field was discovered; between 1985 and 1996, 3 million barrels of oil were produced at Bent Horn field on Cameron Island. Bent Horn supplied the light oil that was crudely burned in the generators at Resolute Bay, as well as at the Polaris Zinc Mine.The Sverdrup basin potentially contains another 4.2 billion barrels of conventional oil.
Baffin Shelf
Along the Baffin Shelf, five wells were drilled in the Davis Strait and discovered a giant natural gas field, Hekja, 76 km east of Frobisher Bay. Hekja remains the only discovery along Baffin Shelf, and the best estimation of Hekja’s discovered resources is 4 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and condensates. Hekja is located in the Saglek Basin, along a passive continental shelf margin, and the reservoir discovery lies within a structural trap. Another area of interest along the Bafin Shelf is the natural oil seeps occurrences in Scott inlet. The hydrocarbons leak profusely in the water, and giant oil slicks have been measured to be up to 250 km2 in surface area (Oakley et al., 2012). These seeps are the testimony of an active petroleum system in the region, and have been identified as a potential exploitable hydrocarbon discovery.
Hudson Bay Platform
The Hudson Bay Basin is one of the largest Paleozoic basins in Canada (Sandford, 1987). Only nine wells were drilled with a few seismic lines in the central portion of Hudson Bay. No important discovery was made, and exploration efforts by industry were abandoned in 1980 due to poor results from the wells. Estimating the petroleum potential of the Hudson Bay Platform Basin is currently part of the Geological Survey of Canada’s ongoing research.
Arctic Platform
An area adjacent to the Sverdrup Basin, called the Parry Islands Fold Belt Basin, in the Cameron Island area, shows oil potential estimated to be between 2 and 10 Billion barrels of oil, and between 14 and 51 TCF of natural gas. The Lancaster Sound Basin in the Arctic Platform also has high petroleum potential, but was never drilled. The petroleum system in the basin is of Cretaceous or younger in age. Latest studies of the Lancaster Sound (Brent et al., 2013) suggest a mean value for the petroleum potential of 4.5 billion barrels of oil, and 13.0 TCF of natural gas and condensates.
Regulation
The Government of Canada is the primary regulator of all petroleum exploration and production in Nunavut. The National Energy Board and Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada are the two federal bodies that administer petroleum activities through the following acts:
Petroleum activities in the Nunavut Settlement Area are also subject to the requirements of the Nunavut Land Claim Agreement.
At this time, there are no shale/tight oil- and gas-specific regulations for Nunavut.
Regulation of Exploration
Any surveys and exploration activities require operating licences from the National Energy Board. Consultation and environmental assessments are key steps for authorization processes for any activities. At this time, there are no shale-specific policies with regard to exploration.
Regulation of Production
Similar to exploration activities, production activities require authorization from the National Energy Board. At the same time, tenure of any licenses is managed by Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada. At this time, there are no shale-specific policies with regard to production.
Public Research
Significant research on petroleum resources including shale has recently been conducted through the Geo-mapping for Energy and Minerals (GEM) program led by the Geological Survey of Canada and Canada-Nunavut Geoscience Office.

- Date modified: . Diavik Diamond Mine – Northwest Territories
PDF version (1.7 MB)
Partnership Agreements
The Lands and Minerals Sector of Natural Resources Canada promotes the participation of Aboriginal communities in minerals and metals activities across Canada by sharing information on Aboriginal industry leading practices.
The Project
The Diavik Diamond Mine (Diavik) is an unincorporated joint venture between Diavik Diamond Mines (2012) Inc. (a Rio Tinto company) and Dominion Diamond Diavik Limited Partnership, both headquartered in Yellowknife, Northwest Territories. The mine is 300 kilometres (km) northeast of Yellowknife and consists of three kimberlite pipes. The mine is on a 20-km2 island under the waters of Lac de Gras. Construction of the mine started in 2000, and commercial production of the mine’s rough diamonds commenced in January 2003. Mining operations are expected to continue beyond 2020.
Signed Agreements
In 1999, Diavik entered into a Socio-Economic Monitoring Agreement with the Government of the Northwest Territories to formalize its commitments to provide training, employment, scholarship programs and business opportunities to local Aboriginal peoples. This agreement was ratified through individual Participation Agreements negotiated with each of the five signatory Aboriginal groups, including the Tlicho Government (formerly Dogrib Treaty 11 Council), Yellowknives Dene First Nation, the North Slave Metis Alliance, the Kitikmeot Inuit Association, and the Lutsel K’e Dene First Nation.
Employment and Training
At the end of 2013, Diavik employed 997 people of whom 485 lived in the Northwest Territories or West Kitikmeot region of Nunavut. Of the 485 northerners, 171 are northern Aboriginal. To increase its Aboriginal work force, Diavik adopted an Aboriginal Employment Strategy in 2004 that focuses on pre-employment initiatives, recruiting, employee retention, and employee development initiatives.
This strategy has enabled Diavik to operate a Workplace Learning Centre at the mine site and to coordinate the development of training and apprenticeship programs. Since 2003 a total of 35 apprentices have successfully completed their apprenticeships at Diavik and achieved journeyperson certifications from the Government of the Northwest Territories. In 2010, Diavik committed to add 86 new apprenticeships through to 2020 and currently the program supports 27 apprentices of which 14 are Aboriginal.
Diavik has supported the Mining Industry Human Resources (MiHR) council’s national standardized certification program since it was launched in 2011 by serving as a pilot site. Since then, 96 employees have achieved certification as underground miners, mineral processors and workplace trainers. The training department at the mine site is working with the underground miners to assist and support them in completing the accreditation requirements. Furthermore, the company developed the Aboriginal Leadership Development Program which is based on the company’s leadership competencies and matches participants with a manager who acts as a mentor. The program is built around the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology’s Applied Management Certificate program and has transitioned to the Aurora College in Yellowknife.
Economic and Business Development
Diavik recognized its significant role in creating new and long-term business opportunities that can lead to increased capacity for the local business community. As a result, Diavik has entered into several long-term-operations labour contracts with Aboriginal and northern businesses that supply over one third of its work force. Diavik works closely with Aboriginal-owned companies to assist them in building capacity so they are better positioned to pursue potential future business opportunities. Capital and business spending on construction and operations expenditures reached $6 billion from January 2000 to June 2013. Of this, $4.3 billion was spent through northern companies and of the $4.3 billion, $2.3 billion was with Aboriginal businesses.
Diavik, as a four-time Canada’s Top Employer, was recognized in 2011 as a leader in Aboriginal relations and was re-certified with the prestigious Gold level of achievement under the Canadian Council for Aboriginal Business’s Progressive Aboriginal Relations program.
Community Investment
Diavik’s investment in community consultation and capacity building is evident from the initial planning stages of the Diavik Diamond Mine.
The company initiated Cultural Awareness, Community Well-Being, and Employee Wellness programs. Diavik worked closely with each of the five parties to the Aboriginal Participation
Agreement when developing these programs to ensure project-related cultural and employee/ community wellness issues would be addressed in a sensitive and meaningful manner. The Cultural Awareness program, for example, was designed by four well-known Northern Aboriginal teachers and includes cultural and drug and alcohol awareness workshops; mine tours for Aboriginal elders, women and students; and comprehensive community relations programs, including financial donations and scholarships.
Each year, Diavik invests $5 million in local communities through sponsorships, scholarships and other community initiatives. Through to 2013 more than 1500 people in the Northwest Territories and Nunavut’s West Kitikmeot region have received more than $2 million in scholarships. In 2012, Diavik, in partnership with the Yellowknife Community Foundation, announced a $25,000 scholarship fund, and in 2013, $35,000 was added to the fund.
Environmental Protection
Diavik has entered into an Environmental Agreement with local Aboriginal groups and the federal and territorial governments. Concluded in March 2000, the agreement formalizes Diavik’s environmental protection commitments, establishes reclamation security requirements, and provides transparency and oversight to local communities. Diavik’s adaptive management and customized prevention programs are designed to protect the local environment. Included in the environmental management system is protection for caribou and other wildlife, as well as water and fish habitat. Diavik has established an Environmental Monitoring Advisory Board that is comprised of First Nation groups that are affected by the mine, governments and Diavik.
Diavik constructs a wind farm
Diavik now operates the world’s largest wind-diesel hybrid power facility and is the global leader in cold climate renewable energy.
With several years of studying renewable energy resources, planning and feasibility studies, Diavik has completed construction of the first large-scale wind farm in the Northwest Territories. Four 2.3-megawatt turbines were constructed in 2012 with a capacity of 9.2 megawatts. The wind farm, which has achieved peak power penetration of 52 percent (one half of the mine’s energy needs), began delivering power to the mine’s grid on September 28, 2012.
Over its first year, the wind farm resulted in a diesel offset of 3.8 million litres. Average power penetration is 7 percent with the target being 10 percent. The challenges of the first winter included frost build-up on the blades, lubrication and electronics operations in extreme cold. These challenges were resolved and the wind farm is gaining ground on the 10 percent target. This facility is operational to -40ºC. Before the wind farm was commissioned, Diavik relied on diesel fuel for all its energy needs. Greenhouse gas emissions will be reduced by approximately 12 000 tonnes, or 6 percent of emissions. By diversifying the energy mix at the mine, Diavik is offsetting some of the risks associated with reliance on diesel, which is transported only on the annual, seasonal winter road.
Moving Forward
Diavik’s vision is to be Canada’s premier diamond producer, creating a legacy of responsible safety, environmental and employee development practices, and enduring community benefits.
In September 2012, with the conclusion of open-pit mining, Diavik safely and successfully completed its transition to an all underground mine. With its investment in its underground mine, Diavik ensures local training, employment and business benefits will continue to 2020 and potentially beyond. The transition began in 2007 when underground mine construction funding was announced by owners Rio Tinto and Dominion Diamond Corporation.
Total investment to construct the underground mine was approximately $800 million. The underground mine construction required several kilometres of tunnels, rescue bays, ventilation and dewatering systems, and maintenance areas. Related surface works included construction of a backfill plant as well as infrastructure to double the power generation and water treatment capacity. In 2013, Diavik’s first full year of production as an all-underground mine, nearly 2 million tonnes of ore were mined, which produced 7.2 million carats of rough diamonds.

Partnerships for Sustainable Development
The Minerals and Metals Policy of the Government of Canada fulfills important commitments the government made in Creating Opportunity, Mining Agenda and A Guide to Green Government. The Policy affirms provincial jurisdiction over mining, delineates a role for the federal government in minerals and metals that is tied to other federal responsibilities, and commits the government to pursuing partnerships with stakeholders in addressing issues within its jurisdiction.
The Policy was developed after an extensive consultation process involving representatives from federal departments and agencies, provincial and territorial mines ministries, industry, environmental groups, labour, and Aboriginal communities. As part of this process, Natural Resources Canada published an issues paper entitled “Sustainable Development and Minerals and Metals” in 1995.

Foreword - The Minerals and Metals Policy of the Government of Canada
A decade after the federal government last unveiled a minerals and metals policy, and as we approach the end of the 20th century, Canada remains among the foremost producers of minerals and metals in the world, and the leading exporter. The industry continues to play an essential role in Canada’s economy. It provides jobs for more than 340,000 Canadians, and is the economic foundation for some 150 communities in Canada’s rural and northern regions. These contributions cannot be over-emphasized, for they are an important part of the economic and social fabric of Canadian society.
Yet, as we look ahead to the future of Canada’s minerals and metals industry, dramatic change is occurring. This change is brought on by several challenges:
- concerns about the state of our natural environment;
- rapidly growing competitive forces brought on by globalization and the emergence of new mineral-producing countries in the developing world;
- a need for a more efficient and effective federation; and
- the need to achieve sustainable development.
The new Lands and Minerals addresses these challenges and responds to important government commitments. For example, in Creating Opportunity, the Government acknowledged that sustainable development must be integrated into the way the Government defines its business and makes its decisions. It also made jobs and growth the centrepiece of its agenda for the 1990s, and committed itself to the renewal of Canada’s rural regions. In A Guide to Green Government, the Government elaborated upon its commitment to a sustainable development approach. All ministers undertook to ensure that the concept is given due consideration in their respective mandates.
In the Mining Agenda, the Government made a commitment to update the 1987 Mineral and Metal Policy and to formulate a strategy for the sustainable development of the Canadian minerals and metals sector. In September 1994, the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development and I, along with representatives of industry, labour, the Aboriginal and environmental communities, and many provincial and territorial governments, signed the Whitehorse Mining Initiative (WMI) Leadership Council Accord. WMI participants developed a common vision of a socially, economically and environmentally sustainable and prosperous mining industry in Canada.
In fulfilling these commitments, the Policy represents the first attempt by the Government to incorporate the concept of sustainable development into a comprehensive policy document in the natural resources area. It incorporates many of the principles found in the WMI Leadership Council Accord, and supports the Government’s agenda for jobs and growth by presenting a framework that promotes the industry’s prosperity in Canada.
In the 1996 Speech from the Throne, the Government stated its willingness to withdraw from functions, in such areas as mining, that are more appropriately the responsibility of provincial governments, local authorities or the private sector. The Policy gives effect to the Speech from the Throne by:
- affirming provincial jurisdiction over mining;
- delineating a new role for the federal government in minerals and metals that is tied to core federal responsibilities; and
- committing the Government to pursue partnerships with industry, the provinces and territories, and others in addressing issues within its jurisdiction.
The Policy flows out of an intense consultative process with all stakeholders. It represents an important source of guidance to federal decisions on minerals and metals in the context of sustainable development. For example:
- it sets parameters for federal decisions on minerals and metals, including a recognition of the need for sound science, the importance of global markets, and the benefits of both regulatory and non-regulatory approaches in pursuing environmental protection;
- it commits the Government to continued efforts to secure international mineral investment for Canada and notes the importance of a fiscal and tax environment that recognizes the special challenges of the industry and its global context; and
- it enunciates the Government’s support of the principle of safe use of minerals and metals and engages the Government to advance this principle both domestically and internationally.
Turning the concept of sustainable development into practice will require stakeholders to question their old assumptions, and to examine minerals- and metalsrelated issues in light of the integration of economic, environmental and social objectives. This shift to a multi-disciplinary approach in decision-making will not happen overnight, but I am confident that if we continue to work together, we will be able to achieve our goal of an economically, environmentally and socially sustainable minerals and metals industry.
In times of change, challenges can and should be turned into opportunities. The Government remains committed to a prosperous Canadian minerals and metals industry. The Minerals and Metals Policy provides the Government with the direction and decision-making tools that will help to ensure that the industry flourishes into the 21st century.

Executive Summary
The Minerals and Metals Policy of the Government of Canada: Partnerships for Sustainable Development (the Policy) describes, within areas of federal jurisdiction, the Government’s role, objectives and strategies for the sustainable development of Canada’s mineral and metal resources. These are set out in eight separate parts.
Part I.
Introduction
Introduction
The Policy builds on important commitments and initiatives of the Government including Creating Opportunity, the Government’s Mining Agenda, A Guide to Green Government, the Toxic Substances Management Policy, and the principles and goals of the Whitehorse Mining Initiative (WMI) Leadership Council Accord. It does this by contributing to three key elements of the Government’s agenda: promoting economic growth and job creation, furthering an efficient and effective federation, and meeting the challenge of sustainable development.
Minerals and metals are of vital interest to Canada and are relevant to federal policies and programs because of their substantial contribution to Canada’s social and economic well-being. Two important and inter-related developments have implications for Canada: the globalization of the industry, and the mounting need for governments around the world to collaborate in the development of solutions to environmental concerns and other challenges.
Provincial governments are responsible for mining within their respective jurisdictions. In this context, the Government’s role in minerals and metals has been more sharply focused on core federal responsibilities, including international trade and investment, science and technology, environmental protection, and Aboriginal affairs. The Government is committed to forging enhanced partnerships with others in exercising its responsibilities in minerals and metals.

The Government has adopted the Brundtland Commission’s definition of sustainable development. The Policy applies this definition by identifying the key elements of sustainable development in the context of minerals and metals.
In light of the foregoing, the Policy has six major objectives:
- integrating the concept of sustainable development in federal decision-making affecting the minerals and metals industry;
- ensuring the international competitiveness of Canada’s minerals and metals industry in the context of an open and liberal global trade and investment framework;
- advancing the concept of sustainable development of minerals and metals at the international level through partnerships with other countries, stakeholders, and multilateral institutions and organizations;
- establishing Canada as a global leader in promoting the safe use of minerals and metals, and their related products;
- promoting Aboriginal involvement in minerals and metals-related activities; and
- providing a framework for the development and application of science and technology to enhance the industry’s competitiveness and environmental stewardship.

Federal Decisions in Minerals and Metals: Implementing a Sustainable Development Approach
Federal Decisions in Minerals and Metals: Implementing a Sustainable Development Approach
To achieve sustainable development, environmental, economic and social considerations must be taken into account as early as possible in the decision-making process. To help the Government meet this challenge in the area of minerals and metals, the Policy enunciates a number of principles for sustainable development-based decision-making, including:
- a responsive public policy framework;
- the role of the market mechanism;
- the role of regulation;
- the role of non-regulatory approaches;
- the importance of science;
- endorsement of the concept of pollution prevention;
- affirmation of the precautionary principle; and
- recognition of the polluter pays principle.

The Business Climate: Ensuring the Competitiveness of Canada’s Minerals and Metals Industry
The Business Climate: Ensuring the Competitiveness of Canada’s Minerals and Metals Industry
Canada must compete as never before to attract investment capital to sustain its minerals and metals industry. In this environment, all governments must work together to ensure that a positive investment climate is maintained. As a consequence, the Government makes a series of commitments in the spheres of finance and taxation, regulatory efficiency, and investment and export promotion.
The Government affirms its support for the creation of a Canadian Securities Commission, in partnership with interested provinces, and establishes four principles to guide the development of all federal fiscal measures affecting the minerals and metals industry. The Government also sets out a seven-item checklist for the development of any new federal regulatory processes that affect minerals and metals. As well, the Policy states that the industry must continue to assume greater responsibility for environmental performance and for stewardship of minerals and metals throughout their life cycle.
Part IV.
Minerals, Metals and Society: Promoting Products, Markets and Stewardship
Minerals, Metals and Society: Promoting Products, Markets and Stewardship
The Government supports the responsible use and management of minerals and metals. Given Canada’s role as a world leader in the production of these commodities, managing issues related to health and the environment is a policy priority. The Policy introduces an approach to the responsible use and management of minerals and metals called the Safe Use Principle.
The Safe Use Principle takes a life cycle-based approach to the use and management of minerals and metals, including the application of risk assessment and management strategies, in accordance with well-established stewardship practices. The Principle builds on and complements the Toxic Substances Management Policy (TSMP). In doing so, it sends the message domestically and internationally that minerals and metals and their products can be used safely and responsibly.
Recycled minerals and metals constitute an important source of secondary materials for industry, and generate environmental benefits. As a consequence, the Government will work to: enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of regulations; promote a more efficient metals recycling industry in Canada; advance recycling as a feature of product design; and, at the international and domestic levels, promote common approaches to the definition of waste (including a distinction between metal-bearing recyclables destined for recovery and wastes destined for final disposal).
The federal government has a role to play in the reclamation of mine sites within its areas of responsibility, including establishing fiscal and regulatory conditions respecting reclamation for mine development on federal lands. The Policy recognizes the need to clean up those abandoned and orphaned mine sites within federal jurisdiction that represent an unacceptable risk to the environment or human health and safety. It also acknowledges the need for site owners, where they can be identified, to pay for clean-up costs.
Land access for mineral exploration and development is necessary if the minerals and metals industry is to continue to contribute to Canada’s economic and social well-being. In regard to Canada’s ocean territory, that access will be determined through an integrated oceans governance strategy adopted by the Government. In addition to land access, governments must provide reasonable certainty to the industry that when it finds a mineral deposit, it can develop that deposit.
The Government affirms its commitments respecting the completion of the National Parks network and the establishment of National Marine Conservation Areas. It also remains committed to identifying and protecting terrestrial and marine critical wildlife habitat in Canada, and developing and implementing protected area strategies for federal lands and waters. In meeting these commitments, the Government will follow certain guidelines that recognize the important economic and social role played by the minerals and metals industry in Canada.
Part V.
Aboriginal Communities: Promoting Involvement in Minerals and Metals Activities
Aboriginal Communities: Promoting Involvement in Minerals and Metals Activities
Aboriginal concerns and interests in relation to mineral development are important factors in the Government’s policy approach. The Government also respects existing provincial, territorial and municipal mechanisms for mineral development. Within matters of federal jurisdiction, it promotes cost-effective regimes for the sustainable development of minerals and metals on lands under claim, settlement areas, and Indian reserves.
The Government affirms its support for the timely resolution of land claims to remove uncertainty over the ownership and use of land and resources, as well as to encourage self-reliance by Aboriginal communities and promote their participation in economic opportunities.
The Government acknowledges Aboriginal concerns about the effect of mineral exploration and development on traditional lifestyles and the environment, as well as the desire of Aboriginal peoples to be involved in decision-making. Collaboration between the industry and Aboriginal communities is encouraged. The Government supports partnership approaches involving Aboriginal communities and the industry.
Part VI.
Science and Technology: Progress through Innovation
Science and Technology: Progress through Innovation
Science and technology (S&T) play a critical role in the health and well-being of Canadians, our ability to protect the environment, and our success in creating jobs and fostering economic growth. Federal S&T activities that are based on associated goals (i.e., job creation and economic growth, improved quality of life, and the advancement of knowledge) will continue to support sustainable development objectives. In addition to focusing on these goals in an integrated manner, the Government supports the development of stronger science-policy linkages.
In this light, the Government is committed to pursuing a number of goals related to Canada’s S&T activities in relation to minerals and metals. It also affirms its commitment to promote partnerships among stakeholders in pursuing these goals.
The Government will pursue the following strategic, long-term directions in S&T related to minerals and metals:
- providing a comprehensive geoscience information infrastructure;
- supporting a sustainable minerals and metals industry (through the use of S&T to promote technological innovation both in mining operations and in the safe and efficient use of minerals and metals);
- enhancing the health and safety of Canadians;
- promoting the competitiveness of the Canadian industry; and
- developing value-added mineral and metal products.
Part VII.
Minerals and Metals at the International Level: Providing Leadership in the Implementation of Sustainable Development
Minerals and Metals at the International Level: Providing Leadership in the Implementation of Sustainable Development
Canada plays a leadership role at the international level, deriving from its position as the world’s largest exporter of minerals and metals and a major player in the promotion of sustainable development, including the implementation of the Rio Summit’s Agenda 21. The international nature of many of the pressures on the sector and the lessons learned to date, including the potential of initiatives aimed at environmental, health and social concerns to affect the competitiveness and acceptability of minerals and metals in the marketplace, requires an effective and flexible response by the Government.
The Government reaffirms its commitment to a liberalized, predictable, rules-based international trading and investment regime. It also sets out objectives and conditions for the promotion of the sound management of minerals and metals through a variety of instruments from legally binding agreements to government-sponsored non-regulatory approaches to voluntary industry initiatives. Central to the Government’s approach are the concepts of risk assessment, risk management, and the application of the Safe Use Principle. The Government reaffirms the value of bilateral and regional cooperation, and makes a commitment to continue to provide technical cooperation based on Canada’s solid foundation of minerals- and metals-related knowledge, expertise and world-class technology.

I. Introduction
The Minerals and Metals Policy of the Government of Canada: Partnerships for Sustainable Development sets out, within areas of federal jurisdiction, the Government’s role, objectives and strategies for the sustainable development of Canada’s mineral and metal resources.Footnote 1 The Policy builds on relevant federal policy initiatives, including Creating Opportunity, the Government’s Mining Agenda, A Guide to Green Government, and the Toxic Substances Management Policy. It also builds on Sustainable Development and Minerals and Metals: An Issues Paper, which was released by the Minister of Natural Resources in September 1995. That Paper developed a conceptual foundation for the application of sustainable development to minerals and metals.
The Policy represents an important step by the federal government to advance the principles and goals of the Whitehorse Mining Initiative (WMI). WMI participants – industry, the environmental community, Aboriginal groups, labour, academics, and federal, provincial and territorial governments – developed in their Leadership Council Accord a shared vision of a “socially, economically and environmentally sustainable, and prosperous mining industry, underpinned by political and community consensus.”
In developing this document, the Government has consulted widely with stakeholders, including provincial and territorial governments, as well as others associated with the WMI.
The Policy defines a flexible and supportive role for the Government of Canada towards the minerals and metals industry. It recognizes the responsibilities of the provincial and territorial governments and their need – with industry – to respond to their particular circumstances and challenges. The Policy is not a uniform, national blueprint for mineral development or the implementation of sustainable development. This would be incompatible with Canada’s federal structure, and the realities of both a large and diverse country and a heterogeneous minerals and metals industry.
The Government
is committed to forging
enhanced partnerships…
While the Minister of Natural Resources has principal responsibility for this Policy, it also touches on the responsibilities and mandates of a number of other federal ministers. Furthermore, this Policy is intended to be consistent with approved government policies that advance the Government’s economic, social and environmental agendas, including those related to, for example, protected areas, toxic substances, and fiscal matters.
Purpose
The Policy contributes to three central elements of the federal government’s agenda:
Promoting Economic Growth and Job Creation
…the minerals and metals
industry is a major
contributor to Canada’s
economic well-being.
A cornerstone of the Policy is that the minerals and metals industry is a major contributor to Canada’s economic well-being. It is also vital to the economic and social cohesion of many rural and remote communities. The Policy recognizes that Canada faces increased global competition for investors and capital, and that if this competition is not adequately addressed, the industry’s ability to generate wealth and employment for Canadians will seriously diminish. Consequently, the document addresses those areas within federal jurisdiction that are important to attracting new investment and establishing a positive investment climate internationally.
Furthering an Efficient and Effective Federation
The Policy helps the federal government to meet its commitment to define a renewed and more effective relationship with the provinces and territories in the area of minerals and metals. The document is based on a fundamental recognition by the Government of Canada of provincial ownership and management of mineral resources. Within this context, the Policy delineates a role for the federal government in relation to the Canadian minerals and metals industry that is focused on core federal responsibilities.
Meeting the Challenge of Sustainable Development
The Government is committed to meeting the challenge of sustainable development in its policies and programs. The Policy supports this goal by defining sustainable development in relation to minerals and metals, and outlining a federal approach to decision-making for minerals and metals issues based on this important concept. It also sets out policy and science directions for addressing specific minerals- and metals-related concerns in the context of sustainable development.
The Relevance of Minerals and Metals to Canada
Minerals and metals are, and will continue to be, of vital interest to Canada and, consequently, to federal policy and program agendas in the years ahead. There are two reasons for this:
The Economic Contribution of Minerals and Metals
Canada’s minerals and metals industry:Footnote 2
- is a world leader in the production of many mineral and metal commodities, of which approximately 80 percent are exported;
- is a capital-intensive, high-technology-driven industrial sector that plays an important role in Canada’s “new economy” as a purchaser of advanced technological goods and services, a supplier of new materials, and a significant employer;
- is one of the few industrial sectors that consistently contributes to Canada’s balance of trade – representing over one third of our merchandise trade surplus in 1995;
- accounts for almost 60 percent of the volume of Canada’s rail and intra-coastal freight;
- currently employs more than 340,000 Canadians and sustains or contributes to the economic viability of over 150 communities, mostly in rural and remote areas of Canada; and
- generates substantial additional employment for Canadians, not only in mineral exploration, production and processing, but also in environmental services and in a range of supporting, value-added and down-stream sectors such as transportation, equipment maintenance, specialized equipment manufacturing, semifabrication, fabrication, and construction.
Many of the factors that affect the ability of the minerals and metals industry to continue to make this contribution are within the policy purview of the federal government.
The Globalization of the Minerals and Metals Industry
The second reason why minerals and metals will continue to be important to the federal government has two inter-related dimensions:
- the increasingly global nature of today’s minerals and metals industry; and
- the mounting need for governments around the world to collaborate in the development of solutions to environmental concerns and other challenges.
…Canada must continue to
be an active, effective and
influential partner on the
international stage…
The globalization of the industry and the international scope of many issues, including environmental concerns, has changed the landscape for policy-making in ways that are being addressed by the federal government. New issues frequently, and sometimes unexpectedly, emerge beyond our borders, challenging the Government to respond in an effective and flexible manner. International organizations and institutional mechanisms have become important venues for resolving social, economic and environmental concerns. As a consequence, Canada must continue to be an active, effective and influential partner on the international stage, both at the multilateral and bilateral levels. We will need to forge stronger partnerships with countries that share our views and concerns, and to promote our interests vigorously and persuasively in all international spheres in order to manage effectively our participation in international organizations, processes and relations.
Globalization presents both challenges and opportunities for Canada. Successive trade liberalization efforts by the members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade/World Trade Organization (GATT/WTO) have resulted in markets that are more open to exports of Canadian minerals and metals and their products. The conclusion of the GATT Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations promises to extend these open markets to trade in services and eventually foreign investment.
Concurrent with this trend towards more open trade and a greater reliance on trade rules, there has also been a significant change in attitudes towards foreign investment. Where many governments were once hesitant to accept this investment in their minerals and metals sector, they now actively compete to attract it. As a consequence, Canada must compete aggressively for a share of finite investment capital. All governments in Canada must work together to ensure that a positive investment climate is maintained and that potential foreign investors are made aware of what Canada has to offer as a destination for capital.
…Canada must compete
aggressively for a share of
finite investment capital.
As a world leader in the exploration for, and production and export of, minerals and metals, their products, and related services, Canada also has considerable interest and expertise in questions involving these commodities in relation to human health and the environment. Canadian industry and governments have made substantial progress in avoiding or mitigating the adverse environmental effects of minerals- and metals-related activities and products. However, there remains an ongoing need for policy coordination to promote the efficient use of scientific and other resources.
The growing influence on domestic issues of internationally driven initiatives and trends must also be reflected in domestic policy- and decision-making processes. In a global economy, the federal government must be sensitive to international developments in order to maintain competitiveness and ensure that policy responses at the international level do not have a negative impact on national interests. As a consequence, the Government must take international factors into account in assessing and responding to emerging domestic issues that may affect the minerals and metals industry.
The Role of the Federal Government in Minerals and Metals
Provincial Jurisdiction
Provincial governments are responsible for mining – the exploration for, and the development and extraction of, mineral resources, and the construction, management, reclamation and close-out of mine sites – within their jurisdiction. Comparable, direct federal involvement in the regulation of mining operations is limited and specific in nature. It includes uranium in the context of the nuclear fuel cycle (i.e., from exploration through to its final disposal, including both reactor and mine waste), mineral activities related to federal Crown corporations, and mineral activities on federal lands and in offshore areas.
Provincial governments are
responsible for mining…
In particular, the federal government, through the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, is directly responsible for mining activities North of 60°, including mineral exploration and extraction, the development, management and reclamation of mine sites, and the collection of resource revenues and royalties in the Yukon and Northwest Territories. The Government, however, is committed to reducing its role North of 60° by devolving provincial-type jurisdictional responsibilities to the territorial governments. Devolution of these responsibilities will result in “made in the North” decision-making concerning the development of mineral resources in the Territories.
Core Federal Responsibilities
Since 1994, the federal government has reduced and refocused its role in minerals and metals. For example, it has withdrawn from programs providing direct financial support to the industry and has significantly streamlined the organization and budget of Natural Resources Canada, the focal point of minerals and metals activities at the federal level. This action reflects the Government’s commitment – which was also expressed in the 1996 Speech from the Throne – to operate only in areas of federal jurisdiction, and to do so in a cost-effective manner.
This action reflects the
Government’s commitment…
to operate only in areas of
federal jurisdiction…
While its direct involvement in mining operations is limited, and its minerals- and metals-related activities are reduced and streamlined, the Government recognizes the importance of the industry to Canadians. It also clearly understands that its policies – particularly those of a fiscal nature – and its various regulatory responsibilities in areas such as environmental protection, fisheries management, navigable waters, and taxation, significantly affect the minerals and metals industry. Core federal responsibilities relevant to the industry include:
- international affairs, trade, and investment;
- fiscal and monetary policy;
- science and technology;
- Aboriginal affairs;
- Crown corporations and federal lands;
- environmental protection and conservation (a shared responsibility with the provinces);
- integrated management of ocean-related activities;
- fisheries and fish habitat management;
- navigable waters management;
- health (a shared responsibility with the provinces);
- national coordination of joint federal-provincial responses to policy issues;
- international developmental assistance;
- regulation of all activities related to mineral development in the territories;
- national information and statistics on minerals and metals; and
- nuclear energy, including uranium mining.
Progress through Partnerships
Partnerships with the provinces in their role as owners and managers of mineral resources are an essential and fundamental feature of how the federal government does, and will continue to, conduct business in the minerals and metals area. Partnerships with other stakeholders, particularly the industry and non-governmental organizations, are also important factors in the federal government’s approach to managing minerals and metals issues within its jurisdiction.
Building and strengthening partnerships and using consultative approaches are also important aspects of ensuring Canada’s continued influential role in international organizations and other global fora that touch on minerals and metals issues.
As a priority, therefore, the Government’s responsibilities will be exercised and solutions achieved by strengthening existing collaborative and consultative mechanisms. Where appropriate, new bilateral and multilateral vehicles will be developed in an effort to reflect the diversity of stakeholder interests.
While nurturing these partnership vehicles, the Government remains committed to eliminating any remaining inefficiencies resulting from shared jurisdictions and developing more efficient and effective arrangements for the delivery of services.
Defining Sustainable Development in the Context of Minerals and Metals
“development that meets the
needs of the present without
compromising the ability of
future generations to meet
their own needs.”
The World Commission on Environment and Development (the Brundtland Commission) defined sustainable development as “development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.” This definition has been accepted by the Government of Canada and represents a point of departure for applying the concept to minerals and metals. As a building block of this Policy, sustainable development in the context of minerals and metals is considered as incorporating the following elements:
- finding, extracting, producing, adding value to, using, re-using, recycling and, when necessary, disposing of mineral and metal products in the most efficient, competitive and environmentally responsible manner possible, utilizing best practices;
- respecting the needs and values of all resource users, and considering those needs and values in government decision-making;
- maintaining or enhancing the quality of life and the environment for present and future generations; and
- securing the involvement and participation of stakeholders, individuals and communities in decision-making.
In defining sustainable development in the context of minerals and metals, it should be recognized that the economic and social benefits of mineral development are not all consumed by the present generation. Current investments in human and physical capital benefit future as well as present generations.
The Objectives of the Minerals and Metals Policy
In meeting the desire of Canadians for economic growth and job creation, a more efficient and effective federation, and the implementation of sustainable development, the Government of Canada has established in this document six principal policy objectives:
- to integrate the concept of sustainable development in federal decision-making affecting the minerals and metals industry;
- to ensure the international competitiveness of Canada’s minerals and metals industry in the context of an open and liberal global trade and investment framework;
- to advance the concept of sustainable development of minerals and metals at the international level through partnerships with other countries, stakeholders, and multilateral institutions and organizations;
- to establish Canada as a global leader in promoting the safe use of minerals and metals, and their related products;
- to promote Aboriginal involvement in mineralsand metals-related activities; and
- to provide a framework for the development and application of science and technology to enhance the industry’s competitiveness and environmental stewardship.
Within these broad objectives are specific policy initiatives and approaches that constitute the Government of Canada’s strategy for minerals and metals. Consistent with federal fiscal objectives, all activities are to be undertaken within available financial resources.

II. Federal Decisions in Minerals and Metals: Implementing a Sustainable Development Approach
Sustainable Development as the Integration of Environmental, Economic and Social Objectives in Decision-Making
The exploration, development, production, use, re-use, recycling and disposal of minerals and metals inevitably involve the need to integrate environmental, economic and social considerations in decision-making. The sustainable development challenge is to ensure that each of these three elements is taken into account fully and as early as possible in the decision-making process.
Principles for Sustainable Development-Based Decision-Making
To ensure that environmental, economic and social considerations are integrated effectively in its decisions on minerals and metals issues, the Government will be guided by the following principles:
A Responsive Public Policy Framework
The minerals and metals industry requires a stable and predictable public policy framework that is responsive to the particular conditions that characterize it, including the risks associated with exploration investment, the long lead times and high costs of bringing a project into production, and the cyclical nature of commodity markets.
As well, the framework should recognize that mining operations can put stresses on the environment, and that they must be undertaken in a cost-effective manner that minimizes or mitigates adverse environmental and social impacts. Consequently, government decision makers should incorporate the principles of sustainable development into their respective policy frameworks to ensure that these impacts are addressed in their review and decision-making processes.
The Role of the Market Mechanism
The competitive market mechanism is the most effective means of allocating resources among alternative activities and investments. The Government recognizes that the industry must compete internationally on the basis of production costs. In such an environment, the viability of the minerals and metals industry cannot be maintained through artificial support. Consequently, the Government is of the view that it is primarily the private sector that must assess the risks and marshall the resources for its investment decisions.
The Role of Regulation
Regulatory intervention is sometimes required to ensure that societal objectives are met. Indeed, regulations play a central role in furthering the Government’s efforts to protect the natural environment, and public health and safety. The regulatory framework, however, should:
- recognize, in the context of federal-provincial relations, the benefits of, and the need to strive to achieve, harmonization and the avoidance of duplication;
- be performance-based rather than prescriptive;
- minimize uncertainty, delay and costs to ensure that Canadian resource opportunities can compete in a global marketplace; and
- take full account of underlying market forces.
The Role of Non-Regulatory Approaches
Non-regulatory approaches sometimes offer the most efficient means of meeting a desired policy objective, and are thus important to governments and industry as a complement to regulation. These approaches include environmental performance agreements, memoranda of understanding, codes of practice, guidelines, and other voluntary initiatives. Important features are provisions to ensure inclusiveness in policy development processes, transparency of decisions, accountability for results, and recourse in the event of unacceptable performance.
The Importance of Science
Federal policy decisions – in both the domestic and international context – should be based on the best available information and science. The importance of science to proper risk assessment is also acknowledged.
Endorsement of the Concept of Pollution Prevention
The Government’s Pollution Prevention: A Federal Strategy for Action defines pollution prevention as the use of processes, practices, materials, products or energy that avoid or minimize the creation of pollutants and wastes, and reduce the overall risk to human health and the environment. Pollution prevention encourages the kinds of changes that are likely to lead to lower production costs, increased efficiencies and more effective protection of the environment.
Affirmation of the Precautionary Principle
The precautionary principle is an important factor when the Government needs to make a decision in the face of scientific uncertainties about cause and effect, and when the potential environmental consequences are generally considered to be serious or irreversible. This principle was enunciated clearly as Principle 15 in the 1992 Rio Declaration on Environment and Development (the Rio Declaration) of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED), to which Canada is a signatory:
“Where there are threats of serious or irreversible damage, lack of full scientific certainty shall not be used as a reason for postponing cost-effective measures to prevent environmental degradation.”
The principle complements science-based approaches for the management of risks. Its use is premised on the recognition that our scientific understanding of the potential magnitude and consequences of impacts on human health and the environment of the production and uses of some minerals and metals may be incomplete. While there is a need to work toward closing such gaps in our understanding, there is also a requirement, where potential impacts are “serious or irreversible,” to consider a cost-effective precautionary approach.
Recognition of the Polluter Pays Principle
The polluter pays principle, as expressed in Principle 16 of the Rio Declaration, is also an important factor. It provides that:
“National authorities should endeavour to promote the internalization of environmental costs and the use of economic instruments, taking into account the approach that the polluter should, in principle, bear the cost of pollution, with due regard to the public interest and without distorting international trade and investment.”

III. The Business Climate: Ensuring the Competitiveness of Canada's Minerals and Metals Industry
Attracting Investment: “Canada is Open for Business and Committed to Sustainable Development”
With the globalization of capital markets and the liberalization of investment regimes around the world, Canada must compete, as never before, for mineral investment capital. Given comparable geological potential, mineral capital will be attracted to countries that are politically stable and that have competitive tax rates, efficient infrastructure, a skilled labour force, and efficient and predictable policies and regulations.
In this environment, all governments in Canada must work together to ensure that a positive investment climate is maintained, and that domestic and foreign investors are adequately and accurately informed about the quality of that investment climate. These challenges require two related initiatives by governments: the improvement of the investment climate through policy, regulatory and fiscal reforms, and the effective promotion of the improvements achieved through those reforms. Significant progress has been made by the federal government in both regards. Nevertheless, room for improvement remains.
Efforts by the Government to address the challenge of improving the investment climate are outlined below.
To address the need to inform investors, the Government will continue to promote Canada as a leading source of mineral and metal commodities, minerals- and metals-related semi-fabricated and fabricated products, and minerals- and metals-related technology and services, including technology and consulting services in such fields as mineral exploration, environmental protection and management. It will undertake these activities in close collaboration with the industry and provincial and territorial governments, utilizing the “Team Canada” approach.
Finance and Taxation
Canada has become one of
the world’s principal venture
capital markets for mineral
exploration and
development.
Canada has become one of the world’s principal venture capital markets for mineral exploration and development. Obstacles remain, however, to the ready access by firms to risk capital. Consequently, the Government supports, in partnership with interested provinces, the reduction of the multiple securities-related regulatory requirements for raising investment funds through the development of a Canadian Securities Commission and other appropriate mechanisms. Such action would help make securities regulations and capital markets across Canada more coordinated and efficient, thus facilitating the raising of risk capital, especially for the junior sector.
The Government’s fiscal regime is an important component in promoting investment, maintaining competitiveness and ensuring a positive investment climate. The Government has introduced many important fiscal improvements. These have been based on the principles of fairness, simplicity, economic growth, stability of revenues, and competitiveness.
In developing new fiscal measures, and in recognition of the important role that the minerals and metals industry plays in the Canadian economy, the Government will:
- afford the minerals and metals industry fiscal treatment that recognizes exploration risk, ore reserve risk, and other specific risks unique to the sector;
- provide, to the extent possible, fiscal treatment to the Canadian industry that is competitive with the type of treatment afforded by other governments to mineral developers and producers operating in their jurisdiction;
- seek to ensure that government measures aimed at cost recovery reflect the cost of providing the goods or services received. Such measures should also be developed in consultation with industry and take into account competitiveness concerns; and
- within areas of federal jurisdiction, maximize the benefits for Canadians of their mineral resource endowment by ensuring that royalty rates and mining taxes are set at an equitable level, taking into account the industry’s need to realize a return on its investment that is reflective of the risk taken and opportunity costs involved, and bearing in mind that Canada’s mineral endowment is largely a publicly owned resource.
Regulatory Efficiency
Regulatory instruments are an important means for the federal government to achieve public policy objectives. The efficiency and effectiveness of these regulatory regimes have a substantial impact on Canada’s investment climate and the international competitiveness of Canadian mineral producers.
The efficiency and
effectiveness of…regulatory
regimes have a substantial
impact on Canada’s
investment climate…
The Government recognizes the vital role that regulations play in achieving Canada’s environmental, economic and social objectives. It also clearly understands the need to ensure that they do not impose unnecessary costs and other burdens on minerals and metals activities. Regulatory reform, as an ongoing process, contributes to a more efficient national environmental framework. Consequently, the Government is committed to continuing to streamline environmental regulations affecting mining, while maintaining high standards of environmental protection. In undertaking those reforms, and in establishing any new regulatory processes, the Government will:
- ensure the early involvement of stakeholders in defining a problem and developing regulatory approaches;
- ensure that a broad range of non-regulatory approaches are considered as alternatives or complements to regulation prior to making any decisions to develop new regulations;
- strengthen processes for federal-provincial cooperation and harmonization (e.g., environmental management and freshwater fish habitat protection), notably through multilateral, bilateral, industry-specific or project-specific agreements;
- develop, in consultation with the provinces and territories, national goals and standards, particularly in air and water quality, the application of which may take into account the local and regional variability of natural environments as determined by scientific studies;
- ensure that regulatory processes are clear, coordinated in their delivery, and administered with minimal delay; include time lines, wherever possible; maintain procedural fairness; and achieve their objectives in a cost-effective manner;
- ensure that the design or amendment of regulations is based on a sound, scientific approach and a cost-benefit analysis, and that administration and enforcement are supported by the monitoring of environmental effects to ensure compliance and verify environmental or human health impacts; and
- provide monitoring and reporting on progress in regulatory reform so that the Canadian public can judge progress in achieving sustainable development goals.
…encourage the minerals
and metals industry to
continue to assume greater
responsibility for environmental
performance…and
to be a steward for minerals
and metals throughout
their life cycle…
Consistent with the partnership approach taken in this Policy, and building on its belief that traditional regulatory approaches should be complemented by non-regulatory measures, the Government will also encourage the minerals and metals industry to continue to assume greater responsibility for environmental performance wherever it operates, and to be a steward for minerals and metals throughout their life cycle in a manner that is transparent and, where possible, measurable.
The Government is also committed to improving regulatory efficiency in uranium mining and milling. To facilitate this, it recently amended the Canada Labour Code to allow for the delegation of regulatory responsibilities for labour matters, including conventional occupational health and safety, to the provinces. The Government will work closely with provincial governments, particularly the Government of Saskatchewan, to negotiate the transfer of these regulatory responsibilities to them when reasonable and practical.
Helping Exporters of Minerals and Metals and Related Products and Services
Both commercial and non-commercial factors play a major role in the sourcing decisions of customers. For this reason, the Government recognizes the need to cooperate with industry to facilitate enhanced exports and access to both traditional and new markets, bearing in mind that the marketing of products and services remains a private sector responsibility. In this context, the Government will:
- provide timely, relevant and incisive market intelligence and reporting as a complement to private sector efforts;
- work to raise the profile of Canadian mineral and metal products and services, including environmentally related products and services in traditional and new markets; and
- continue to emphasize the need for greater market transparency for minerals and metals and the value of intergovernmental commodity study groups and other such information-sharing mechanisms.

IV. Minerals, Metals and Society: Promoting Products, Markets and Stewardship
The Policy Significance of Environmental Issues Related to Minerals and Metals
Minerals and metals are naturally occurring substances that are indispensable materials for the development of human societies. While it is recognized that trace amounts of a number of minerals and metals are essential to all life forms, the extraction and processing, as well as the particular uses, of certain minerals and metals can and have resulted in adverse effects on human health and the environment. The federal government is committed to mitigating these effects through an improved scientific understanding of the role and behaviour of these substances, through the implementation of sound risk reduction and management strategies, and through the administration of its jurisdictional responsibilities concerning human health and the environment.
Given Canada’s role as a world leader in the production of minerals and metals, the management of issues related to health and the environment is a policy priority.
Life-Cycle Management
In managing minerals- and metals-related health and environmental issues, the principle of life-cycle management for both process and product life cycles plays an essential role:
- Process life-cycle management applies to specific operations and their associated risks in relation to the production of minerals and metals, such as exploration, extraction, processing, smelting and refining. It includes waste management, decommissioning and site rehabilitation.
- Product life-cycle management applies to specific elements, substances or products and their associated risks based on assessments of all stages in the cycle of manufacturing, use, re-use, recycling and disposal of that particular element, substance or product.
Risk Assessment and Management
Life-cycle management of minerals and metals involves the application of risk-assessment and risk-management approaches:
- Risk assessment estimates the degree and likelihood of adverse effects resulting from exposure to a substance from a process or product.
- Risk management is the process of deciding what to do about an assessed risk, taking into account the results of the assessment as well as legal, economic and social factors.
Health and the Environment
The Safe Use Principle is an extension of life-cycle management, and incorporates risk-assessment and risk-management principles. Borrowed from occupational health and safety terminology and focused on use, the Safe Use Principle integrates the notion of “risk” with “use.” As well, it builds on and complements the Government’s Toxic Substances Management Policy (TSMP). The T S M P provides a framework for making science-based decisions on the effective management of toxic substances that are of concern because they are or may be released to the environment, or because Canadians may be exposed to them through the environment. The Safe Use Principle sends the message domestically and internationally that minerals and metals, and their products, can be used safely and responsibly.
The Safe Use Principle
The Safe Use Principle…recognizes
that…minerals, metals and their
products can be produced, used, re- used,
recycled and returned to the
environment in a manner that is
consistent with sustainable
development;
The TSMP, and by extension the Safe Use Principle, recognizes two points pertinent to minerals and metals and of importance to this Policy:
- naturally occurring substances, such as minerals and metals, cannot be virtually eliminated from the environment; and
- there are instances where certain products containing minerals and metals, or their uses, because of the associated risks, may be candidates for bans, phase-outs or virtual elimination of releases from specific anthropogenic sources.
The Safe Use Principle, in building on the TSMP, recognizes that:
- minerals, metals and their products can be produced, used, re-used, recycled and returned to the environment in a manner that is consistent with sustainable development;
- society enjoys important benefits from the use of these natural resources, in conjunction with their sound management;
- certain mineral- and metal-containing products may pose risks to human health or the environment and, as a consequence, need to be managed throughout their entire life cycle;
- naturally occurring inorganic substances, such as minerals and metals, behave differently than synthetic organic chemicals and, as a consequence, require different risk-management approaches; and
- minerals and metals, in and of themselves, are not candidates for bans, phase-outs or virtual elimination.
The Government supports the Safe Use Principle and will promote its implementation domestically and its adoption internationally as a policy approach for minerals and metals and their related products and uses.
Defining and Implementing the Safe Use Principle
The concept of safe use provides an approach for minerals and metals that follows well-established stewardship practices. In practical terms, the Principle calls for an assessment of the risks at various stages throughout the life cycle associated with the uses of a mineral- or metal-containing product. The results of the assessment are then used to determine the most appropriate management approaches to address these risks. It is generally accepted that, in some cases, the risks associated with certain products or product uses cannot be properly controlled or managed. Consequently, where such a situation exists, the Government will either discontinue or prohibit the specific product or product use.
In implementing the Safe Use Principle, and in the context of the TSMP, the Government will take the following approaches both domestically and internationally. The Government will:
- work with Canada’s minerals and metals industry to develop and implement strategies that promote the Safe Use Principle. Such strategies would include, for example, the adoption of stewardship programs based on the life-cycle approach. The industry can and must play a leadership role in addressing health and environmental issues related to minerals and metals;
- ensure that Canada is a global leader in promoting the Safe Use Principle for environmental and health initiatives of relevance to minerals, metals and their products; and
- promote effective mechanisms to obtain and coordinate input from the provincial and territorial governments and others for the development of appropriate policy responses to scientific or technological advances in the safe management of minerals and metals and related products.
Recycling of Minerals and Metals
With world population growth and rising standards of living, global demand for minerals and metals – as essential raw materials for economic and social development – continues to increase. This growth in demand presents governments with a range of policy issues concerning the sustainable use of minerals and metals and their availability for future generations.
There are a number of factors that will promote the continued availability of mineral and metal resources. While the pace of growth in demand dictates that virgin materials will remain the primary source of mineral and metal commodities, another important source is recycled materials. Because of their value, consistent performance characteristics, durability, chemical properties, and versatility of use, many minerals and metals can be re-used almost without limit. As a consequence, recycled materials are a vital secondary source of supply, and are traded on national and global markets based on long-term contracts or at spot market prices. The fact that recycling generates environmental benefits is an added and important dividend. Recycling extends the efficient use of metals, reduces pressures on landfills and incinerators, and results in major energy savings relative to the level of energy inputs required to produce metals from primary sources.
Given these substantial benefits to Canadians, the Government of Canada, within its jurisdictional responsibilities and resources, will:
- work with the provinces and territories, industry, and other stakeholders to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of regulations and remove unnecessary impediments to recycling;
- promote a more efficient metals recycling industry in Canada through better collection systems and technological advances in separation and recovery processes;
- encourage the development of products that take into account recyclability in their design; and
- promote, in both domestic and international fora, common approaches to the definition of waste that underline the need to differentiate between metal-bearing recyclable materials destined for recovery operations on the one hand, and wastes destined for final disposal on the other.
Recycling extends the efficient use of metals…
The lengthy history of metals recycling demonstrates that domestic and international trade in recyclable metals and metal-bearing materials generally operates on a commercial basis. These valuable metal commodities account for between 30 and 60 percent of the total world consumption of metals and should not be considered as wastes.
The Government recognizes that recyclable metals are captured by the current definition of “wastes” and that this description can inhibit their use. The Government has further recognized that these metals are essential raw material components in metallurgical industries.
The Government remains cognizant of its international obligations and will continue to consult with the provinces and other Canadian stakeholders in deliberations on the appropriate management of recyclable materials. In approaching these discussions, and without prejudice to their outcome, the Government will follow a risk-based approach to the regulatory management of recyclable metals and metal-bearing materials. This direction is fully in keeping with the Government’s commitment to undertake steps to derive a logical definition of “wastes” (the current definition of ”wastes” includes material destined for recycling) to be used in both domestic and international legislation, and to exempt secondary materials containing metals used in recycling from the boundary restrictions imposed by the Basel Convention on the Transboundary Movement of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal.
Consequently, so as not to impede the continued use of these valuable resources, the Government will continue to work with the provinces and its international counterparts to apply appropriate movement and management controls to metals in relation to their risk to human health and the environment. In undertaking discussions on the definition of waste, the Government will recognize existing international legal obligations, including the OECD Council Decisions, the Canada-U.S. Agreement on the Transboundary Movement of Hazardous Waste, and the Basel Convention. While the final outcome of domestic discussions on the management of recyclable metals is uncertain at this time, the Government will be guided by the following precepts in seeking to ensure that it provides for:
- normal commercial controls for recyclable metals and metal-bearing materials that do not exhibit hazard characteristics;
- appropriate regulatory controls for recyclable metals and metal-bearing materials that exhibit hazard characteristics, but do not need to be managed as if they are hazardous wastes, and whose risks to human health and the environment can be soundly managed under conditions of normal use; and
- hazardous waste-like regulatory controls for recyclable metals and metal-bearing materials that exhibit hazard characteristics and that, despite management, continue to pose unreasonable risks to the environment or where there is a history of mismanagement.
Mine Reclamation
Mine reclamation seeks to rehabilitate a mine site to a viable, and wherever practicable, self-sustaining, ecosystem that is compatible with a healthy environment and other human activities. The Government recognizes that the provinces oversee mine reclamation in their role as owners and managers of mineral resources. The federal government, however, has direct responsibilities in this area in the Yukon and Northwest Territories, and in relation to uranium. It also contributes to the resolution of mine reclamation issues at the national level through the administration of the fish habitat provisions of the Fisheries Act, the administration of the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, and through its tax policies and science and technology activities.
…the Government will continue to
play a central role with respect to the
many scientific, technological and economic
challenges associated with mine reclamation.
In this context, the Government has a role in ensuring the reclamation of currently operating and future mine sites. Consequently, it will ensure that:
- post-production mine decommissioning and land reclamation are an integral part of the mine development process;
- financial provisions for the costs incurred in mine closure are accorded a level of priority similar to that given to start-up investment costs; and
- governments and industry work together to ensure that efficient mechanisms are developed to finance responsible closure practices.
As well, the Government will continue to play a central role with respect to the many scientific, technological and economic challenges associated with mine reclamation. Priority areas for federal science and technology (S&T) activities relating to this issue are described in Part VI.
Consistent approaches, including continuous improvement based on the principle of best practices, are essential for efficient and effective mine reclamation. The Government will ensure that, as a condition for mine development on federal lands, comprehensive plans for the reclamation of disturbed areas are developed, including the provision of satisfactory financial assurances to cover the costs of reclamation and, where necessary, long-term maintenance.
In addition to the need to address issues related to present and future mine sites, the Government must also deal with problems associated with past practices that are no longer permitted. Such practices have led to numerous abandoned and orphaned mine sites Footnote 3, some of which pose a risk to the environment, human health, or public safety.
The Government will work with other governments and industry to evaluate and develop alternative financing mechanisms that are acceptable to all stakeholders. In addition, more information on the number and condition of these sites is required. It is recognized that initiatives are under way in some provinces to conduct a survey of abandoned and orphaned mine sites. The Government is aware of the need for action to clean up those abandoned and orphaned mine sites within federal jurisdiction that represent an unacceptable risk to the environment or human health and safety. It also recognizes the need for the owner of the site, where one can be identified, to pay for the clean-up costs.
With respect to the reclamation of uranium mine and mill tailings, the Government has taken a comprehensive approach through amendments to the Uranium and Thorium Mining Regulations and other means, under the aegis of the Atomic Energy Control Board. As a related initiative, the Government has developed a policy framework, including financial and institutional responsibilities, for the disposal of all radioactive wastes. The principles contained in the framework apply equally to all radioactive waste categories.
Land Access and Protected Areas
For the minerals and metals industry to continue to make its important contribution to the Canadian economy, new mineral deposits must be discovered. As well, for Canada to realize the full potential of its mineral endowment, the industry, within specified limits, must have access to the widest possible land base for exploration purposes.
In the oceans territory of Canada, this access, as well as the conduct of minerals and metals activities, will be integrated within an oceans governance strategy adopted by the Government. This strategy is based on the integrated planning and management of ocean-related activities to protect the health and prosperity of ocean systems.
Along with access, governments should provide:
- reasonable certainty that when industry finds a mineral deposit, it may develop that deposit, provided that all statutory and regulatory obligations are met and the required approvals are obtained; and
- clear policies on mineral tenure, revocation and compensation that have been communicated to investors.
Protected Areas Commitments
Although access is crucial to industry and its continued contribution to Canada’s economic well-being, it is also important that certain terrestrial and marine areas be protected from development. These areas make essential contributions to Canada’s environmental health, biological diversity, and ecological processes. In this context, the Government is committed to:
- in cooperation with the provinces and territories, and Aboriginal communities, completing the federal network of National Parks by the year 2000 and accelerating the establishment of National Marine Conservation Areas. The Government will achieve its objectives by setting aside from industrial development (including mineral exploration and development activities) those protected areas required to achieve representation for Canada’s 39 terrestrial and 29 marine natural regions;
- identifying and protecting terrestrial and marine critical wildlife habitat in Canada, including the implementation of federal legislation to protect endangered species and the establishment and management of marine wildlife areas;
- identifying and protecting oceans ecosystems and the resources they contain, including the development and designation of marine protected areas; and
- developing and implementing protected area strategies for federal lands and waters. The Government will continue to develop and implement a comprehensive coordinated approach for the establishment of all categories of protected areas in the Canadian offshore. In addition, the governments of Canada and the Northwest Territories, Aboriginal groups and interested parties will be working together to put a protected areas strategy in place in the Northwest Territories by the end of 1998. The strategy will recognize the existing contribution of federal and territorial protected areas, such as national parks, national wildlife areas, migratory bird sanctuaries, and territorial parks.
Establishing Protected Areas
In establishing and managing protected areas, the Government recognizes the minerals and metals industry’s important contribution to Canada. It also recognizes the desirability of leaving federal lands, particularly those with high mineral potential, open for mineral development when this is consistent with federal legislation and government policies, and compatible with environmental and social objectives. Consequently, the Government will:
…the Government will…fully
take into account the mineral
potential of the area in question before
taking decisions to create protected
areas on federal lands;
- use the best available scientific, traditional and local knowledge pertaining to the natural environment, the geographic and demographic setting, as well as the mineral development potential of the areas, in developing policies and decisions respecting the identification, selection and establishment of protected areas;
- fully take into account the mineral potential of the area in question before taking decisions to create protected areas on federal lands;
- impose land withdrawals that preclude mineral development activities only when specific conditions justify such action, and only after economic and social impacts have been carefully considered. These interim land withdrawals are to be for periods of up to five years, and can be renewed with justification following consultation with affected ministers;
- take decisions only after stakeholders, especially local and Aboriginal communities, industry and non-governmental organizations, have been consulted; and
- enhance its ongoing efforts to collaborate with the provincial and territorial governments, appropriate local and Aboriginal communities, and key stakeholders to facilitate the design, coordination and implementation of federal-provincial networks of protected areas.

V. Aboriginal Communities: Promoting Involvement in Minerals and Metals Activities
The Government acknowledges important Aboriginal concerns and interests that are related to mineral development, particularly:
- a relationship between the political aspirations and rights of Aboriginal peoples and mineral development;
- the significant potential contribution of exploration and mineral development to the economic well-being of Aboriginal peoples;
- the potential adverse impacts of mineral development on the social structures of Aboriginal peoples; and
- the potential contribution that information, including traditional knowledge, can make in relation to the planning and assessment of proposed projects.
The Government of Canada respects existing provincial, territorial and municipal mechanisms for mineral development. Within matters of federal jurisdiction, it promotes cost-effective regimes for the sustainable development of minerals and metals on lands under claim, settlement areas, and Indian reserves.
Federal policies vary depending on whether the mining development takes place on Indian reserves, lands involved in claims negotiations, other federal lands, or off-reserve provincial lands. When development occurs on Indian reserves, the Government, in carrying out its responsibilities under the Indian Act, has as objectives: a fair return to the First Nations from their minerals, protection of the environment, rehabilitation and restoration of the site for future generations, and First Nations involvement in projects, in keeping with their aspirations. Through mechanisms such as the First Nations lands initiative and the federal policy on the inherent right of self-government, the Government encourages First Nations control over reserve lands and resources.
The Government affirms its support for the timely resolution of land claims to remove uncertainty over the ownership and use of land and resources, and to encourage self-reliance by Aboriginal communities and promote their participation in economic opportunities.
The Government affirms
its support for the timely
resolution of land claims…
Off-reserve federal lands are located primarily in the Yukon and Northwest Territories. With respect to development on these lands, the Government recognizes Aboriginal concerns about the effect of mineral exploration and development on traditional lifestyles and the environment. It also recognizes the desire of Aboriginal peoples to be involved in decision-making, and to participate in the economic benefits derived from exploration and development activities. Subject to land claim settlements and territorial jurisdiction, the Government is of the view that these interests should be addressed through timely notification of developments and environmental assessment processes that identify and mitigate environmental concerns.
Where mineral development occurs on land under provincial jurisdiction, the federal government has an interest regarding the effect of these developments on federal lands, including Indian reserves, and on Aboriginal communities located outside federal lands. The federal government provides funding to Aboriginal communities to negotiate economic benefit agreements with developers.
The Government believes that collaboration between the industry and Aboriginal communities related to local mineral development should be encouraged. One mechanism for encouraging such collaboration is the Aboriginal Participation in Mining Sub- Committee of the Intergovernmental Working Group on the Mineral Industry (IGWG).
With respect to large-scale projects, where several government agencies – federal, provincial and/or territorial – and other stakeholders have an interest or responsibility, the Government supports the partnership approach described in this Policy in working with these parties to address major issues. Approaches that are tested and found to be successful in this context will be reviewed for their possible broader application.

VI. Science and Technology: Progress through Innovation
As articulated in Science and Technology for the New Century: A Federal Strategy, the Government of Canada recognizes the critical role played by science and technology (S&T) in three broad areas: the health and well-being of Canadians, our ability to protect the environment, and our success in creating jobs and fostering economic growth.
… Canada’s S&T activities
related to minerals and
metals will continue to
support sustainable
development objectives.
As a consequence, the Government, in acknowledging its responsibility as a major participant in Canada’s “innovation system,” established three related goals for its science and technology activities: job creation and economic growth, improved quality of life, and the advancement of knowledge. The Government recognizes the interdependence of these three goals and the need to pursue them in a mutually reinforcing manner. By focusing on these goals, Canada’s S&T activities related to minerals and metals will continue to support sustainable development objectives.
In addition to focusing on these three goals in an integrated manner, the Government will take the following approach:
- minerals- and metals-related policies will be based on sound science; and
- science activities should be informed by, and responsive to, public policy priorities.
For these reasons, the Government supports stronger links between scientific and policy organizations who work on common topics. Such linkages will better serve the needs of stakeholders, as well as society as a whole.
Federal Science and Technology in Minerals and Metals
In its approach to S&T activities in relation to minerals and metals, the Government will pursue the following goals:
- promote enhanced productivity of the industry through collaborative efforts focused on technological innovation;
- provide a window and access point for Canadian companies – particularly small- and medium sized enterprises – to acquire international minerals- and metals-related S&T;
- evaluate external technological developments to assess their usefulness and value to Canadian operations in the minerals and metals sector and the degree to which they complement and build upon Canada’s own S&T advances;
- promote the transfer of technologies within Canada in order to transform research into exploitable know-how and to promote the sharing of expertise among all participants;
- provide Canadians with the geoscience and geomatics knowledge and infrastructure to support public policy objectives and furnish Canadians with the information, expertise and technologies necessary to exploit domestic and foreign markets;
- facilitate collaborative approaches to problems for which national effort and coordination are necessary;
- share internationally Canada’s scientific and technological experience and expertise in implementing sustainable development in the area of minerals and metals and, in particular, with developing countries and international development assistance agencies;
- promote the development of environmental protection and pollution prevention technologies – equipment and processes – in partnership with other federal stakeholders, industry, and the provinces and territories; and
- work with industry to realize more benefits in terms of employment and revenues from mineral and metal resources through value-added manufacturing of mineral- and metal-based products.
The Importance of Partnerships
Federal S&T organizations working on minerals- and metals-related activities include the Canada Centre for Mineral and Energy Technology (CANMET), Geomatics Canada, and the Geological Survey of The Minerals and Metals Policy … Canada’s S&T activities related to minerals and metals will continue to support sustainable development objectives. 19 Canada (GSC), as well as Agriculture and Agri- Food Canada, the Department of Fisheries and Oceans, Environment Canada, Health Canada, and the National Research Council. In pursuing the above goals, these organizations, individually and cooperatively, will work towards the further development of partnerships with industry, provincial and territorial governments, international organizations, government agencies in other countries, academic research institutions, and other groups actively involved in S&T.
The Government will continue to promote partnerships among stakeholders to ensure that:
- programs are delivered with maximum efficiency;
- synergies across programs are exploited fully;
- governments can develop long-term S&T research strategies and goals; and
- activities – either by the federal government or others – are enhanced.
Mechanisms such as the Memorandum of Understanding between Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, Environment Canada, the Department of Fisheries and Oceans, and Natural Resources Canada (“Science and Technology for Sustainable Development in the Natural Resource Sectors”) and the Intergovernmental Geoscience Accord are considered important to the creation of further opportunities for collaboration and cooperation.
Strategic Directions in Science and Technology
The Government, in consultation with the provinces and territories and other stakeholders, is committed to the following broad strategic and long-term directions in the area of S&T and minerals and metals:
Providing a Comprehensive Geoscience Knowledge Base
Knowledge of the landmass is fundamental to sustainable development, including efforts to ensure resource adequacy and sound environmental stewardship. In particular, geoscience maps, data and concepts provided by governments play an important role in attracting investment and in enhancing the cost-effectiveness of mineral exploration. To this end, the Government will:
Knowledge of the landmass
is fundamental to sustainable
development…
- give stakeholders a greater role in determining the Government’s geoscience priorities through the advisory structure established under the federal-provincial geoscience accords;
- use geoscience mapping programs to achieve a balance between areas of high development potential, where enhanced knowledge will increase the probability of discovery of new reserves, and frontier areas, particularly in the North, where new maps will attract investment and increase exploration efficiency. Collaborative projects with the provincial and territorial geological surveys under the National Geoscience Mapping Program (NATMAP) will be an important mechanism for the delivery of this work;
- promote the development of innovative exploration methods that will help industry discover the deeply buried orebodies needed to sustain production in existing mining districts. The multi-disciplinary approach exemplified by the GSC’s Exploration Science and Technology (EXTECH) Program will be a key element of this initiative;
- improve the understanding of the relative contributions from natural and anthropogenic sources to metal loadings in the environment and the significance of the long-range atmospheric transport of metals in the atmosphere, and establish the natural background concentrations of metals as a basis for environmental impact assessments; and
- further enhance the timely dissemination of geoscientific maps and data through the application of state-of-the-art information technologies.
Supporting a Sustainable Minerals and Metals Industry
An effective response to many of the sustainable development challenges facing the minerals and metals industry largely depends on the development and use of S&T to promote technological innovation and to improve the knowledge base for decision makers. In recognition of this, the Government will give the following areas priority attention in federal S&T activities in minerals and metals:
- Sustainable Mining Operations
Work will address acidic drainage and effluents, aquatic effects monitoring, and mine decommissioning and rehabilitation, including:negotiating with the provinces and territories for the development of a national repository of physical, chemical and biological data on mine sites, building on the federal government’s current cooperative activities with Ontario and Nova Scotia;conducting research into improved high-strength, high-density fill systems;continuing laboratory and field studies on underwater and other methods for the disposal of reactive wastes, and research into the restoration of affected land and waters to environmentally acceptable standards; andtransferring to the private sector, through the Mine Environment Neutral Drainage (MEND) program, technology that enhances our ability to predict, prevent, control and treat acidic drainage.
- Safe and Efficient Processing and Use of Minerals and Metals
Attention will focus on:developing more efficient and environmentally friendly production and conversion processes;extending the effective life of metal products;reducing energy consumption entailed in product use, as well as employing other strategies to reduce adverse environmental impacts that may arise in the use of mineral and metal-based products;maximizing the acceptance of recycled materials in the production of metal parts and developing technologies to facilitate recycling; andproviding a sound scientific base and technology for the development of policies and regulations in relation to metals and the environment.
Enhancing the Health and Safety of Canadians
The Government recognizes that S&T related to minerals and metals can play a vital role in enhancing the health and safety of workers and other Canadians. In support of this objective, the Government will give the following areas priority attention:
- the underground mine environment;
- ground stability and control;
- testing of equipment for underground use;
- technical support for the development of standards and regulations addressing worker safety and health in mining operations; and
- extension of the service reliability of Canadian infrastructure (i.e., oil and gas pipelines, transportation, and offshore structures).
Consistent with its theme of partnerships, the Government supports the continued development of its linkages with the industry, the provinces and territories, and others. This will include exploring, with provincial and territorial mine inspectorates, possible increased collaboration in S&T.
Promoting the Competitiveness of the Canadian Industry
S&T are essential tools
in support of the
competitiveness of the
Canadian minerals and
metals industry.
S&T are essential tools in support of the competitiveness of the Canadian minerals and metals industry. S&T can assist in spurring innovation that leads to reduced costs, increased productivity, and achievement of environmental standards. The Government will focus on the following areas in seeking to utilize S&T to improve the competitive position of the Canadian minerals and metals industry:
- understanding the genesis of mineral deposits;
- exploration technology;
- mine mechanization and automation;
- metallurgical processing;
- increased energy and materials efficiencies in manufacturing; and
- the re-use and recycling of mineral and metal products.
The Government recognizes the importance of ensuring that its S&T activities assist Canadian enterprises in their development of export opportunities. As a consequence, the Government will:
- support efforts to develop international technical standards for product specifications to facilitate trade in mineral commodities; and
- promote international sales of Canadian expertise and technologies in areas such as mineral exploration and development, environmental monitoring, pollution prevention and control, and site rehabilitation.
Developing Value-Added Mineral and Metal Products
The production of value-added mineral and metal products is an important source of jobs for Canadians, especially as the primary production of mineral and metal commodities becomes increasingly globalized. Through its science and technology programs, the Government provides assistance to this sector in its efforts to achieve sustainable development goals, for example, in the areas of environmental quality, safety, and the efficient use of energy and materials.
The Government will continue to provide assistance to the value-added sector, including the following activities:
- implementing the Technology Partnerships Canada program, a collaborative initiative by the Government with Canadian business to enhance technological innovation, competitiveness, and productivity;
- identifying Natural Resources Canada as a hub for cooperative metals and materials research in Canada through active negotiation of collaborative research agreements with organizations that have common interests and complementary programs; and
- developing, in partnership with industry, technologies to improve the manufacturing processes for, and the performance of, mineral and metal-based products.

VII. Minerals and Metals at the International Level: Providing Leadership in the Implementation of Sustainable Development
Minerals and metals are vital to modern industrial activity, global development and quality of life. Whether from naturally occurring or anthropogenic sources, they have an impact on the daily lives of every inhabitant of our planet. Although mining activity is domestic, markets are global, as is the competition for investment capital. The environmental impact of minerals and metals extraction, processing, use, re-use, production, transportation, recycling, or disposal does not always respect borders. Associated social issues have had an increasingly international dimension. The international nature of many of the pressures on the sector will necessarily influence the type of partnerships, programs and activities that need to be developed in response. Canada’s global role in the sustainable development of minerals and metals is elaborated below. In playing that role, Canada has developed an approach that is assertive, action-oriented, and cognizant of multi-stakeholder interests. It is a role the international community expects of us.
Trade Liberalization and Investment
Canada is the world’s largest exporter of minerals and metals, exporting approximately 60 different mineral commodities to over 100 countries around the globe. Canada is also a major exporter of downstream, value-added mineral- and metal-related products, as well as environmentally sound technologies. As a major trading nation, and as the home of several large, integrated multinational minerals and metals producers, as well as a growing number of junior mining companies involved in direct investment, and exploration and development activities abroad, Canada is dependent on transparent, predictable, rules-based international trade and investment regimes. The World Trade Organization (WTO) is an essential forum for their pursuit. Also important is the work being done under the auspices of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) – in particular, current efforts to develop a multilateral international investment framework. Free trade areas, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and bilateral agreements can advance global free trade by promoting the flow of goods, services and investment through the progressive lowering of tariffs and elimination of non-tariff barriers.
Canada is the world's largest
exporter of minerals and metals
The Government will promote:
the progressive reduction in tariffs on mineral and metal commodities and products;
- the elimination of unjustifiable non-tariff barriers that impede the industry’s access to international markets;
- the use of existing trade remedy and dispute settlement mechanisms to redress unjustified health and environmental standards that restrict trade;
- the expansion of free trade areas such as the one established under NAFTA;
- a multilateral framework of rules that will protect and promote international investment; and
- appropriate bilateral double taxation and foreign investment protection agreements.
Sound Management of Minerals and Metals
As for other sectors, the international community is grappling with the translation of sustainable development of minerals and metals into practice. Environmental, health and labour standard initiatives have the potential to affect the competitiveness and acceptability of mineral and metal products in the marketplace. Canada is expected to play a defining role in international fora engaged in the development of instruments aimed at viable long-term solutions to problems of sustainable development. Central to Canadian approaches are the concepts of risk assessment, risk management, and the Safe Use Principle.
A number of international institutions are involved. The Intergovernmental Forum for Chemical Safety (IFCS) was established to identify priorities for cooperative action in pursuit of Chapter 19 of the Rio Summit’s Agenda 21, which addresses the Environmentally Sound Management of Toxic Chemicals. The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and other United Nations bodies, including the Commission on Sustainable Development (CSD), the Economic Commission for Europe (ECE), the International Maritime Organization (IMO), and the Interorganization for the Sound Management of Chemicals (IOMC), are active on a variety of initiatives, including a Prior Informed Consent Convention and a Heavy Metals Protocol to the ECE Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution.
The OECD is playing a lead role on a number of fronts, including the development of an approach to the management of trade in hazardous waste destined for recycling. Its risk reduction program has led to pilot projects for five chemicals and, in particular, the voluntary industry Action Program on lead. Intergovernmental commodity study groups are also playing an increasing role in the development and implementation of such initiatives.
Increased global cooperation has fostered a variety of mechanisms to address environmental, health and safety concerns related to particular minerals and metals. The experience of recent years, however, has yielded important lessons. There is a recognition of the need to be creative in developing approaches that are practical, effective and, where necessary, legally enforceable. The goal is to address environmental, health and safety concerns while ensuring that society continues to derive the benefits from the responsible use of minerals and metals. The potential adverse economic consequences of the various instruments will require close attention. It will also be important to differentiate more clearly between minerals and metals and other chemicals in the development of such instruments.
The Government will seek to ensure that international approaches allow for the safe production, transportation, use, re-use, recycling or disposal of mineral and metal products and raw materials, as well as the appropriate regulatory measures for managing products and materials that exhibit risk factors of concern.
The Government will promote consideration of an integrated mechanism for the sound management of chemicals, providing for the full range of appropriate instruments from legally binding agreements to government-sponsored non-regulatory approaches to voluntary industry initiatives.
Canada is expected to play
a defining role in international fora
The Government will continue to support the development of multilateral environmental agreements (MEAs) that are environmentally effective, science-based, and take into account economic and social considerations.
Trade measures have been used to enforce MEAs and to prevent non-parties from circumventing obligations contained in an agreement. They are, however, generally not a first best option and should only be considered when the policy objectives of the agreement would otherwise be thwarted. The relationship between the use of trade measures in MEAs and international trade rules is currently under examination by the WTO.
Where trade provisions are considered necessary, the Government will seek to ensure that:
- all other reasonable approaches to achieving the desired outcome have been properly evaluated and have been deemed to be ineffective;
- the selected approach is consistent with Canada’s international trade obligations and established government policies and programs; and
- the selected measure is the least trade-restrictive available and is not intended to confer a competitive advantage.
Social policy issues are also being addressed, notably in the World Health Organization and the International Labour Organization (ILO). An ILO Convention and Recommendation on Safety and Health in Mines, adopted in 1995, set comprehensive international standards to improve safety and health for the 25 million workers directly involved in mining. The Government will be examining the implementation of these instruments in consultation with the provinces, including the possible future ratification of the Convention. Canadian initiatives such as the Workplace Hazardous Materials Information System (WHMIS), which is designed to ensure that information on hazardous products is consistently and systematically transferred from suppliers to employers to workers on a national basis, have been favourably viewed internationally. Human rights questions, including child labour abroad, will receive increasing attention.
Bilateral and Regional Cooperation
Traditionally, Canada has benefitted from bilateral working groups, such as the Canada-EU Metals and Minerals Working Group, as fora for consultations aimed at market transparency and economic cooperation. Increasingly, these fora have provided opportunities for raising sustainable development concerns. A number of countries in the Americas are major producers of minerals and metals and look to Canada as an example of workable and sustainable development-based policy approaches. Memoranda of Understanding can provide a framework for enhanced cooperation, as can regional initiatives such as the Mines Ministers of the Americas meetings. Similarly, the Government supports the work of such regional bodies as the NAFTA Environment Commission and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Expert Group on Minerals and Energy Exploration and Development (GEMEED).
The Government affirms its commitment, through bilateral and regional initiatives, to promote the sustainable development of minerals and metals and to develop, where resources permit, partnerships with countries that share our views and concerns.
Technical Cooperation
Over the past 130 years, Canada has developed the knowledge, expertise and world-class technology in mining that enables it to play a leadership role. With this foundation, Canada provides policy advice and scientific and technological assistance to developing countries that are trying to respond to the sustainable development challenge in the context of minerals and metals. For example, the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA), through the Canada Centre for Mineral and Energy Technology (CANMET) and the Geological Survey of Canada (GSC), has played a major role to this end. In a multilateral setting, Canada has also played a role through mechanisms such as training and education programs, and technology transfer workshops, hosted, for example, under OECD auspices or conducted as part of the Basel Convention implementation process. As a goal, the Government, within the scope of existing resources, will continue to promote its willingness to share Canada’s experience and expertise in implementing sustainable development in the area of minerals and metals, particularly with developing countries and international development assistance agencies.
Consultations with Stakeholders
Responding to diverse issues and policy pressures requires that governments be well informed about the interests and viewpoints of the many stakeholders likely to be affected. To promote the free exchange of information between the federal government and affected stakeholders, transparency and effective means of communication are essential. Therefore, the Government is committed to managing its participation in multilateral fora to ensure clarity and transparency for clients. Whenever possible, Canadian positions will be developed in consultation with the provinces and territories, and with input from the industry, the environmental community, and other stakeholders.

VIII. Measurement and Follow-Up
Criteria and Indicators
The Government recognizes that criteria and indicators are essential because they help us to measure progress by industry toward the achievement of sustainable development. Accordingly, the Government views the development of sustainability criteria related to environmental, economic and social objectives and indicators for minerals and metals as a priority. It also acknowledges that the formulation of criteria and indicators should be a collaborative undertaking involving all stakeholders, and is prepared to work with the provinces and territories, and other stakeholders, in this area.
Implementation and Accountability
The Government acknowledges that the implementation of the Minerals and Metals Policy will only be successful through ongoing accountability for, and assessment of, results. For this reason, the Minister of Natural Resources will, in cooperation with other federal departments and agencies, issue periodic progress reports on the implementation of this Policy.
In implementing this Policy, the Government will take into account appropriate internationally established standards and Canada’s international commitments to sustainable development and to free trade. By working bilaterally and multilaterally with other countries, and through international fora such as the United Nations and its agencies, the OECD, and the WTO, Canada will promote the Policy’s objectives and strategies, including the sustainable development of minerals and metals, both domestically and internationally.

Northern Canadian communities, like other communities in Canada, face numerous challenges in order to ensure access to safe and plentiful water supplies. There are several factors that make this responsibility different in the North such as reliance on surface water only, presence of permafrost, low precipitation, rising consumption and changes in climate, placing an additional strain on the limited resource of surface freshwater. This research presents an example of bathymetric survey and watershed boundary mapping for the protection and evaluation of freshwater supplies for the city of Iqaluit in Nunavut. The technology transfer aspect of the activity was orientated towards local personnel on how low-cost equipment can be used to provide basic, yet accurate information.
In July 2007, on site field surveys were conducted by scientists from Natural Resources Canada, a Nunavut government technologist and a local college teacher, to apply watershed mapping methods to support the monitoring of Lake Geraldine, the water supply reservoir of the city of Iqaluit, and for community planning.
Several geomatics information datasets resulted from this initiative.
- The outline of the watershed of Lake Geraldine was carefully mapped, using various techniques. The result is illustrated (inset) in Figure 1.
- This initiative also included a detailed bathymetric survey of the lake itself. Bathymetric contour lines (isobaths) were generated at 1 metre intervals and a map at a scale of 1: 2,000 was produced as shown in Figure 1. Derived information is included on the map, such as total lake volume, and water volume at various depth intervals (A limited number of copies are available upon request).
- In addition to the watershed and bathymetric surveys, precise ground control points were acquired to georeference a high resolution (QuickBirdTM) satellite image. This corrected, geocoded image is used as a geographic reference for several development applications and has been distributed to registered partners.
- Several sources of ground control points were used to rectify the image, including high precision GPS and existing Geodetic Survey points characterized as painted crosses on the ground. These points will also be used for the orthorectification of a newly acquired high resolution (WorldView-1TM) stereo image dataset for the production of a detailed digital elevation model of the Iqaluit surroundings.
Within the scope of the project Building Resilience to Climate Change in Human Settlements, this technology transfer activity in geomatics and remote sensing led to the production of a detailed map and statistics related to the surface freshwater resource, and the training of local personnel. All team members recognised how effectively this initiative can be reproduced in other communities of Nunavut. Improved estimates of water reservoir volume and watershed boundaries provides important information which assists with monitoring a changing climate that is beginning to affect the Arctic more significantly.

IQALUIT, NUNAVUT -- A member of Parliament from Nunavut says she won't forget the smell of mould that permeated through houses she visited across the territory last year.
Mumilaaq Qaqqaq travelled to communities in the Kitikmeot and Kivalliq regions in the fall and winter.
She released Thursday a report called ""Sick of Waiting: A Report on Nunavut's Housing Crisis,"" with data she collected during the visits along with personal accounts of what she saw.
""I needed to give myself a true understanding and a holistic perspective of what it means for an individual to not have access to safe space,"" Qaqqaq wrote in the report.
A 2019-2020 report from the Nunavut Housing Corp. said there are an estimated 3,545 families in need of housing in the territory and 56 per cent of Inuit there live in overcrowded homes.
Qaqqaq, a New Democrat elected in 2019, said she posted home visit sign-up sheets in community offices during her stays. She visited homes in several places, but the report highlights Gjoa Haven, Taloyoak, Kugaaruk, Salliq and Naujaat.
""Families shared deeply personal stories of strife within their family units because they had no space, no separation from each other. Conditions were exacerbated in the long winter months,"" Qaqqaq wrote.
""The thought that elders, adults and children continued to live there left me feeling helpless ... My people need help. They need that help now.""
In Gjoa Haven, a community of about 1,200 in western Nunavut, Qaqqaq said a typical home she saw had a minimum of six people living in it, with three usable bedrooms. And, she said, over half of public housing units in the community are in need of repairs.
The report contains photos taken by Qaqqaq and quotes from residents. But Qaqqaq said she did not identify anyone for privacy reasons.
The report quotes one Gjoa Haven woman living in a home with 12 other people.
""My sewage overflowed and only sewage was removed, it wasn't cleaned properly and mould grew and little flies appeared,"" the woman told Qaqqaq.
According to the report, home renovations in Gjoa Haven are ""sporadic"" and there is one local contractor in the community.
""One home I visited had been in desperate need of mould and sewage remediation for years, and yet the only renovations undertaken for a decade had been a new coat of paint,"" Qaqqaq wrote.
In Kugaaruk, a community of about 900 people, Qaqqaq said most homes she visited had plastic sheeting around windows to keep the cold out because they weren't properly insulated.
""Almost all units had window problems. Most windows were drafty and did not properly close, especially with ice buildup in the fall and winter,"" she wrote.
Qaqqaq also said the waiting list for social housing in Kugaaruk has grown to 100 people from 40 people over the last eight years.
""The top of the walls leak and drip into the living room and bedrooms. When mould is clearly present my mom gets skin irritations all over her body,"" a Kugaaruk woman told Qaqqaq.
Following her housing tour, Qaqqaq took a two-month leave of absence from her political duties because of ""extreme burnout, depression and anxiety,"" according to a video she posted in January.
""The visits to these homes proved to be overwhelming for me. I was devastated to see the conditions under which my constituents were living. What's worse, I heard repeatedly that they had been living under these grossly unhealthy conditions for years,"" she wrote in the report.
Qaqqaq is to hold a virtual public forum on Friday to discuss her findings.

OTTAWA -- Nunavut's sole MP says she is back on the job after several months away from work due to what she described as ""extreme burnout, depression and anxiety.""
Mumilaaq Qaqqaq announced in late October that she would be taking eight weeks off on advice from her doctor following a housing tour in Nunavut.
In a video posted to her Facebook page, Qaqqaq said the three-week tour left her ""heart hurting"" and her ""soul heavy.""
The NDP parliamentarian said Liberal and Conservative governments have failed Inuit, who continue to struggle with unaffordable food and a housing crisis that includes overcrowding and substandard materials.
Qaqqaq said higher rates of suicide and violent crime in Nunavut can be traced directly to the legacy of colonialism and residential schools, as well as ongoing complacency from Ottawa and elsewhere.
She said she has worked with the NDP to develop a wellness plan to prevent further burnout, and will spend the next few weeks building office staff capacity and reaching out to constituents.
“After the three week housing tour and seeing so much turmoil and lack of justice for Inuit I found my heart hurting and soul heavy...” — Mumilaaq Qaqqaq (@MumilaaqQaqqaq) January 5, 2021

GJOA HAVEN, NUNAVUT -- Little plant life can thrive on Nunavut’s tundra, where January days dip well below -30 C with a mere four hours of sunlight.
But life is brimming inside a collection of new “grow pods” -- Arctic greenhouses erected to produce food for the people of Gjoa Haven.
In Nunavut, groceries can cost 10 times the average Canadian amount, a reality that illustrates the growing food insecurity in the region. According to an area survey from 2007 to 2016, as many as 46 per cent of households had inadequate access to food because of financial constraints.
The new greenhouses (recycled sea containers powered by solar panels and wind turbines) were developed by Arctic Research Foundation. The private non-profit worked alongside the Department of Agriculture and Agri-Food to bring the new project to Gjoa Haven, which is home to about 1,000 people.
It’s not just a stab at a solution to high food costs -- it’s also employing a handful of residents.
“I didn’t know anything about gardening. But we know now,” Susie, one of five locals involved in the project, told CTV National News.
In November, the project produced its first harvest of lettuce, which the team delivered to elders. Cherry tomatoes are expected to ripen soon, and locals have their sights set on expanding the project.
For the Arctic Research Foundation, maintaining ties to the elders and ensuring the local community can preserve its unique local heritage are key.
“The people of the north know their backyard better than anyone else,” said CEO Adrian Schimnowski. “It’d be wise to listen and ask for direction.”
Elders would like to include some of the area’s berries and flowers in an expansion of the “grow pods” project. Typically, local vegetation can only be grown and gathered during the short summer season.
“Now I know that anything is possible,” said one elder.

IQALUIT --
Caribou stew simmers on a stove top while a staff member chops vegetables in an empty dining room, the sounds of his blade echoing off the walls as it hits the cutting board.
This is the scene at Iqaluit's Qajuqturvik Community Food Centre from Sundays to Thursdays. Nunavummiut usually arrive around noon to gather at tables and enjoy meals that can include stew, green salad and freshly baked buns. The people aren't necessarily homeless, but some of them don't always have enough to eat.
Qajuqturvik also offers a range of community programming, including cooking classes for kids, a food skills program and a pre-employment training program.
But with Nunavut in a territorywide shutdown, Qajuqturvik's dining room is closed. Public health orders restrict gatherings, so the centre has stopped its programming and meals are only available for takeout.
The shutdown started last Wednesday after COVID-19 cases started rising in the Kivalliq region on the western side of Hudson Bay. As of Tuesday, there were 142 active cases in the area, 107 of them in the community of Arviat.
There hadn't been any in the territory until the beginning of November.
All schools and non-essential businesses are shuttered. The hospital in Iqaluit and community health centres are taking patients only by appointment or in an emergency.
Wade Thorhaug, Qajuqturvik's executive director, says he's already seeing the effects of restrictions.
""Food security is always an issue for people, but I think the bigger issue now is people's mental health,"" Thorhaug said in an interview.
Statistics Canada says 57 per cent of people living in Nunavut are food insecure. Nunavut Housing Corp. figures show 56 per cent of Nunavut Inuit also live in overcrowded homes.
Thorhaug said the shutdown has left people seeking shelter with nowhere to go.
""It's hard for us to leave them in that situation, when someone is couch-surfing or doesn't have a stable place to stay or can't even come in here as a place of respite because it's not allowed.""
Thorhaug said one man was flown to Iqaluit because of a lack of housing in his community. He hoped to stay at Iqaluit's men's shelter, but it can't accept any new clients during the shutdown.
Iqaluit also has two women's shelters and a ""low-barrier"" shelter that opens from 8 p.m. to 8 a.m. each day. It's part of a harm reduction program that gives homeless people who may be under the influence of alcohol or drugs a safe place to stay.
""His only option was the low-barrier shelter ... but that leaves him with several hours where he's in a community where he doesn't know anybody, carrying around a suitcase,"" Thorhaug said.
""All institutions in the city that would have been reliable places to even just come in and warm up or just hang out for a bit are all closed.""
Thorhaug said it's important to stick to public health guidelines as the territory tries to cope with increasing cases of COVID-19.
""At the same time, we do acknowledge that there are people for whom these spaces are lifelines.""
Having a place to stay becomes even more critical as temperatures drop, he added.
""In weather like this, we do have to think about places for people to go. Not everybody has a place where they can stay for the duration of the lockdown.""
Nunavut went through a similar shutdown in the spring as the pandemic first swept across the country, but restrictions were lifted because there were no cases.
Dr. Michael Patterson, Nunavut's chief public health officer, says this second round of restrictions is likely to be lifted in regions with no cases of COVID-19 as of Dec. 2.

TORONTO -- Nunavut’s NDP MP Mumilaaq Qaqqaq is urging the government to do more to provide safe housing in her territory after she visited several communities and saw widespread mould and poor living conditions.
One year after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau visited the territory and pledged to invest millions to tackle the housing crisis, the NDP representative has launched a petition in hopes of bringing wider attention to the issue.
“We know the need for safe housing and safe spaces is immense throughout Nunavut, but to actually see it first hand is something that has been extremely eye-opening … people are basically living in mould boxes,” Qaqqaq told CTV News Channel on Saturday.
Safe and affordable housing are longstanding issues in Nunavut. For years, the Nunavut Housing Corporation has described the situation as a housing crisis due to a lack of affordable homes, the high cost of construction and cramped conditions in existing spaces. The commission found that, in 2016, 38 per cent of tenants lived in overcrowded conditions, with that number rising to 72 per cent in some communities.
Last year, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau visited the territory and pledged $290 million over eight years in conjunction with Nunavut. At the time of Trudeau’s visit, more than 4,900 people were on waiting lists for public housing.
Since then, Qaqqaq said the federal government has yet to put those goals into action.
“It’s been made very, very clear that the federal government likes to talk about reconciliation but does not, through their actions, actually value Indigenous lives and Inuit lives,” she said.
Qaqqaq said five communities she visited all have at least 100 people on a waitlist for public housing. She described the living conditions as extremely stressful since many homes will often have two bedrooms with 10 people living in them.
Qaqqaq has been documenting her tour on social media to show the water-stained homes and rusting pipes that she said haven’t been fixed because of lack of funding. She said her goal with the tour is to raise awareness in hopes of fixing the problem.

The fed govt is restricting Inuit from living in healthy homes pic.twitter.com/PZgps3SHnU — Mumilaaq Qaqqaq (@MumilaaqQaqqaq) August 14, 2020
“Of course, we’re upset but we need people to be upset with us because that’s the only time we actually see the federal government do something positive for Indigenous peoples,” she said.
Qaqqaq was elected in 2019, and she says she is focused on advocating for better living conditions for Indigenous communities and Inuit people.
“I hope that at least in my time in this position I can create awareness because the reality is that we talk about pride and being Canadian and what that means but we don’t actually talk about the dark history for Indigenous people,” she said. . FOLLOW ON

The Honourable Joe Savikataaq, M.L.A.
Minister of Community and Government Services
Government of Nunavut
P.O. Box 1200
Iqaluit, Nunavut X0A 0H0
Dear Colleague:
This letter is a follow-up to our discussion on July 5, 2017, regarding the federal government's historic infrastructure investments through the Investing in Canada plan.
I would like to express my gratitude for your continued partnership in delivering the initial phase of the Plan announced in Budget 2016, which is focused on accelerating federal investments in the short term by providing funding for the rehabilitation, repair, and modernization of existing infrastructure. In Nunavut, this included up to $51,336,803 under the Clean Water Wastewater Fund. As of July 6, 2017, 4 water and wastewater projects have been approved in your jurisdiction under this program for 100% of the funding made available.
Budget 2017 builds on these measures and clearly outlines the next phase of the Government of Canada's Investing in Canada plan, which will provide more than $180 billion in infrastructure funding over 12 years. These investments will create long-term economic growth, build inclusive, sustainable communities and support a low carbon, green economy. We are working closely with all our partners and stakeholders to deliver this ambitious plan that will make a real difference to Canadians and Canadian communities. Infrastructure Canada, along with other federal departments, such as Natural Resources Canada, Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, Economic and Social Development Canada and Transport Canada, will deliver a variety of investments that focus on five key areas: public transit; green infrastructure; social infrastructure; trade and transportation; and infrastructure in rural and northern communities.
I would also like to highlight other key ongoing elements of the Investing in Canada plan. As you know, the Gas Tax Fund was originally launched in 2005 and has since supported more the 25,000 projects across the country. The Gas Tax Fund is a flexible program that is legislated, permanent and indexed; therefore, the funding amount will grow as time goes on. I am pleased to note that municipalities in Nunavut will receive $15,750,000 this year to fund their key priorities.
I also appreciate your continued efforts on the Provincial-Territorial Infrastructure Component of the New Building Canada Fund. Last year, our government made changes to this program to facilitate expedited approval of projects. As you are aware, we are seeking to ensure that all of the remaining funding under this program is approved as quickly as possible. I am pleased to note that 100% of your National and Regional Projects allocation and 100% of your Small Communities Fund allocation have been approved for projects.
As Minister of Infrastructure and Communities, I am responsible for overall coordination and reporting on results for the Investing in Canada plan. In addition, I am directly responsible for several new initiatives under the long-term plan, which include:
- $33 billion in funding provided through Integrated Bilateral Agreements with provinces and territories that will invest in public transit infrastructure, community, culture and recreation infrastructure, green infrastructure, and infrastructure in rural and northern communities;
- Other initiatives within my portfolio that are not part of the integrated bilateral agreements include:
- The $2 billion Disaster Mitigation and Adaptation Fund, which is a national, competitive, merit-based program, designed to support investments that will mitigate current and future climate risks, such as floods, wildfires and droughts by building or reinforcing constructed and natural infrastructure;
- The Canada Infrastructure Bank, which will provide a new tool to make public dollars go farther by investing at least $35 billion in transformative projects that engage private capital, and
- The Smart Cities Challenge, which will invest $300 million to encourage cities and their most creative minds to adopt new and innovative approaches to city-building and the digitalization of urban services.
We aim to have the Canada Infrastructure Bank operational by the end of 2017, and the Smart Cities Challenge will officially launch this fall. We will also have more details on the Disaster Mitigation and Adaptation Fund in the coming months.
At this time, I am happy to provide you with details regarding the funding that will be delivered through an integrated bilateral agreement between Canada and Nunavut. This bilateral agreement will support public transit infrastructure, green infrastructure, community, culture and recreation infrastructure, as well as infrastructure in rural and northern communities. You will find below an overview of this program and additional information can be found in the Annex.
Our approach to this next phase of our government's plan to make historic investments in infrastructure will be different from what has been traditionally done in the past. We want the new programs announced in Budget 2017 to focus on outcomes that will have a positive, real impact on Canadians for generations to come. The bilateral agreement will be signed after an open dialogue between our governments and will aim to achieve the following outcomes:
- increase the rate of economic growth in an inclusive and sustainable way;
- improve environmental quality, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase resiliency of communities;
- improve mobility in Canadian communities;
- make Canadian communities more inclusive and accessible;
- manage infrastructure in a more sustainable way.
Investments made through these bilateral agreements will streamline the delivery of funding and ensure that federal investments are targeted to achieving national objectives while providing the flexibility for provinces, territories and municipalities to propose priority investments in infrastructure.
This federal investment includes four funding streams to be delivered over the next 11 years:
- $20.1 billion for public transit;
- $9.2 billion for green infrastructure;
- $1.3 billion for community, culture and recreation infrastructure; and
- $2.4 billion for wide-ranging infrastructure needs in rural and northern communities. This includes the $400 million Arctic Energy Fund, which will be delivered under this stream to support energy security in the territories.
Partnership will be key to our success, and I would like to acknowledge the strong and effective communication between our respective organizations.
Infrastructure Canada officials will be engaging with your officials in the coming weeks to lay the groundwork for negotiations and address any issues and questions you may have, with the goal of concluding negotiation of the integrated bilateral agreements by March 2018 at the latest.
I will soon be reaching out to you again to invite you to take part in the second edition of the Federal-Provincial-Territorial Ministerial meeting on infrastructure on September 20 and 21, 2017, in Ottawa, where we will have the opportunity to take stock of progress, challenges and best ways forward.
I want to extend my appreciation to you for your continued support in the implementation of this long-term program. I look forward to our continued collaboration in support of infrastructure investments through existing and new programs investments that will lead to a higher quality of life for Canadians.
Yours sincerely,
Amarjeet Sohi, P.C., M.P.
Minister of Infrastructure and Communities
Integrated Bilateral Agreement Letters Annex – Nunavut
The Government of Canada wants to make investments that maximize results. Therefore, the investments realized through the integrated bilateral agreements will be guided by the principles of transparency and accountability; fairness; a collaborative approach with partners; and effective, streamlined delivery.
The integrated bilateral agreements will allow the Government of Canada and the provinces and territories to agree on well-defined shared outcomes, targets, and a framework for reporting on results on a regular basis. Consequently, the bilateral agreements will shift to an outcomes-based approach for project eligibility.
The outcomes-based eligibility approach will be anchored in the five long-term outcomes referenced in the above letter. For each of these outcomes, there will be one or more corresponding project-delivery outcomes. Project eligibility will be determined on whether or not a project meets the specified project-delivery outcomes and complies with the terms and conditions of the applicable stream.
In addition, as support for municipal projects is a priority for the Government of Canada, part of the project approval process will include a review to ensure that a fair balance of municipal and provincial projects exists under all streams.
Key areas of investment
Public Transit Stream
The Public Transit stream will provide funding to address the construction, expansion, and improvement of public transit infrastructure, and support active transportation projects that integrate ""first-mile, last-mile"" connectivity with a public transit system.
The provincial and territorial allocation is determined by a formula based on ridership (70%) and population (30%). Given that Nunavut does not have any public transit systems, the territorial allocation based on population, which is $6,067,664, can be managed under the parameters of the Rural and Northern Communities Infrastructure stream.
Green Infrastructure Stream
The Green Infrastructure stream will be composed of three funding areas:
- Greenhouse Gas Mitigation investments that will result in reduced greenhouse gas emissions, such as electricity generation and transmission (e.g. smart grid and renewables), built environment (i.e. energy efficiency), transportation (e.g. electric vehicles and alternative fuel infrastructure), active transportation infrastructure, higher order rapid transit (e.g., heavy rail, subway, light rail transit, or bus rapid transit) or the adoption of vehicles that use a renewable fuel source (e.g. fleet electrification) in a public transit fleet;
- Adaptation, Resilience, Disaster Mitigation investments that will support community resilience, such as constructed infrastructure (e.g. dykes, winter ice roads replacement) and natural infrastructure (e.g. natural shorelines and wetlands) projects that will result in increased infrastructure capacity to withstand and adapt to climate change impacts, and climate-related disaster mitigation;
- Environmental Quality investments, such as infrastructure projects that will result in increased capacity to treat and manage water and wastewater, and capacity to reduce or remediate soil and air pollutants. Funding could include investments in natural infrastructure, as well as upgrades to water, wastewater infrastructure, replacement of diesel storage tanks, and reduction of the environmental impact of landfills.
The Green Infrastructure stream is intended to be the source of funding for projects identified by provinces and territories under the Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change. Infrastructure Canada will work with provinces and territories to prioritize the Pan-Canadian Framework projects in this stream.
The jurisdictional allocation for the Green Infrastructure stream consists of a base amount of $200 million for each province and territory. The remainder is allocated on a per capita basis, using 2016 Statistics Canada Census data.
The Green Infrastructure stream allocation for Nunavut is $207,079,637.
Community, Culture and Recreation Infrastructure Stream
The Community, Culture and Recreation Infrastructure stream will provide funding for infrastructure projects that improve social inclusion and civic engagement. Funding will support new, expanded or renewed community centres and hubs, amateur sport, cultural, and recreational installations and facilities. Priority will be placed on facilities primarily aimed at supporting vulnerable populations. A minimum funding level will be set in each jurisdiction to address infrastructure investment needs of the Indigenous population living off-reserve.
The allocation for this funding stream consists of a base amount of $25 million for each province and territory to ensure meaningful funding in smaller jurisdictions. The remainder will be allocated on a per capita basis, using 2016 Statistics Canada Census data.
The Community, Culture and Recreation Infrastructure stream allocation for Nunavut is $26,021,405.
Rural and Northern Communities Infrastructure Stream
The Rural and Northern Communities Infrastructure stream will support the unique and wide-ranging infrastructure priorities in small, rural and remote communities such as facilities that support food security, local roads, renewable energy and enhanced broadband connectivity. Projects eligible under the Public Transit, Green and Community, Culture and Recreation streams will also be eligible under the Rural and Northern Communities Infrastructure stream but only after the applicable funding from the other streams has been exhausted.
A community size threshold for funding under the Rural and Northern Communities Infrastructure stream will be determined as part of the dialogue leading to the signature of the integrated bilateral agreement, up to a maximum community size of 100,000 people.
The jurisdictional allocation of the $2 billion Rural and Northern Communities Infrastructure stream consists of a base amount of $75 million for provinces and $150 million for territories. The remainder is allocated on a per capita basis based on populations of communities under 30,000, using 2016 Statistics Canada Census data.
In addition, the $400 million Arctic Energy Fund will be delivered as part of this stream to support energy security in communities in the territories, including Indigenous communities. The Arctic Energy Fund will provide funding for communities to upgrade existing fossil fuel based energy systems or to supplement or replace these systems with renewable energy options, thus contributing to improved reliability, efficiency as well as pollution reduction.
The Rural and Northern Communities Infrastructure stream allocation for Nunavut is $152,592,915 and the allocation under the Artic Energy Fund is $175,000,000.
Cost Sharing
Under the integrated bilateral agreements, Canada will invest:
- Up to 75% of territorial, municipal, not-for-profit organization and Indigenous partners' projects;
- Up to 25% of for-profit private sector projects (except in the Community, Culture and Recreation stream, where for-profit private sector proponents are not eligible).
Investing in Indigenous Communities
The Government of Canada is committed to renewing the relationship between Canada and Indigenous peoples based on the recognition of rights, respect, co-operation, partnership and advancing the outcomes of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. This includes making infrastructure investments in Indigenous communities, which represent a significant opportunity to promote inclusive growth.
Under the integrated bilateral agreements that will be signed between the federal government and the provinces and territories, eligible Indigenous recipients include First Nations communities on-reserve, First Nations communities covered by modern treaty and/or self-government agreements, Inuit communities, Métis settlements as well as recognized Indigenous organizations (e.g. development corporations). Indigenous communities will be eligible for an increased federal contribution towards projects (up to 75%).
Outcomes-based Approach
The new outcomes-based approach will give provinces and territories, in consultation with municipalities, the flexibility to prioritize projects that meet their needs, while contributing to Government of Canada objectives. This could include innovative projects that may not have fit into eligible asset categories under previous programs.
As the integrated bilateral agreements will support a wide range of public infrastructure projects, the Government of Canada is expecting to achieve a number of outcomes across the four funding streams.
Horizontal Requirements
The new agreement will also encourage consideration of climate-related outcomes and community employment benefits. As such, a Climate Lens will be applied to these federal investments, and a Community Employment Benefits Reporting Framework will be applied for relevant programs under the Investing in Canada Plan. Both the Climate Lens and the Community Employment Benefits Reporting Framework will be developed in consultation with provinces, territories, municipalities and other stakeholders over the next few months and will be embedded in the integrated bilateral agreements once completed.
Planning and Reporting
Provinces and territories will be asked to provide a minimum three-year plan, developed in consultation with municipalities, which will form the basis for the delivery of funding in each jurisdiction. This plan will be updated on an annual basis and will become the primary tool for the planning, prioritization and approval of funding while ensuring that projects are aligned with common goals. With a clear vision of long-term needs, and more specifically, what can be achieved through our joint investments, we will be able to invest in infrastructure projects in the best way possible, benefiting Canadians for years to come. This integrated approach will combine long-term infrastructure planning, project submission for federal approval and project and program reporting.
We are committed to publicly report on the progress under this program in order to demonstrate how these investments are achieving measurable and concrete results for Canadians. Performance measures for infrastructure investments will be included in the agreements signed between the federal government and the provinces and territories. For key outcomes and results, this will include common definitions and negotiated targets. We will work collaboratively with provinces and territories to ensure that we have an effective way to measure and report on key outcomes and results over time. Information on the projects funded through the program, the Climate Lens, and the Community Employment Benefits Reporting Framework will be publicly reported on a website of the Government of Canada, in a way similar to the Public Transit Infrastructure Fund (PTIF) and Clean Water and Wastewater Fund (CWWF) programs.
The Government of Canada acknowledges there will be requirements for provinces and territories related to planning and reporting. Consequently, funding will be available to help your government cover administrative costs and program delivery. A business case will be used to identify key administrative activities and provide rationale for the amount of administration funding requested.
Combined Investments
The Government of Canada is committed to accountability. To this end, provinces and territories will be required to attest that federal funding received under the integrated bilateral agreements does not displace their infrastructure spending on each of the asset classes funded through the four streams of the new program. Provincial and territorial governments will still have the flexibility to move infrastructure investments between projects within the same asset class as required to get the most benefit from our combined investments. Planned projects already identified in a provincial, territorial or municipal long-term infrastructure plan will be eligible for funding. Provinces will be asked to attest that investments in municipal assets in the public transit stream do not displace municipal spending in this asset class.

Nunavut’s fishing and sealing industries are key economic drivers in the territory, supporting the livelihood of generations of Inuit. These industries are a source of sustainable economic development in Nunavut, providing jobs for Nunavummiut, as well as presenting a significant potential for growth. That is why the Government of Canada has been there to support the industry over the last year.
The Canadian Northern Economic Development Agency (CanNor) has long been a supporter of Nunavut’s fishing and sealing industries, recognizing their positive economic impacts in the territory. For over a decade, CanNor has worked with federal departments and partners, including the Government of Nunavut, Inuit organizations, and businesses, to invest in extensive fisheries research, marketing, and professional training.
Federal support for fisheries and sealing in Nunavut provides jobs and opportunities
Today, the Honourable Daniel Vandal, Minister of Northern Affairs, on behalf of the Honourable Mélanie Joly, Minister of Economic Development and Official Languages and Minister responsible for CanNor, met with members of Nunavut’s fishing industry, Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated, the Qikiqtani Inuit Association, and the Government of Nunavut. During that meeting, he highlighted investments of over $3.2 million that have been made to support six projects that will continue to grow and diversify Nunavut’s economy. This investment builds on CanNor’s support to the development of Nunavut’s fishing and sealing industries.
These investments support projects that are providing safe work environments for employees on vessels and in plants during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as projects that are helping to examine innovative ways to expand and promote Nunavut’s fishing and sealing industries into new markets, support exploratory fisheries (focusing on redfish and char), as well as small scale inshore fisheries exploration in the communities of Arviat, Kinngait, and Sanikiluaq. These investments will bring new jobs and opportunities for Nunavummiut.
By investing in Nunavut’s fishing and sealing industries, the Government of Canada is helping position the territory’s economy for a strong recovery, while supporting the government’s commitment to create over one million jobs across Canada, restoring employment to previous levels.

Nunavut initiatives supported by CanNor
PPE Adaptation and Shrimp Research and Marketing $1,550,000
CanNor is investing $1,550,000 with the Nunavut Fisheries Association providing $100,000 and the Government of Nunavut providing $50,000 in a one-year project. Total cost of the project is $1.7 million. The project is helping Nunavut’s fishing industry deal with the impacts of COVID-19 while preparing for it to rebound in 2021. It supported investments in Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and other health and safety measures for in-plant and on-vessel operations. This included disinfectant fogging of vessels, barriers to promote social distancing and designating isolation areas on vessels. A state-of-the-art set of safety protocols was also created for each vessel.
The pandemic has also created significant issues in the hospitality and food sectors worldwide. This project includes support for branding, market research and strategic marketing to promote Nunavut’s shrimp industry in China, Japan, and Europe.
Establishing a ringed seal Omega-3 Industry in Nunavut $111,500
Feasibility Evaluation
CanNor is investing $111,500 with the Qikiqtaaluk Corporation (QC) providing $30,000 and the Government of Nunavut investing $72,150 in a one-year pilot project. Total cost of the project is $213,650. As part of the project, QC will pilot an Omega-3 extraction process in the Qikiqtani region from the under-utilized blubber of ringed seals. If the pilot project is successful, the next phase will be the development of an Omega-3 extraction industry using harvested ring seal blubber within Nunavut. The pilot project is expected to expand 10-15 harvesting jobs and result in the production of a market acceptability study, feasibility study, business development plan, as well as a clinical research protocol.
Small Scale Fisheries Development in Nunavut $335,617
CanNor is investing $335,617 with the World Wildlife Fund-Canada providing $195,259 towards a two-year small scale fisheries development project. Total cost of the project is $530,876. This project consists of exploratory inshore fisheries research to develop small scale community-owned commercial fisheries in Arviat, Kinngait, and Sanikiluaq. In partnership with the Arviat Hunters and Trappers Organization, the Aiviq Hunters and Trappers Association and the Sanikiluaq Hunters and Trappers Association, the project will identify fishing opportunities and establish potential markets for harvesters. The project is expected to provide direct employment opportunities within Nunavut communities, potentially creating up to 35 jobs.
Exploratory Fishing Char $107,700
CanNor is investing $107,700 with the Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) contributing $21,000, and Kabva Marine Services & Contracting Ltd. adding $86,700 for a three-year test fishery project. Total funding for the project is $215,400. This project will establish test fisheries at two locations in Frobisher Bay – York Sound and Kendall Straits – with the goal of establishing a commercial char quota. Kabva will provide the boats and crews, work with DFO to process the catch and manage the delivery method from the catch site in Iqaluit. Kabva will sell the end product to the Iqaluit Hunters and Trappers Organization and other vendors. This project is expected to support the local employment of 12-14 fishermen over the duration of the project, with potential for additional, longer-term employment opportunities if a commercial quota is established.
Redfish Emerging/Exploratory Fishery Project $750,000
CanNor is investing $750,000 with a further investment of $300,000 from the Government of Nunavut and Qikiqtaaluk Corporation investing $330,000 towards a three-year project to undertake a multi-year exploratory offshore fishery project for redfish in the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization’s (NAFO) Division 0 (Baffin Bay & Davis Strait). Total cost of the project is $1,380,000. This project will determine if redfish are present in commercially harvestable concentrations. If this project determines that there are enough redfish to support a commercial fishery, QC will consider potentially expanding its fleet to take advantage of the opportunity. This exploratory project is expected to result in 20-30 new full-time jobs for Inuit and create greater revenues and profits.
Advancing Nunavut’s Fisheries and Sealing Economies $380,000
CanNor is investing $380,000 with the Government of Nunavut providing $394,750, the Department of Fisheries and Oceans investing $312,200, the Ocean Tracking Network contributing $113,680, the Fur Harvesters Auction contributing $100,000, the Seals and Sealing Network adding $25,000 and Baffin Fisheries adding $31,550. Total cost of the project is $1,357,180. The one-year project will conduct fisheries research and training, as well as improve market access and awareness of the sealing products sector. It will also improve Inuit capacity, employment and training in Nunavut’s fishing and sealing industries. This project is expected to create 14 direct jobs for this year with the aim for future employment retention and expansion of economic opportunities for Nunavummiut. .

modernfarmer,https://modernfarmer.com/2013/10/arctic-farming/ https://modernfarmer.com/2013/10/arctic-farming/ https://modernfarmer.com/2013/10/arctic-farming/ ,"The reasons are many. For one, the climate is changing: Arctic temperatures over the past 100 years have increased at almost twice the global average.
The diet of many indigenous Arctic peoples is also changing: Traditionally meat-eaters, groups like the Inuit are now consuming more grains and vegetables. And as is happening further south in the United States and Canada, there’s budding demand for locally grown foods.
Non-local-vegetables and other foods are shipped long distances and cost a fortune, $28 for a head of cabbage in some instances.
But perhaps most significant is the fact that Arctic and sub-Arctic communities are isolated: Vegetables and other foods are shipped long distances and cost a fortune, $28 for a head of cabbage in some instances. Not to mention, these supply chains are vulnerable to the region’s litany of both natural and human-made disasters, including blizzards, earthquakes, volcanoes and shipping strikes.
“Currently there’s only one road that comes to Alaska,” says Shipka. “A few years ago that road was wiped out in a storm, within a couple days our grocery store shelves were going empty.”
Greenhouses in Nunavut
The only way to get vegetables to Nunavut’s 29,000 people, 85 percent of whom are Inuit, is by ship or plane. But ships come only a few times a year and summer fog and winter storms can ground planes for weeks at a time, leaving stores barren of staples like milk and bread. Groceries are also shockingly expensive.
This summer activists rallied outside grocery stores in several Nunavut communities, including Iqaluit, the territory’s capital, demanding cheaper food. The food security advocacy group Feeding My Family has photos on their Facebook page of $14 orange juice cartons and $55 frozen steaks. A report recently presented to the Nunavut legislature stated that nearly three-quarters of Inuit preschoolers live in food-insecure homes.
“I do not want any kids going to bed hungry,” Leesee Papatsie, head of the Feeding My Family group recently posted on Facebook. “We cannot rely on the government,” she added. “We have to make the changes ourselves.”
Some projects are in the works. Entrepreneur Nathan Lawlor has plans to build a series of geodesic domes in the Nunavut community of Pangnirtung, which, he says, will produce more than 3,000 pounds of fruits and vegetables a year. Although Lawlor has miles to go before his project becomes a reality, his idea shifts the dialogue around food security. And there are precedents.
In Inuvik, a community in Canada’s Northwest Territories, an old hockey arena was transformed into a multi-level greenhouse that has been successfully growing veggies for more than a decade. And in Iqaluit, a much smaller community greenhouse boasts tomatoes, peppers, spinach, kale, radishes and carrots.
“In issues of food security, every little bit counts,” says Suzanne Etheridge, treasurer of the Iqaluit Community Greenhouse Society. Although Iqaluit’s average January temperature is -16° Fahrenheit, come June and July the snow is gone and the sun is up for 18 to 20 hours a day. Summer temperatures occasionally drop below zero, but barrels of water keep greenhouse air warmer and plastic coverings protect vulnerable crops like peppers. On summer Fridays, members hold crop-picking parties, and on weekends they deliver vegetables to a local soup kitchen, as well as a women’s shelter.
But soil for the greenhouse must be shipped from southern Canada, and maintenance is costly, which means greenhouse fees are high too ”“ as much as $90 a year. Another issue is tradition. Other than seaweed, berries and certain herbs, greens have never been part of the Inuit diet. “Even if that cabbage cost $2,” Nunavut’s territorial nutritionist, Jennifer Wakegijig recently reported to the Canadian Press, “there’s no guarantee the Inuit mother would buy it.”
But Etheridge pointed out those cultural norms are changing. Iqaluit’s Greenhouse Society now has Inuit members. “It’s not that the Inuit are against growing food,” says Etheridge. “It’s just they need to learn more about how to do it. The Inuit are trying to adapt, and that is something they are very good at.”
Community Gardens in Yellowknife
In Yellowknife, capitol of Canada’s Northwest Territories, Lone Sorensen has been growing vegetables for more than 20 years. In the mid-1990s Sorensen, originally from Denmark, founded a local food advocacy group called Northern Roots.
“Part of the belief system in place is that people think we can’t grow things up here,” said Sorensen. Not only is that untrue – Sorensen is presently growing cauliflower, broccoli, kale, potatoes, zucchini and peas outside, and tomatoes, eggplants, cucumbers and mint in a greenhouse — residents of Yellowknife once grew their own food. In the 1930s, gold mines opened and home gardens provided workers with greens and potatoes. But cheap fuel after World War II led to a reliance on shipped goods and local farming dwindled. Sorensen is not starting an Arctic green revolution, she is merely resuscitating one.
Sorensen has set up gardening programs in local schools and nearby First Nation communities and teaches gardening workshops for adults. This summer, Yellowknife hosted a weekly farmer’s market and new gardening collectives are springing up across the city. As in Iqaluit, the last Ice Age’s glaciers have scraped the land clear and obtaining good soil is problematic. Soil exists in river deltas but most planters don’t have access to those areas and get their soil from contractors, a system that is not necessarily environmentally sustainable. Still, Sorensen believes Yellowknife can overcome the obstacles and eventually foster enough community gardeners to become food secure.
“There is something magical that happens inside the brain when people taste local food grown without poisons or pesticides,” says Sorensen. “And there is an entire generation that has never had that experience.”
Potatoes, Sheep and Strawberries in Greenland
A thick ice sheet covers 80 percent of Greenland, but on the southwestern coast warm currents bring summer temperatures into the low 60s and daylight lasts for 24 hours. A thousand years ago the Vikings had farms here, and for much of the last century many Greenlanders have had them too, focusing mostly on sheep and potatoes. Still, there are the perennial Arctic agriculture problems: poor soil, unpredictable climate and high supply costs. Recently, Greenland has faced a new problem: water shortages. Although climate change has meant warmer summers, they are also drier.
Aqqalooraq Frederiksen, head of the Greenlandic Agriculture Advisory Service for Southwestern Greenland, is Greenlandic Inuit and grew up on a sheep farm. Most of the nation’s 20,000 sheep are farmed in fjords, where steep mountains and rugged shores act as natural fences. Still, fields are filled with stones and fodder is imported from Denmark. Frederiksen says more farms are experimenting with lettuce, cabbage and potatoes. “We are trying to develop more agriculture in Southwest Greenland,” says Frederiksen. “But we need more money – it is expensive to start farming.”
Dr. Peter Stougaard, a University of Copenhagen microbiologist is more optimistic. He discovered that a certain bacterium present in Greenland’s potatoes prevents the pathogenic potato fungi that can wipe out entire crops back in Denmark. Although he worries warming could affect the bacterium and allow Greenland to lose its’ potato edge, Stougaard thinks Greenland could successfully ramp up production of potatoes and other crops. The question is, are the people and government of Greenland up for the task? “There’s a big potential,” said Stougaard, “but at the moment they are not fulfilling this potential.”
‘It is a very special land. All the vegetables are sweet, even the radishes and turnips are sweet. You should taste them.’
There is one man successfully farming nearly two dozen different vegetables in Greenland, a burly Dane named Sten Pedersen. His farm, which he started in 1977, is in an isolated fjord 43 miles to the south of Nuuk, Greenland’s capitol. To account for the recent dry summers Pedersen has built his own water collection and irrigation systems. He uses fish carcasses and seaweed as fertilizer and sleeps in a small structure in the middle of his garden, which contains turnips, kale, cabbage, cauliflower, three kinds of potatoes, three kinds of onions, spinach, parsley, thyme, rhubarb, celery, beets, carrots and yes, even strawberries. Greens are sold to a local restaurant in Nuuk.
“It is a very special land,” said Pedersen. “All the vegetables are sweet, even the radishes and turnips are sweet. You should taste them.”
Barley in Alaska
In 1983, Bryce Wrigley moved from Idaho to Delta Junction, Alaska to grow barley. Immediately, he faced challenges. There was nowhere to store his grain, no one to market it for him and machine parts were near impossible to find. The upside: he doesn’t have to worry about crop pests like weevils.
Wrigley now farms barley on a 1,700-acre farm under the majestic Alaska Range, but the state’s isolation, and images of people going hungry after Hurricane Katrina, got him thinking about how long it would take Alaska to get food in a natural disaster. After all, New Orleans is in the heart of the United States’ southern farming belt. And there are many ways a disaster could happen in Alaska, from volcanoes, crippling winter storms and earthquakes to events like in 1989, when the port of Anchorage froze up. And what about a disaster that affected the entire nation, like say a disease outbreak?
“When you are freezing your body restricts blood flow to the extremities to keep the core warm,” explained Wrigley. “Translate that to the nation, and Alaska is an extremity.”
So Wrigley, who is president of the Alaska Farm Bureau, has pushed the issue of food security. But when he brought his concern to state legislators he learned that their idea of food security was not to ramp up farming, but to warehouse $4 million worth of instant meal kits.
Wrigley isn’t waiting for legislative action. In the true spirit of Alaska, he has decided to go it alone. In 2011 his farm established a barley mill, and now sells barley flour and cream of barley cereal in about 20 supermarkets around the state under their own brand, the Alaska Flour Company.

The year 2020 marks the beginning of another little ice age.(Grand Solar Minimal) This can be expected to last fifty years. Just read the weather reports beginning about 1650. The great Winter began in sixteen forty-nine. Arctic conditions expanded all the way to the Yucatan. Even the Nile River froze over. Droughts were extended for years. Winters will be extended to five months while Some places will go years without any rain while many areas the landscape was sterilized by intense summer heat and drought. It will take about ten years for us to fully realize what is upon us.

It is mandatory to procure user consent prior to running these cookies on your website. . The reasons are many. For one, the climate is changing: Arctic temperatures over the past 100 years have increased at almost twice the global average.
The diet of many indigenous Arctic peoples is also changing: Traditionally meat-eaters, groups like the Inuit are now consuming more grains and vegetables. And as is happening further south in the United States and Canada, there’s budding demand for locally grown foods.
Non-local-vegetables and other foods are shipped long distances and cost a fortune, $28 for a head of cabbage in some instances.
But perhaps most significant is the fact that Arctic and sub-Arctic communities are isolated: Vegetables and other foods are shipped long distances and cost a fortune, $28 for a head of cabbage in some instances. Not to mention, these supply chains are vulnerable to the region’s litany of both natural and human-made disasters, including blizzards, earthquakes, volcanoes and shipping strikes.
“Currently there’s only one road that comes to Alaska,” says Shipka. “A few years ago that road was wiped out in a storm, within a couple days our grocery store shelves were going empty.”
Greenhouses in Nunavut
The only way to get vegetables to Nunavut’s 29,000 people, 85 percent of whom are Inuit, is by ship or plane. But ships come only a few times a year and summer fog and winter storms can ground planes for weeks at a time, leaving stores barren of staples like milk and bread. Groceries are also shockingly expensive.
This summer activists rallied outside grocery stores in several Nunavut communities, including Iqaluit, the territory’s capital, demanding cheaper food. The food security advocacy group Feeding My Family has photos on their Facebook page of $14 orange juice cartons and $55 frozen steaks. A report recently presented to the Nunavut legislature stated that nearly three-quarters of Inuit preschoolers live in food-insecure homes.
“I do not want any kids going to bed hungry,” Leesee Papatsie, head of the Feeding My Family group recently posted on Facebook. “We cannot rely on the government,” she added. “We have to make the changes ourselves.”
Some projects are in the works. Entrepreneur Nathan Lawlor has plans to build a series of geodesic domes in the Nunavut community of Pangnirtung, which, he says, will produce more than 3,000 pounds of fruits and vegetables a year. Although Lawlor has miles to go before his project becomes a reality, his idea shifts the dialogue around food security. And there are precedents.
In Inuvik, a community in Canada’s Northwest Territories, an old hockey arena was transformed into a multi-level greenhouse that has been successfully growing veggies for more than a decade. And in Iqaluit, a much smaller community greenhouse boasts tomatoes, peppers, spinach, kale, radishes and carrots.
“In issues of food security, every little bit counts,” says Suzanne Etheridge, treasurer of the Iqaluit Community Greenhouse Society. Although Iqaluit’s average January temperature is -16° Fahrenheit, come June and July the snow is gone and the sun is up for 18 to 20 hours a day. Summer temperatures occasionally drop below zero, but barrels of water keep greenhouse air warmer and plastic coverings protect vulnerable crops like peppers. On summer Fridays, members hold crop-picking parties, and on weekends they deliver vegetables to a local soup kitchen, as well as a women’s shelter.
But soil for the greenhouse must be shipped from southern Canada, and maintenance is costly, which means greenhouse fees are high too ”“ as much as $90 a year. Another issue is tradition. Other than seaweed, berries and certain herbs, greens have never been part of the Inuit diet. “Even if that cabbage cost $2,” Nunavut’s territorial nutritionist, Jennifer Wakegijig recently reported to the Canadian Press, “there’s no guarantee the Inuit mother would buy it.”
But Etheridge pointed out those cultural norms are changing. Iqaluit’s Greenhouse Society now has Inuit members. “It’s not that the Inuit are against growing food,” says Etheridge. “It’s just they need to learn more about how to do it. The Inuit are trying to adapt, and that is something they are very good at.”
Community Gardens in Yellowknife
In Yellowknife, capitol of Canada’s Northwest Territories, Lone Sorensen has been growing vegetables for more than 20 years. In the mid-1990s Sorensen, originally from Denmark, founded a local food advocacy group called Northern Roots.
“Part of the belief system in place is that people think we can’t grow things up here,” said Sorensen. Not only is that untrue – Sorensen is presently growing cauliflower, broccoli, kale, potatoes, zucchini and peas outside, and tomatoes, eggplants, cucumbers and mint in a greenhouse — residents of Yellowknife once grew their own food. In the 1930s, gold mines opened and home gardens provided workers with greens and potatoes. But cheap fuel after World War II led to a reliance on shipped goods and local farming dwindled. Sorensen is not starting an Arctic green revolution, she is merely resuscitating one.
Sorensen has set up gardening programs in local schools and nearby First Nation communities and teaches gardening workshops for adults. This summer, Yellowknife hosted a weekly farmer’s market and new gardening collectives are springing up across the city. As in Iqaluit, the last Ice Age’s glaciers have scraped the land clear and obtaining good soil is problematic. Soil exists in river deltas but most planters don’t have access to those areas and get their soil from contractors, a system that is not necessarily environmentally sustainable. Still, Sorensen believes Yellowknife can overcome the obstacles and eventually foster enough community gardeners to become food secure.
“There is something magical that happens inside the brain when people taste local food grown without poisons or pesticides,” says Sorensen. “And there is an entire generation that has never had that experience.”
Potatoes, Sheep and Strawberries in Greenland
A thick ice sheet covers 80 percent of Greenland, but on the southwestern coast warm currents bring summer temperatures into the low 60s and daylight lasts for 24 hours. A thousand years ago the Vikings had farms here, and for much of the last century many Greenlanders have had them too, focusing mostly on sheep and potatoes. Still, there are the perennial Arctic agriculture problems: poor soil, unpredictable climate and high supply costs. Recently, Greenland has faced a new problem: water shortages. Although climate change has meant warmer summers, they are also drier.
Aqqalooraq Frederiksen, head of the Greenlandic Agriculture Advisory Service for Southwestern Greenland, is Greenlandic Inuit and grew up on a sheep farm. Most of the nation’s 20,000 sheep are farmed in fjords, where steep mountains and rugged shores act as natural fences. Still, fields are filled with stones and fodder is imported from Denmark. Frederiksen says more farms are experimenting with lettuce, cabbage and potatoes. “We are trying to develop more agriculture in Southwest Greenland,” says Frederiksen. “But we need more money – it is expensive to start farming.”
Dr. Peter Stougaard, a University of Copenhagen microbiologist is more optimistic. He discovered that a certain bacterium present in Greenland’s potatoes prevents the pathogenic potato fungi that can wipe out entire crops back in Denmark. Although he worries warming could affect the bacterium and allow Greenland to lose its’ potato edge, Stougaard thinks Greenland could successfully ramp up production of potatoes and other crops. The question is, are the people and government of Greenland up for the task? “There’s a big potential,” said Stougaard, “but at the moment they are not fulfilling this potential.”
‘It is a very special land. All the vegetables are sweet, even the radishes and turnips are sweet. You should taste them.’
There is one man successfully farming nearly two dozen different vegetables in Greenland, a burly Dane named Sten Pedersen. His farm, which he started in 1977, is in an isolated fjord 43 miles to the south of Nuuk, Greenland’s capitol. To account for the recent dry summers Pedersen has built his own water collection and irrigation systems. He uses fish carcasses and seaweed as fertilizer and sleeps in a small structure in the middle of his garden, which contains turnips, kale, cabbage, cauliflower, three kinds of potatoes, three kinds of onions, spinach, parsley, thyme, rhubarb, celery, beets, carrots and yes, even strawberries. Greens are sold to a local restaurant in Nuuk.
“It is a very special land,” said Pedersen. “All the vegetables are sweet, even the radishes and turnips are sweet. You should taste them.”
Barley in Alaska
In 1983, Bryce Wrigley moved from Idaho to Delta Junction, Alaska to grow barley. Immediately, he faced challenges. There was nowhere to store his grain, no one to market it for him and machine parts were near impossible to find. The upside: he doesn’t have to worry about crop pests like weevils.
Wrigley now farms barley on a 1,700-acre farm under the majestic Alaska Range, but the state’s isolation, and images of people going hungry after Hurricane Katrina, got him thinking about how long it would take Alaska to get food in a natural disaster. After all, New Orleans is in the heart of the United States’ southern farming belt. And there are many ways a disaster could happen in Alaska, from volcanoes, crippling winter storms and earthquakes to events like in 1989, when the port of Anchorage froze up. And what about a disaster that affected the entire nation, like say a disease outbreak?
“When you are freezing your body restricts blood flow to the extremities to keep the core warm,” explained Wrigley. “Translate that to the nation, and Alaska is an extremity.”
So Wrigley, who is president of the Alaska Farm Bureau, has pushed the issue of food security. But when he brought his concern to state legislators he learned that their idea of food security was not to ramp up farming, but to warehouse $4 million worth of instant meal kits.
Wrigley isn’t waiting for legislative action. In the true spirit of Alaska, he has decided to go it alone. In 2011 his farm established a barley mill, and now sells barley flour and cream of barley cereal in about 20 supermarkets around the state under their own brand, the Alaska Flour Company.

asc-csa,https://asc-csa.gc.ca/eng/sciences/food-production/naurvik-project-in-nunavut.asp ,"Naurvik project in Nunavut
Background
The Naurvik project (""
the growing place "" in Inuktitut) is a community-led hydroponic food production system in Gjoa Haven, Nunavut – a small community located about 250 km north of the Arctic Circle. Winters in Gjoa Haven are long, cold and windy, with temperatures dipping to -40 °C. As in many northern communities, high-quality, fresh, affordable produce may not always be available.
How it works
pods""—the Grow Pod, Research Pod, and Power Pod. The system is powered almost entirely by renewable energy sources such as wind and solar in order to sustainably grow fresh food year-round.
Objectives
The Naurvik partners are currently researching the best ways to incorporate local crops and berries into the system to be grown in the near future. The Naurvik system is tended by local technicians trained on the job in hydroponics, controlled environment food production, and environmental control systems.
Training and capacity development
The CSA recently contracted two companies to develop a training program for Naurvik's local technicians that draws on both traditional and Western knowledge. Arctic Fresh Inc., an Inuit-owned social enterprise, and The Growcer Inc., which has expertise in northern agriculture solutions, share the mandate of fighting food insecurity and building local capacity to empower individuals and communities. The training will enhance local technicians' understanding of safety and technical practices, which will help ensure operations and research excellence. The overall goal of the Naurvik project is to produce a variety of nutritious fresh food in a harsh environment, and to share that knowledge with other communities and future generations.
Timeline
The Naurvik facility began operations in and will continue to be improved through with new technologies and innovative research.
Impacts on Earth
The CSA works to ensure that space science and technology make life better for Canadians and help solve everyday challenges on Earth. The Naurvik project is an initial step towards achieving that objective. By working with community members and partners, the CSA can support opportunities related to Arctic food security, green energy, nutrition, health, infrastructure and technology. The integration of Inuit knowledge into Naurvik makes this project unique and adapted to the needs of the community.

By (CP) Emma Tranter
IQALUIT, Nunavut – Naymen Inuarak stands on a road that sees trucks carry iron ore from a mine on the north side of Nunavut’s Baffin Island before sending it out to sea.
On Thursday night, after travelling about 150 kilometres by snowmobile over two days, Inuarak and other hunters from Pond Inlet and Arctic Bay blocked that road and an air strip used to fly workers in and out of the Mary River mine site.
The mine, owned by Baffinland Iron Mines Corp., wants to double its output to 12 million tonnes from six million tonnes and build a 110-kilometre railway to take the ore out to the coast. The railway would be the only one in Nunavut and the most northern one in Canada.
Inuarak, his group and other community members are against the proposed expansion and worry about its effects on wildlife and the environment.
Inuarak said he also believes community voices aren’t being heard by the mining company and their regional Inuit organization.
“We’ve been left out and ignored. We’re taking our own steps now,” Inuarak said in an interview over satellite phone.
Seven hunters have set up tents on the road and are also taking shelter in a hunter’s nearby cabin, he said.
Others will be joining them, he added. They do not have a timeline for how long they plan to block the road and the airstrip.
“This is just the beginning for us.”
Baffinland said in a news release Friday that it has been in communication with the hunters and is aware of the blockades.
“Baffinland respects the right to peacefully protest and continues to work with the hunting party to maintain the safety of everyone at Mary River,” it said.
Public hearings before the Nunavut Impact Review Board are underway in Pond Inlet and Iqaluit this week on the mine’s proposed expansion. The hearings are to continue in March and, once complete, the review board will send a report to the federal minister of northern affairs recommending whether it should go ahead.
Inuarak said the mine has already affected wildlife normally harvested and relied on for food by Inuit in the area.
Among the communities’ concerns are that caribou will not be able to cross the proposed railway and increased ship traffic will drive away marine mammals.
The mine’s shipping port, in Milne Inlet, opens onto narwhal habitat and lies within Tallurutiup Imanga, a national marine conservation area. The proposed expansion would see 176 ships travel in and out of Milne Inlet each year.
“There’s hardly any marine mammals now in the Pond Inlet area. There used to be so many,” Inuarak said.
“If they start doing 12 million tonnes a year, our marine mammals will be completely extinguished in our area.”
Baffinland has said their expansion plans will include mitigation measures to protect wildlife, such as caribou crossings on the railway and reduced ship speeds to minimize disturbances to marine life.
The company has also signed a benefit agreement worth $1 billion over the life of the mine with the Qikitani Inuit Association, the regional Inuit organization that represents the affected communities.
The agreement will only take effect if the expansion is approved. . ",False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False

But perhaps we should not be too surprised.
Following the last federal election campaign Prime Minister designate Stephen Harper pounced on comments by David Wilkins, the US ambassador to Canada, reaffirming Washington’s long-standing view that the Northwest Passage is an international strait through which international ship- ping has the right of passage. Harper admonished the ambas- sador and the United States for failing to recognize Canada’s Arctic sovereignty, saying: ”œWe have significant plans for national defence and for defence of our sovereignty, includ- ing Arctic sovereignty…It is the Canadian people we get our mandate from, not the ambassador from the United States.”
Prime Minister Harper toured the three territories in summer 2006 and again in summer 2007, delivering policy speeches in which Arctic sovereignty featured prominently. Deploying newly promised ice-strengthened navy patrol boats operating out of a yet-to-be-constructed deepwater port at Arctic Bay to assert sovereignty was a natural fit for a government that came to power with a mandate to rebuild and reinvest in the military.
It seems ironic, however, that current efforts to assert Arctic sovereignty are driven by melting sea ice opening the Northwest Passage. Until very recently, the Prime Minister was in the camp of the climate change deniers. His government has yet to bring forward a policy on adaptation to the unavoidable impacts of climate change. Nor does the Government of Canada yet appreciate the opportunity to use the 1993 Nunavut Land Claims Agreement (NLCA) ”” the only modern treaty to specifically mention Arctic sovereignty ”” to bolster Canada’s Arctic sovereignty.
Canada has a tradition of asserting Arctic sovereignty primarily in reaction to assumed and real challenges: The unwelcome voyages through the Northwest Passage of SS Manhattan in 1969 and 1970, and the US Coast Guard icebreaker Polar Sea in 1985 readily come to mind. Promises made in the heat of sovereignty challenges to build a Polar Class 8 icebreaker and deploy a subsurface surveillance system across the passage from Cornwallis Island to Somerset Island were abandoned as too expensive when the media and public interest moved on to other issues.
In August 2007 two Russian mini- submarines planted a titanium Russian flag on the floor of the Arctic Ocean at the North Pole, symbolically claiming sovereignty over the seabed northward of Russia’s 200-nautical-mile exclusive economic zone. Responding to vivid images on the television, Peter MacKay, then minister of foreign affairs and international trade, dismissed this as ”œjust a show.” Perhaps it was, but when responding he confused two issues: international shipping rights, if any, in the Northwest Passage, and extension by rim states of their continental shelf rights deep in the Arctic Ocean through a process defined in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). His over-the-top characterization of Russia’s action as reminiscent of how states acted in the 15th century was not balanced by an announcement on an alternative Canadian approach.
More embarrassment followed. It was revealed in The Globe and Mail in August 2007 that Canada was relying upon a Russian icebreaker as the platform from which to collect data to support its own Arctic Ocean conti- nental shelf submission. In response, Rob Huebert of the University of Calgary pithily commented, ”œIf you’re building a court case, do you depend on the opposing side for the sources of your argument?”
Jacob Verhoef, the head of Canada’s scientific data collection effort, warned that Canada’s submission, due by 2013, 10 years after Canada ratified UNCLOS, might be lacking. It seemed that Canada was now paying the price for failing to build the Polar Class 8 icebreaker and for delays in starting data collection to sup- port its claim. Had Canada thought ahead when, in the mid-1990s, decisions were taken to ratify UNCLOS at some time in the future? Apparently not.
Generally there has been a warm response in the North as well as nationally to the Prime Minister’s commitment to assert Canada’s Arctic sovereignty, although what’s at stake is poorly understood, and some worry that sovereignty assertion through navy patrol vessels signals the remilitarization of the North.
Numerous commentators have pressed the Government of Canada to modernize and expand Canada’s fleet of icebreakers and to use the coast guard rather than the navy for Arctic sovereignty assertion. But it was the Prime Minister himself who revealed the reasoning as well as the intent of the Government of Canada in July 2007 when he announced the Arctic patrol ships and deepwater port: ”œCanada has a choice when it comes to defending our sovereignty over the Arctic. We either use it or lose it. And make no mistake, this Government intends to use it.”
But this is simply wrong. Far from being a wilderness unoccupied by people, the Arctic is known, named and used by Inuit ”” Canadian citizens ”” and by a small but growing number of arrivals from the south. Inuit trace their use of this region back thousands of years through Thule, Dorset and Pre-Dorset peoples.
Canadian Inuit and Canada’s Arctic sovereignty have invariably been linked. In the 1950s Inuit families from northern Quebec were relocated to Resolute on Cornwallis Island and Grise Fiord on Ellesmere Island. While the reasons for this relocation have been hotly debat- ed, sovereignty assertion is thought by many to be one reason for the move. In 1970 a Canadian Inuit hunter and dog team from Resolute stood boldly in front of SS Manhattan as it plowed through pack ice on its historic voyage ”” it stopped. A point had been made.
The Arctic Waters Pollution Prevention Act ”” Canada’s prime response to the Manhattan incident ”” invoked the need to protect the envi- ronment upon which Inuit depended out to 100 miles from the coast. In 1985 Inuvialuit as well as Canadian national- ists from the south were on board a small plane that buzzed the Polar Sea dropping politically charged notes from the sky politely but firmly reminding the crew of Canada’s Arctic sovereignty. In the aftermath of the Polar Sea inci- dent the late Mark R. Gordon, an Inuit leader from northern Quebec, said Inuit would hold up the Canadian flag in the Arctic. And still today Inuit leaders remain fully supportive of Canada’s Arctic sovereignty. Mary Simon, President of Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, the national Inuit organization, conducted a Canada-wide tour late in 2007 to engage and inform Canadians on Arctic sovereignty and to gain public support for Inuit involvement in this issue.
The geographical extent of Inuit land and resource use in the Arctic has been well known for many years. In 1973 the Government of Canada announced the resumption of modern treaty negoti- ations with Aboriginal peoples whose right to land has not been extinguished by earlier treaties or superseded by law. Inuit of the Northwest Territories were first in line. Before commencing negotia- tions the Government of Canada demanded evidence of the extent, inten- sity and frequency of land and resource use in order to define the area subject to negotiation. This was duly provided in the three-volume report of the Inuit Land Use and Occupancy Project, published in 1977 by the Minister of Supply and Services Canada.
A classic in the field and still fre- quently quoted, this study drew upon interviews with more than 80 percent of Inuit hunters and definitively illustrated use and occupancy by Inuit in the Northwest Territories and a small portion of northern Yukon of 3.8 million square kilometres of land and ocean, used inter- changeably. For Inuit, sea ice is a plat- form used for travel between communities and to favoured hunting sites, often at the floe edge. Separate stud- ies addressed Inuit land use and occupan- cy in northern Quebec and Labrador. The 1977 Inuit Land Use and Occupancy Project demonstrated Inuit use and occu- pancy of Lancaster Sound and Barrow Strait ”” the eastern end of the Northwest Passage ”” the very area characterized by the United States and some European countries as an international strait.
In response to the Polar Sea voyage, Canada drew straight baselines from the outer edge of the coast and fringing islands enclosing the Arctic Archipelago and declared waters within the baselines to be internal waters over which Canada has full rights to regulate and potentially to exclude shipping. The results of the Inuit Land Use and Occupancy Project pro- vided support for this legal move by helping Canada to claim historic title to the area. Lawyers from the Department of Justice knew all about the Inuit Land Use and Occupancy Project. Speaking on the floor of the House of Commons in 1985, Joe Clark, Minister of External Relations, waxed eloquent: ”œCanada’s sovereign- ty in the Arctic is indivisible. It embraces land, sea and ice. It extends without interruption to the seaward facing coasts of the Arctic Islands. These islands are joined and not divided by the waters between them.”
Considerable and ongoing politi- cal support has been provided by Inuit to Canada’s Arctic sovereignty over many years. Many Canadian Inuit leaders are well known and well respected internationally. Their voices carry moral weight that complements efforts by Canadian diplomats to per- suade other countries to our view. Notwithstanding, the Government of Canada has yet to effectively engage Inuit in Arctic sovereignty assertion and by failing to fully implement the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement is forsaking a potential trump card in this complex international game.
Following more than 20 years of negotiation, the Inuit of Nunavut and Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada ratified in 1993 the NCLA ”” a modern treaty within the meaning of section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982. Promises made in this agreement are guaranteed in Canada’s constitution and enforceable in the courts. Through the agreement Inuit ceded, released and sur- rendered to the Crown their Aboriginal title, rights, claims and interests to lands and waters within Canada and received in return a wide range of rights applicable throughout the Nunavut Settlement Area, including wildlife harvesting and repre- sentation on institutions of public government to man- age and regulate the use of land, water, oceans, wildlife and natural resources. The Government of Nunavut was established in 1999 as a result of a promise in the NCLA.
The parties agreed to exchange Aboriginal title for defined rights and ben- efits ”œin recognition of the contributions of Inuit to Canada’s history, identity and sovereignty in the Arctic.” Article 15 dealing with marine areas adds: ”œCanada’s sov- ereignty over the waters of the Arctic Archipelago is supported by Inuit use and occupancy.” Inuit have negotiated four comprehensive land claims agreements covering northern Quebec (1975), the Beaufort Sea region (1984), Nunavut (1993) and northern Labrador (2004). All support Canada’s Arctic sovereignty gener- ally, but only the NCLA explicitly addresses Arctic sovereignty.
Implementation of this agreement is an ongoing expression of a negotiated partnership between the Government of Canada and the Inuit of Nunavut and could be an important component of a strategy to assert, affirm and express Canada’s Arctic sovereignty. But at pres- ent this is not the case.
The President of Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated (NTI), the Inuit organ- ization with the mandate to implement the NCLA, wrote a six-page letter to the Prime Minister in February 2006 suggest- ing how the agreement could be used to bolster Canada’s Arctic sovereignty and inviting the Government of Canada to use it for this purpose. Implementing the environmental monitoring provisions (article 12) and establishing the Nunavut Marine Council (article 15) were two suggestions.
Since the nightmare of many Inuit is to see a rusty, convenience- flagged, single-hulled, inadequately crewed oil tanker laboriously navigat- ing the Northwest Passage, full Canadian sovereignty and jurisdic- tion over the waters of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago and full imple- mentation of the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement would go a long way to reassuring Inuit that the most stringent environmental and safety procedures will be applied to shipping in the Northwest Passage, which is projected to significantly increase in years ahead.
Arguably, implementing the agreement in total, particularly its voluminous environmental and resource man- agement provisions, and using it to ”œencourage self-reliance and the cultural and social well-being of Inuit” as speci- fied in the preamble would illustrate to all that Nunavut and the Inuit of Nunavut are part and parcel of Canada, and give substance and on-the-ground meaning to Joe Clark’s stirring words on the floor of the House of Commons in the aftermath of the Polar Sea incident.
The Prime Minister did not reply, and the obvious sovereignty- supporting provisions of the agreement remain unimplemented. All Aboriginal peoples with modern treaties report that the Government of Canada fails to carry out various treaty obligations. Evaluations by the Auditor General of Canada into implementation of the Gwich’in, Nunavut and Inuvialuit comprehensive land claims agreements support this contention. In 2003 all modern treaty organizations represent- ing Aboriginal peoples in northern British Columbia, Yukon, Northwest Territories, Nunavut, northern Quebec and Labrador formed a coalition to per- suade the Government of Canada to adopt a policy to live up to its modern treaty obligations.
With implementation problems mounting, NTI took the unprecedent- ed step in December 2006 of launching a court case to force the Government of Canada to live up to its many responsi- bilities in the NCLA. While the grounds of complaint in the statement of claim are many and varied (see www.tunngavik.com), they include articles that, if implemented, would effectively support Canada’s con- tention that the waters of the Arctic Archipelago are internal to Canada.
We seem now to be in a bizarre sit- uation. NTI is in court attempting to force the Government of Canada to implement the NCLA, including arti- cles that support Canada’s Arctic sover- eignty ”” a political priority of the Prime Minister and his government ”” yet the Crown’s statement of defence denies NTI’s statement of claim and effectively ignores or perhaps even for- feits the opportunity to use the agree- ment for sovereignty support purposes. What does this situation look like to diplomats in the US Department of State or the European Union who continue to question Canada’s Arctic sovereignty?
Prime Minister Harper deserves applause for his attention to the Arctic and focus on sovereignty. While past legal pronouncements and cur- rent plans to deploy the military in the Arctic should be part of Canada’s Arctic sovereignty strategy, they should not be the whole strategy. What else should we do? Don McRae of the University of Ottawa, a member of the UN’s International Law
Commission, suggests Canada should:
uphold its position that the waters of the Northwest Passage are the internal waters of Canada by defending any legal challenge and seizing opportunities to negotiate acceptance of our position if there is a reasonable chance of success;
act seriously and be seen to be taking seriously our claim that the waters of the Arctic Archipel- ago are the internal waters of Canada; and
work internationally to ensure that internationally accepted standards and regulations for shipping and environmental management conform to what Canada regards as desirable for the regulation of Arctic waters.
Nobody suggests that the object of Canada’s Arctic sovereignty should be to wall off the region and prevent or exclude access by others. Rather, the opposite is the case. We should encourage and welcome others into our portion of the Arctic and ensure that they acknowledge and operate under Canadian rules and regulations. So, within the context of McRae’s gen- eral advice, I add the following specif- ic recommendations to the Government of Canada:
Effectively engage the region’s Inuit with a view to jointly ensuring that the obligations, duties and objec- tives of the Nunavut, Inuvialuit, Nunavik and Nunatsiavut land claims agreements are fulfilled;
Work with the Government of Nunavut to devolve to it authority to manage and regulate use of internal waters;
Expand and renew the 2000 Northern Dimension of Canada’s Foreign Policy initiative as a platform from which to engage the United States, Russia, Norway and Denmark/ Greenland in the circumpolar Arctic with a view to promoting a long-term, legally binding Arctic environmental management agreement for the period following resolution through UNCLOS of seabed claims by Arctic Ocean rim states;
Draw a lesson from the Norwegians who have constructed research facilities on the Svalbard Islands, used by researchers from many countries, to bolster and express their Arctic sovereignty; and carry through with the commitment in the Speech from the Throne to construct a world-class research station in the Arctic open to researchers from around the globe as a legacy of the current International Polar Year; and
Incorporate the above points in the Integrated Northern Strategy prom- ised in the Speech from the Throne.
There is little doubt that the circumpolar Arctic is on the cusp of very significant economic, social and environmental change. In response, and in partnership with Inuit, other northerners and their governments, the Government of Canada should seek global acceptance of Canada’s Arctic sovereignty, significant national rights in the offshore northward of our exclusive economic zone and a legally binding treaty between Arctic states to protect this fragile and vulnerable region by ensuring that principles of environmental and social sustainability lie at the heart of future industrial development.
As change unfolds in this no-longer-peripheral region, let us remem- ber that Canada claims sovereignty over a significant portion of the Arctic for a national purpose. It is time to jettison our treatment of the Arctic as a boutique, ”œadd-on” issue and to bring Arctic considerations into the heart of our domestic and foreign policy. . Who would have predicted as recently as 12 months ago that Arctic sovereignty would be the lead theme in the recent Speech from the Throne? But perhaps we should not be too surprised.

Work with the Government of Nunavut to devolve to it authority to manage and regulate use of internal waters;
Expand and renew the 2000 Northern Dimension of Canada’s Foreign Policy initiative as a platform from which to engage the United States, Russia, Norway and Denmark/ Greenland in the circumpolar Arctic with a view to promoting a long-term, legally binding Arctic environmental management agreement for the period following resolution through UNCLOS of seabed claims by Arctic Ocean rim states;
Draw a lesson from the Norwegians who have constructed research facilities on the Svalbard Islands, used by researchers from many countries, to bolster and express their Arctic sovereignty; and carry through with the commitment in the Speech from the Throne to construct a world-class research station in the Arctic open to researchers from around the globe as a legacy of the current International Polar Year; and
Incorporate the above points in the Integrated Northern Strategy prom- ised in the Speech from the Throne.
There is little doubt that the circumpolar Arctic is on the cusp of very significant economic, social and environmental change. In response, and in partnership with Inuit, other northerners and their governments, the Government of Canada should seek global acceptance of Canada’s Arctic sovereignty, significant national rights in the offshore northward of our exclusive economic zone and a legally binding treaty between Arctic states to protect this fragile and vulnerable region by ensuring that principles of environmental and social sustainability lie at the heart of future industrial development.
As change unfolds in this no-longer-peripheral region, let us remem- ber that Canada claims sovereignty over a significant portion of the Arctic for a national purpose. It is time to jettison our treatment of the Arctic as a boutique, ”œadd-on” issue and to bring Arctic considerations into the heart of our domestic and foreign policy. . The Nunavut Land Claims Agreement (the Nunavut Agreement or NLCA) signed in 1993 provided the Inuit of Nunavut with a comprehensive compensation package of cash, lands and powers and, most importantly, the opportunity to control their own jurisdiction and their own public government in the Canadian federation. It is the realization of this later commitment, with the establishment of the Nunavut Territory on April 1, 1999, that we are celebrating this year.
Unfortunately, 10 years on and roughly $10 billion later, Nunavut is still the most financially dependent and underserviced jurisdiction in the country and is still experiencing severe social problems. On its 10th anniversary, it is opportune to ask why Nunavut has not been able to address these problems or create the conditions necessary to free itself from complete financial dependence on the federal government.
The answer to this question is not simple. Obviously, the challenges were overwhelming and 10 years is a very short period to meet them. But I would argue that a key part of the problem lays in the parallel public/Inuit governance structure created under the Nunavut Agreement. Essentially, there is a mismatch between responsibilities and capacity: the government is responsible for the delivery of public services such as health, education and employment but has few resources of its own and little power to carry on its duties. On the other hand, the land claims organization — Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated (NTI) — was given ownership of all of the cash, lands, resource royalties and powers provided in the NLCA, but no responsibility in providing services to the people of the territory.
The story of how Nunavut came to have such a structure of governance is recounted elsewhere in this issue. Here I wish to discuss its impact on the Nunavut government. As I will explain, this de facto parallel system of governance keeps the Nunavut government wholly dependent on the federal government to finance even its basic operations. The degree to which Nunavut’s citizens can enjoy a quality of life on par with all Canadians will ultimately depend on the willingness of NTI to support the public government.
The self-sufficiency and prosperity of any society depends largely on the financial resources available to its government to provide public programs and services, to generate economic activity and to create employment. In Canada, all governments seek financial independence because of the greater control it affords them to provide culturally or regionally appropriate services to their citizens. The development of natural resources is one of the key means by which provinces and territories achieve economic independence. A fundamental attribute of all Canadian provinces is the ownership of lands and resources, and resulting royalties within their borders. For instance, under its terms of union Newfoundland received the right to all lands, mines, minerals and resulting royalties. Furthermore, in 2005, it received the right to be the principal beneficiary of the oil and gas resources off its shores, without any penalty to its equalization payments. It was through this right that the Newfoundland and Labrador government was able to lift itself out of economic dependency.
Nunavut also has significant valuable natural resources. In fact it is blessed with some of the world’s most abundant sources of energy and mineral resources. An estimated 10 percent of Canada’s total oil reserves, 20 percent of its natural gas reserves and significant deposits of uranium, diamonds, gold and iron ore are contained within Nunavut’s borders.
In 1993, the NLCA divided the ownership of these resources between NTI and the Government of Canada. The agreement transferred to NTI the right to mines, minerals and royalties on 18 percent (356,000 square kilometres) of the territory, while Canada retained the remainder (minus the communities, which are territorial responsibility). In addition, the Nunavut Agreement ensures that Canada pays resource royalties to NTI equivalent to 50 percent of the first $2 million of resource royalties earned annually and 5 percent of the rest.
In comparison, the Nunavut government owns no lands outside of its municipalities’ borders, receives no royalties from the development of its natural resources, and has no means of its own to fund its public services. Consequently, the Nunavut government has remained almost wholly dependent on federal transfers. It receives approximately $1.145 billion annually in transfer payments and targeted funding programs, representing a full 90 percent of its total budget.
In other words, the Nunavut Agreement effectively gave NTI one of the most important means through which the Nunavut government could ever hope to become financially independent from the federal government: resource development and resource royalties.
The Nunavut government owns no lands outside of its municipalities’ borders, receives no royalties from the development of its natural resources and has little means of its own to fund its public services. Consequently, the Nunavut government has remained almost wholly dependent on federal transfers.
Moreover, while the Nunavut government received the relatively small sum of $150 million as initial start-up funding, almost 12 times that amount was actually provided to Inuit under the terms of the Nunavut Agreement. Between 1993 and 2007, Canada transferred $1.173 billion in compensation to the Nunavut Trust controlled by NTI and three regional Inuit associations (RIA) (Qikiqtaani, Kivalliq, and Kitikmeot).
According to the deed of the Nunavut Trust, the money must be used for the general benefit of Inuit. The three RIAs control the investments made with the trust fund, whereas NTI controls the distribution of income made from those investments. While it is true that modest amounts of the investment income have been distributed as start-up funds for Inuit businesses, scholarships and hunter support programs, the trust has been primarily used to fund the operations of these four corporations and to fund their subsidiary businesses, but none has been used to help fund public services provided by the Nunavut government.
Under the terms of the Nunavut Agreement “no Major Development Project may commence until an IIBA is finalized.” This means that no mine, transportation corridor, hydroelectricity development or any other project can occur on the lands owned by NTI until an IIBA is concluded.
An impact and benefit agreement is a legal contract between a developer and the landowner (in this case, NTI or one of the regional Inuit associations) to provide compensation for the use of their lands. Compensation can include lucrative service contracts for enterprises owned by NTI or the RIAs, training and scholarship funding, housing and recreation facilities or financial compensation. On several occasions, the RIAs have become direct shareholders in the mineral development projects. In fact, while these corporations are not for profit, they fund and own in full or in part several mining, exploration construction and companies, airlines, cruise lines and retail industries.
Every year, agreements for tens of millions of dollars in contracts are concluded between NTI and multinational mining interests such as Areva Resources, Baffinland Iron Mines Corporation and Agnico-Eagle. But it is difficult to ascertain the true value of these Inuit Impact and Benefit Agreements (IIBAs), because the negotiations take place behind closed doors and their content is made confidential by NTI and the RIAs. The Nunavut government and the municipalities, whose citizens and services are most affected by major development projects, have no voice in the negotiations, and the Nunavut government has no influence over the distribution of benefits. Once they are concluded, only the government of Canada has access to the contents of IIBAs, not the Nunavut government or the general public.
If one compares the situation in Nunavut with those in similar jurisdictions, such as the Nunatsiavut land claims agreement in Newfoundland and Labrador, a clearer picture of the potential value of IIBAs emerges. For instance, agreements negotiated between the mining company Inco and the Inuit and Innu of Labrador included funding for a $15-million hospital, at least $1.2 million in recreation and wellness funding, and funding for scholarships and training. The socio-economic conditions in Nunatsiavut and the scale of mineral development are comparable to those in Nunavut. Thus, it seems the benefits that Nunavut could realize from major development are substantial.
Despite pleas from the Nunavut government and its municipalities, NTI and the RIAs have refused to provide any IIBA funding for areas of public government responsibility or allow communities to be involved in the negotiations. In 2006, Leona Aglukkaq (now the federal minister of health, then Nunavut’s minister of health and minister for the Status of Women Council) asked NTI and the RIAs to use IIBA negotiations to help fund women’s shelters. Earlier that year, the municipality of Cambridge Bay asked the NTI and the Regional Inuit Corporation to help fund its fledgling health and wellness programs with money from IIBAs. Similarly, the municipalities of Baker Lake, Kugluktuk and Cambridge Bay have asked to be part of IIBA negotiations in order to provide health and wellness programs with funding from major development projects. All met with no success. As a result, a real sense of injustice is growing among Nunavut’s citizens, whose communities lack basic public health and wellness programs and functioning municipal infrastructure.
The position taken by NTI and the three RIAs is that they are under no obligation to include communities in IIBA negotiations nor to use compensation money to fund services provided by the Nunavut government. In 2006, at a public hearing for a major mine, a panel of NTI and Kitikmeot Inuit Association officials told the municipality of Cambridge Bay that because the land claim stated that IIBAs are for Inuit, they cannot provide funding that “would provide benefits that would go to non-Inuit, even though the majority of those benefits might go to Inuit.”
The problem with such a response is that NTI and the RIAs control the only legal mechanism afforded by the Nunavut Agreement for leveraging benefits to Nunavut’s communities from major development projects. Given that Nunavut continues to suffer suicide rates 40 times higher than the national average, that approximately 50 percent of the population lives in overcrowded housing and that 76 percent of Inuit children do not finish high school, this unwillingness on the part of NTI and the RIAs to help fund community health and wellness programs delivered to a population whom the land claim was meant to benefit is, to say the least, questionable.
The ability to make exclusive decisions about all aspects of natural resource development is a central power enjoyed by provincial governments. It allows them to ensure that the negative social and environmental impacts of development are mitigated and that maximum economic benefits are realized by their communities and their citizens. Under the terms of the Constitution Act 1867, provincial governments are given exclusive powers for the exploration, development, conservation and management of natural resources (this power was also extended to the Yukon Territory in 2002).
Historically, territorial governments have not been given exclusive powers over lands and resources before decades of negotiations.
In comparison, and unlike other territories, Nunavut has an agreement that provides Inuit with decision-making power over the “use, management and conservation of land, water and resources, including the offshore.” However, rather than empowering the Nunavut government, this decision-making power was given to four independent co-management boards, which regulate all aspects of natural resource development in Nunavut.
Comanagement is a system of power-sharing commonly negotiated in Aboriginal land claims settlements to give greater decision-making authority to Aboriginal groups over Crown lands and resources. In theory, comanagement arrangements allow Aboriginal people greater decision-making authority over the lands, waters and resources on which they depend for their livelihood. Most of the major land claims in Canada, such as the Nunavik (Quebec), Nunatsiavut (Labrador), Inuvialuit (NWT) and Gwich’in (NWT), include comanagement arrangements for lands and resources.
In Nunavut, the decision-making power over lands and resources is distributed among four independent comanagement boards: the Nunavut Impact Review Board, Planning Commission, Water Board and Surface Rights Tribunal. The board members of each organization are appointed equally by the federal government, the territorial government and NTI. Each of these boards issues its own authorizations, has its own office, infrastructure, staff and budget, and is funded by the federal government, at $13 million annually.
The intention of the comanagement model is to give greater decisionmaking powers to Aboriginal people over the management of their lands and resources. For an Aboriginal group living in a province or territory and representing a minority of the population, comanagement would, in theory, create a more equitable distribution of control between its land claims organization and a more powerful provincial or territorial government.
The situation in Nunavut is quite different, because there Inuit form the large majority of the population and have majority control over the territorial government. The comanagement system removes decision-making power from the public government and divides it among three interests (federal, territorial and Inuit). In effect, no one group is accountable for resource management decisions or has the power to make exclusive decisions on development. Without these critical decision-making powers, the Nunavut government has little influence over how Nunavut’s natural resources are developed, or what benefits its communities will derive. In practice, Nunavut’s comanagement system results only in a lengthier and costlier process that fails to deliver any added benefits to Nunavut’s citizens.
In fact, Nunavut’s regulatory system has proven wholly unworkable and is a roadblock to the development of Nunavut’s resources. Over the past five years, reports by the auditor general of Canada and the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development have observed the failure of the dozen or more land and resource comanagement boards set up in Nunavut and the Northwest Territories. They also report a lack of accountability, direction and guidance and fundamental technical capacity issues. The mineral industry, the Nunavut government and the government of Canada have all called for a major overhaul of Nunavut’s land and resource management system.
In 2007, the federal government commissioned Montreal-based lawyer Paul Mayer to conduct an inquiry to determine the feasibility of devolving more powers to the Nunavut government. His report concluded that one of the largest roadblocks to further devolution of land and resource powers to the Nunavut government was the regulatory system of comanagement boards, which did not create a climate that encouraged investment. Moreover, the report concluded that the land and resource comanagement boards “do not have the ability to manage the regulatory process,” and that they “have no clear mandate and do not seem to understand where their jurisdiction begins or ends.”
Ultimately, Nunavut’s success as a legitimate equal in the Canadian federation will depend entirely on the support given to the Nunavut government by NTI. All of the powers and resources necessary for Nunavut to prosper have been negotiated for and have been received by Nunavut’s land claims organizations. All that is needed is for Nunavut’s leaders to finish the great nation-building project that they started by empowering their own Nunavut government with the same powers and resources given to every other province in Canada to allow them to provide for their citizens.
To this end, I propose two short-and two long-term solutions for the G future:
- First, NTI and the Nunavut government should negotiate targeted and conditional transfers that would allow the Nunavut government to use for the benefit of Nunavummiut the more than $1 billion held by the Nunavut Trust, as well as additional resource royalties earned from Inuit-owned lands. These conditional transfers would target priority social programs and services for Inuit. Already, NTI produces an annual report on the status of Inuit culture and society and identifies priorities for health care, education, housing and other issues. NTI now has only to provide the Nunavut government with the money to help carry out these initiatives.
- Secondly, the regional Inuit associations and the Nunavut government should negotiate targeted conditional funding transfers to allow the Nunavut government to improve health and wellness programs in the communities most affected by major resource development. Most of these communities already outlined their priorities during the consultation process for major development projects.
- Third, NTI, the federal government, and the Nunavut government should restructure Nunavut’s land and resource management system by eliminating the redundant comanagement boards. Over the past decade this system has proven to be incapable of managing Nunavut’s regulatory process.
- Finally, NTI could provide the Nunavut government with the means to lift itself out of financial dependency and improve services to Nunavut’s citizens by transferring its exclusive powers for the exploration, development, conservation and management of natural resources to the Nunavut government on the 356,000 square kilometres of land transferrred to Inuit by the Nunavut Agreement.
In 2008, NTI launched a $1-billion lawsuit against the Government of Canada for a perceived lack of progress towards realizing the social, cultural and economic objectives of the Nunavut Agreement. In pursuing this course of action, NTI has failed to understand its own role in Nunavut’s lack of progress. For 10 years, NTI has denied the Nunavut government access to the cash, lands and powers that the Nunavut Agreement provided and that could help the Nunavut government respond to the needs of its citizens.
The Inuit of Nunavut have successfully negotiated for the right to sit as legitimate equals in the Canadian federation. No amount of legal redress will make a difference to Nunavut or its citizens if NTI cannot support the government it created. Ultimately, it is up to Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated to decide whether it will use the benefits it won in the Nunavut Agreement to help lift Nunavut out of financial dependency. Only with NTI’s support will the Nunavut government have any chance of providing its citizens with a standard of living that is on a par with that of all Canadians. . On June 10, 1993, the Nunavut Act and the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement Act received royal assent in Parliament. For the Inuit of Nunavut, these two initiatives were inextricably linked. These two acts of Parliament were the culmination of a generational effort by Inuit to reassume control of their destiny as a people through recognition of their Aboriginal land rights, and through political control provided by a new territorial government within their homeland.
For the Government of Canada, on the other hand, Nunavut and the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement (NLCA) have consistently been regarded as separate initiatives. Although the two initiatives converged in Parliament in June 1993, throughout the 15 years of negotiations leading up to that date, and in the 15 years of implementation since that date, the Government of Canada has maintained a compartmentalized approach to dealing with Inuit Aboriginal land rights and the creation and operation of the Nunavut Territory, resulting in a bifurcated relationship between Canada and the Inuit of Nunavut.
To outside observers, it may have appeared that the creation of the Nunavut Territory and the resolution of the Inuit land claim unfolded as part of a coordinated master plan for changing the future of northern Canada. But for those working inside the federal system, the reality was very different. Nunavut and the NLCA were pursued as separate, and at times conflicting, initiatives.
In this article I look at the unfolding of these two initiatives from my perspective as a member of the federal negotiation team on the Nunavut land claim from 1979 to 1993.
The creation of the Nunavut Territory changed the map of Canada and established a new political entity in the Canadian federation. The NLCA represented the largest Aboriginal land claims settlement in Canadian history. It addressed the Aboriginal rights and title of approximately 17,500 nuit living in 27 communities in the central and eastern Northwest Territories (NWT), covering over 2,000,000 square kilometres of land and adjacent marine areas, representing approximately 20 percent of Canada’s landmass.
Negotiated between 1980 and 1993, the NLCA consists of over 40 chapters, which address wildlife management and harvesting rights, land water and environmental management regimes, parks and conservation areas, heritage resources, public sector employment and contracting, and a range of other issues. The agreement vested Inuit with ownership of 350,000 square kilometres of land, including mineral rights to 36,000 square kilometres. It provided for capital transfers to Inuit of $1.14 billion and an ongoing share of royalties from resource development within the settlement area. Article 4 of the NLCA committed Canada to introduce legislation to establish Nunavut.
Despite the significance of Nunavut and the NLCA, the initiatives were entrusted, within the federal government, to separate and relatively small core teams within the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development (DIAND). Throughout the 1980s, both initiatives proceeded with a relatively low political profile, and the Nunavut land claim had a lower priority than claims in Yukon and the western NWT, where there were greater resource development pressures.
For most of the Nunavut land claim negotiations, the core federal negotiating team consisted of four individuals in the native claims section of DIAND (a senior federal negotiator, an assistant negotiator, a claims analyst and an administrative assistant) and a legal adviser assigned by DIAND legal services. At the negotiation table, the federal team was led by a chief federal negotiator appointed by the minister of Indian affairs and northern development from outside the public service. Tom Molloy, a lawyer from Saskatoon, was the chief federal negotiator from 1982 to 1993. The Government of the Northwest Territories (GNWT) participated in negotiations as part of the federal negotiating team and was usually represented at the table by a senior negotiator and legal counsel. Fortunately, there was a high degree of continuity in the federal team during the negotiation process.
The core federal negotiating team was supported by a federal caucus, which included representatives from government departments affected by the negotiations. While most caucus members worked positively to advance negotiations, they often had limited flexibility or authority to endorse proposals for change. They were generally middle managers who were expected by their departmental senior management to protect departmental interests. Caucus representatives frequently attended the negotiations to provide technical information or as observers. For members of the core federal negotiating team, it often felt as if their caucus “supporters” were there primarily to ensure that the federal negotiators defended departmental interests and that they did not exceed caucus-approved federal positions.
Some of the most difficult debates occurred within DIAND itself between the land claims negotiation team and Northern Program. Northern Program was responsible for federal land and resource management activities in the NWT. It was also responsible for the political development process in the territories. Inuit proposals to turn over much of Northern Program’s authority over and management of lands and resources to Nunavut-based comanagement boards with guaranteed Inuit membership were seen as creating regulatory complexity and undermining the federal government’s ability to manage northern resources. On many occasions, Northern Program suggested that negotiations on these issues be deferred pending a decision on the creation of Nunavut — the premise being that with Nunavut there would be no need to negotiate co-management boards, as Inuit could gain control of lands and resources through eventual devolution to a Nunavut territorial government.
For the Government of Canada, on the other hand, Nunavut and the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement (NLCA) have consistently been regarded as separate initiatives. Although the two initiatives converged in Parliament in June 1993, throughout the 15 years of negotiations leading up to that date, and in the 15 years of implementation since that date, the Government of Canada has maintained a compartmentalized approach to dealing with Inuit Aboriginal land rights and the creation and operation of the Nunavut Territory, resulting in a bifurcated relationship between Canada and the Inuit of Nunavut.
Had commitments to Nunavut been made early in the negotiation process, it is possible that the NLCA might have been more streamlined. Guarantees with respect to land and water management boards might have been less detailed. Issues relating to municipal lands, public sector employment and contracting might have been addressed through Nunavut rather than at the land claims table.
However, self-preservation dictated that the federal land claims team remain firmly agnostic on the creation of Nunavut. If we suggested that the claim could not be settled without Nunavut or if we invited dialogue on how the claims package might be different with Nunavut, we ran the risk of being put on hold pending the outcome of the political development process. Our only option was to keep our heads down and soldier on with the land claim agreement in hopes that it could be approved without Nunavut, or that it would ultimately trigger a decision on Nunavut.
The Inuit also functioned with a relatively small core negotiation team led by a succession of capable Inuit chief negotiators and regional negotiators, supported by a small but dedicated and relatively consistent group of non-Inuit advisers. Given the small size of the negotiation teams, negotiations were centralized at a main table. There was limited capacity to accelerate negotiations through working groups or side tables. While some topics were contentious, the atmosphere was generally respectful and businesslike, with both sides strongly committed to achieving an agreement.
The 1970s saw the intersection of two major issues in the Northwest Territories: the federal commitment to negotiate outstanding Aboriginal land claims pursuant to its 1973 comprehensive land claims policy, and initiatives to divide the territory and restructure the territorial government. In February 1976, the Inuit Tapirisat of Canada (ITC) made a presentation to the federal cabinet on addressing Inuit Aboriginal claims in the NWT, including the creation of a separate Nunavut territory as integral to the settlement of the Inuit land claim. The ITC proposed a tree-line boundary between western NWT and eastern NWT, with Nunavut including the Mackenzie Delta-Beaufort Sea region occupied by the Inuvialuit. A revised Inuit claims proposal presented in December 1977 retained the concept of a new territory. In the same period, the Dene and Métis of the western NWT submitted their land claims and also made proposals to divide and restructure the government of the NWT.
For the federal government, the division of the NWT and the structure of territorial government were a public government issue affecting all NWT residents, not an Aboriginal rights issue. Canada was not prepared to negotiate Nunavut at a land claims table. Land claims negotiations in 1978 and 1979 made virtually no progress due to the impasse on addressing Nunavut.
In the spring of 1980, the ITC and Canada agreed to resume negotiations on the Nunavut land claim on the understanding that the Inuit proposal for the creation of the Nunavut Territory would be dealt with through a political development process in the NWT, separate from, but parallel with, the land claim negotiations. When negotiations began on the land claim in 1980, there was no framework agreement with Inuit setting out the elements and scope of a potential claim settlement; there was no formal federal interdepartmental mandating process; and there was no contemplation of how the creation of a Nunavut territory might affect the shape and content of a land claim agreement. For Inuit, both the land claim track and the political development track were directed at moving the levers of political control from Ottawa and Yellowknife to Nunavut.
Land claim negotiations began with a focus on wildlife management and harvesting rights. Inuit wanted wildlife management decisions to be depoliticized and turned over to an independent regulatory board jointly appointed by Inuit and government. Federal and territorial departments responsible for wildlife and fisheries management were reluctant to move beyond the establishment of advisory boards that would leave final decision-making power and political accountability in the hands of ministers. By the fall of 1981, the negotiation teams had developed a potential compromise, which provided for a joint wildlife management board that would have decision-making powers over harvest regulations and quotas but would be subject to a ministerial power to disallow or override decisions based on conservation and certain other considerations. On that basis, a wildlife subagreement was initialled by the chief negotiators, subject to review by the parties. The federal fisheries and environment ministers refused to endorse the agreement and it remained in suspension until 1986, when the approach was finally accepted, with certain modifications.
In 1982, negotiations witnessed a significant slowdown. The Inuit undertook an internal reorganization, transferring responsibility for negotiations from the ITC, the national Inuit organization, to the Tungavuk Federation of Nunavut (TFN), a regional organization established specifically to represent the Inuit of Nunavut. On the federal side, Tom Molloy was appointed as the new chief federal negotiator. With the cloud of the unresolved wildlife agreement hanging over the parties, it took considerable time to reestablish trust and productive working relationships at the negotiation table.
Of equal significance, the 1986 comprehensive claims policy also brought major structural changes to comprehensive claims negotiations through a new federal mandating process. Through section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982 and an amendment in 1983, comprehensive land claims agreements acquired the status of constitutionally protected treaties. The constitutional status of agreements required increased political oversight and control of negotiations.
By 1985, the negotiation teams had regained momentum and had initialled subagreements on 17 chapters, approximately half of a potential agreement in principle (AIP). However, the negotiations were facing a number of policy impediments. The federal government’s comprehensive claims policy did not permit negotiation of Aboriginal rights in the offshore, or royalty sharing from mineral and oil and gas development. And there was continuing deadlock over whether land and water and environmental management boards would have advisory or decision-making roles.
With the constitutional recognition of Aboriginal and treaty rights in section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982, the Government of Canada was facing increasing demands across the country for changes to its comprehensive claims policy and, in particular, to requirements for surrender or extinguishment of Aboriginal rights. In 1985, the federal government established a task force to conduct national consultations and to recommend revisions to its claims policy. In late 1986, the federal cabinet approved a revised comprehensive claims policy, which included a number of changes favourable to the Inuit negotiations.
Of equal significance, the 1986 comprehensive claims policy also brought major structural changes to comprehensive claims negotiations through a new federal mandating process. Through section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982 and an amendment in 1983, comprehensive land claims agreements acquired the status of constitutionally protected treaties. The constitutional status of agreements required increased political oversight and control of negotiations. The 1986 policy established a requirement that all negotiations have a cabinet-approved mandate for all elements of a potential settlement package. The policy also provided for the establishment of a federal steering committee of assistant deputy ministers that was authorized to provide more specific direction for negotiations within the broad mandates approved by cabinet. This provided a forum in which to resolve disagreements that had previously festered unresolved between DIAND and other departments.
Consistent with the new comprehensive claims policy, the federal negotiating team on the Nunavut land claim was required to seek a cabinet mandate on an overall land claim settlement package before returning to the negotiation table. Discussions with TFN in mid-1987 reached consensus on the remaining list of matters for negotiation. The federal team then sought cabinet approval of the subagreements already negotiated and a mandate to address all of the remaining issues. The mandate was approved in November 1987. Reflecting the changes in the claims policy, it empowered federal negotiators to address offshore rights, royalty sharing and decision-making powers for land and water management boards. Notably, the mandate maintained a total separation between the land claim agreement and Nunavut.
With the federal mandate in place, negotiations resumed with greater intensity and focus. By the fall of 1989, negotiations were narrowing down to a limited list of issues that would go for resolution at a meeting between Inuit leaders, the minister of Indian affairs and northern development and the GNWT. The two key outstanding issues were the financial component of the land claims agreement and Nunavut.
Throughout the 1980s, the federal land claims negotiation team monitored the on-again, off-again progress on the political development front, but maintained a total separation between the initiatives.
In 1982, a plebiscite was held in the Northwest Territories to test public support for division. A small majority of participating voters endorsed the concept. The Constitutional Alliance was established, composed of members of the NWT Legislative Assembly and representatives of Aboriginal organizations, to pursue the initiative. It established two subgroups, the Western Constitutional Forum and the Nunavut Constitutional Forum. In 1987, they negotiated the Iqaluit Agreement, which proposed that the boundary for division be based on the boundary between the Inuit land claim and the Dene-Métis and Inuvialuit land claims, and that the boundary be approved by a plebiscite. However, the Inuit and the Dene-Métis failed to reach agreement on a boundary between their claims. As a result, the agreement was not implemented and the two constitutional forums and the Constitutional Alliance were disbanded.
In mid-1989, with the land claim AIP nearing completion, the separate but parallel tracks of the Nunavut land claim negotiations and the Nunavut Territory began to converge. It was becoming clear that the success of any meeting between the minister and Inuit leaders to finalize an AIP on the land claim would hinge on a commitment with respect to the creation of Nunavut. It was not possible in the time available to galvanize the federal system or the territorial government to make firm commitments to the creation of Nunavut. However, it was recognized that, at a minimum, Inuit needed assurance that the fate of Nunavut would be determined one way or the other before a ratification vote on a final Nunavut land claim agreement.
On the night of December 7, 1989, a meeting was held on Parliament Hill between Inuit leaders, the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development and the GNWT to conclude the final issues on the Nunavut land claim AIP. In preparation for the meeting, the Minister had written to the territorial government seeking support to establish a process and timetable for achieving a decision on Nunavut. At the meeting, the GNWT and TFN reached agreement to develop, within six months of the AIP, a process for the creation of Nunavut outside the land claim agreement, consistent with the 1987 Iqaluit Agreement, including a requirement for a territory-wide plebiscite on the boundary. The commitment was set out in article 4 of the land claim AIP, confirming the support in principle of the three parties for the creation of the Nunavut Territory as soon as possible. With article 4 in place, agreement was reached on the remaining claim issues.
The Nunavut land claim AIP was signed in Igloolik on April 30, 1990. For the first time, the Nunavut land claim agreement and Nunavut acquired a significant political profile in the federal system, with Minister Thomas Siddon and Inuit leaders forging a working relationship to advance the agenda.
The parties announced a target of 18 months to achieve a final agreement, with a view to securing ratification by Parliament before the next federal election, projected for the fall of 1992. With that target, final negotiations on the land claim and the political development process embarked on a demanding “beat the clock” agenda with essentially no room for delays or setbacks.
Within the federal system, the assistant deputy minister of Northern Program, Richard Van Loon, and the director general of constitutional development in Northern Program, Jack Stagg, performed a strategic oversight and coordination role. But at an operational level, the land claim negotiations and the political development process continued on separate tracks. Given the timelines and work pressures, there was virtually no contact between the federal land claim team and the federal team in Northern Program working on the Nunavut process.
At the land claims table, energies focused on a daunting regional land identification process involving all 27 Inuit communities. Equally pressing was the need to address overlapping claims between the Inuit and other Aboriginal groups, including the determination of the boundary between Inuit and Dene-Métis claims in the NWT.
A boundary was essential, for both the land claim agreement and the political development process. Following a fact-finding exercise demonstrating continued disagreement between Inuit and Dene, the federal government asked John Parker, a former commissioner of the NWT, to recommend a single line boundary between the two claims areas. Despite severe discontent with portions of the “Parker line,” Inuit leaders reluctantly accepted the boundaryinJuly1991, subject to a number of concessions at the land claims table on land quantum and ownership rights. The urgent need for a boundary line for the Nunavut process and boundary plebiscite was the deciding factor for the Inuit leaders. Had Nunavut not been in the equation, the boundary issue could have caused the land claim to founder or fragment into three regional Inuit claims.
By December 1991, the final agreement on the land claim was essentially completed, pending another decisive meeting on final issues between the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Inuit leaders and the GNWT. Once again, the pivotal issue for that meeting was Nunavut. At a late-night meeting on Parliament Hill in mid-December, negotiations were finalized on the outstanding issues on the Nunavut land claim, including agreement on a new article 4 on political development.
The new article 4 committed the Government of Canada to recommend legislation to Parliament to establish the Nunavut Territory. It provided that Canada, the GNWT and TFN would negotiate a political accord addressing the powers and financial arrangements for the Nunavut government and the timing for its creation. The accord was to be completed by April 1992, prior to the Inuit ratification vote on their land claim agreement.
While cabinet had been briefed on the status of work on Nunavut, Minister Brian Siddon entered the meeting without cabinet authorization to commit the federal government to its creation. However, it was clear at the meeting that statements of support in principle would not carry the day and the time had come for a decision. Following the meeting, Minister Siddon called Prime Minister Brian Mulroney to advise him of developments. The next day, at a hastily organized press conference, Minister Siddon, flanked by Inuit leaders, announced the conclusion of the land claim agreement and the federal government’s commitment to the creation of Nunavut.
The Government of Nunavut finds itself in the middle of a bilateral treaty relationship between the Inuit and Canada, where it has major implementation responsibilities, but where it is not recognized as a full partner and where it does not feel adequately resourced to fulfill its treaty obligations or the expectations of Inuit.
The Nunavut Political Accord was initialled by negotiators for the three parties on April 27, 1992, the boundary for division was approved in a territorial plebiscite on May 4, 1992, and the Political Accord was signed in Iqaluit on October 30, 1992. Following a two-month ratification tour by Inuit and federal negotiators to all Inuit communities, the Inuit ratification vote on the land claim agreement was held from November 3 to November 5, 1992. The land claim agreement was endorsed by 85 percent of those who voted. During the course of the ratification tour, it was evident that the successful ratification vote was highly dependent on the commitment to create Nunavut.
The NLCA was signed in Iqaluit on May 25, 1993 by Prime Minister Mulroney, Paul Quassa of TFN, and Nellie Cournoyea, government leader of the GNWT, and other representatives of the parties. The Bill to ratify the NLCA and Bill to create Nunavut received first reading in Parliament on May 28, 1993, and received royal assent on June 10, 1993. These two major initiatives, which would transform the future of northern Canada, proceeded through Parliament essentially without discussion or debate, just “beating the clock” prior to the calling of the 1993 federal election.
The statements of all parties at the signing of the NLCA in May 1993 described the NLCA and the creation of Nunavut as an accomplishment in nation building and heralded the combined initiatives as the beginning of “a new partnership” between Canada and the Inuit of Nunavut. However, following royal assent, implementation of the NLCA and the creation of the Nunavut Territory again reverted to separate tracks.
Since 1993 the treaty relationship between Canada and the Inuit of Nunavut has attenuated into a technical, activity-based implementation process to fulfill specific obligations set out in a joint implementation plan. The Nunavut Tunngavik Inc. (NTI), the Inuit organization responsible for overseeing implementation of the land claim agreement, is calling for a more purposive approach to implementation and increased implementation funding to achieve the environmental, social and economic objectives of the NLCA. Federal officials have expressed concerns that NTI is conflating treaty rights and obligations with broader socio-economic and cultural objectives that go beyond treaty implementation. The Government of Nunavut finds itself in the middle of a bilateral treaty relationship between the Inuit and Canada, where it has major implementation responsibilities, but where it is not recognized as a full partner and where it does not feel adequately resourced to fulfill its treaty obligations or the expectations of Inuit.
After 1993, NTI continued to have a political role in the transition process for the creation of the Nunavut Territory, which came into being on April 1, 1999. However, once the Nunavut government was in place, federal-territorial relations assumed a bilateral format between the Government of Nunavut and the Government of Canada, with no role for NTI.
While Nunavut is characterized as an expression of Inuit self-government through public government, neither the creation of Nunavut nor the NLCA affected the Inuit inherent right of self-government. Nunavut may yet require further structural arrangements to institutionalize its role as an expression of Inuit self-government, including a more formal role for NTI as the guardian of Inuit Aboriginal and treaty rights.
This would require further clarification and separation of NTI’s quasigovernmental roles from the business and corporate roles of NTI and the other Inuit land claim corporate entities that control nearly 20 percent of the Nunavut land base and almost one-third of its high-potential mineral lands.
Nunavut and the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement represent historic achievements, providing Inuit with economic opportunities and political levers to improve their socio-economic circumstances. Both have made major contributions to that objective and hold the potential to do much more. However, the difference between Canada’s compartmentalized approach to Nunavut and the Nunavut Land Claim Agreement and the more holistic view of the Inuit remains an underlying source of tension in the ongoing relationship between Canada and the Inuit of Nunavut.
There is currently no forum where the three parties in the “new partnership” between Canada and the Inuit of Nunavut (the Government of Canada, NTI and the Government of Nunavut) can transcend the traditional boundaries of treaty rights and federal-territorial relations to bring together their collective resources to address the challenges facing the Inuit of Nunavut. To unlock the full promise and potential synergies of Nunavut and the NLCA, there is a need for a dialogue on the future relationship between these two initiatives. . Who would have predicted as recently as 12 months ago that Arctic sovereignty would be the lead theme in the recent Speech from the Throne? But perhaps we should not be too surprised.
Following the last federal election campaign Prime Minister designate Stephen Harper pounced on comments by David Wilkins, the US ambassador to Canada, reaffirming Washington’s long-standing view that the Northwest Passage is an international strait through which international ship- ping has the right of passage. Harper admonished the ambas- sador and the United States for failing to recognize Canada’s Arctic sovereignty, saying: ”œWe have significant plans for national defence and for defence of our sovereignty, includ- ing Arctic sovereignty…It is the Canadian people we get our mandate from, not the ambassador from the United States.”
Prime Minister Harper toured the three territories in summer 2006 and again in summer 2007, delivering policy speeches in which Arctic sovereignty featured prominently. Deploying newly promised ice-strengthened navy patrol boats operating out of a yet-to-be-constructed deepwater port at Arctic Bay to assert sovereignty was a natural fit for a government that came to power with a mandate to rebuild and reinvest in the military.
It seems ironic, however, that current efforts to assert Arctic sovereignty are driven by melting sea ice opening the Northwest Passage. Until very recently, the Prime Minister was in the camp of the climate change deniers. His government has yet to bring forward a policy on adaptation to the unavoidable impacts of climate change. Nor does the Government of Canada yet appreciate the opportunity to use the 1993 Nunavut Land Claims Agreement (NLCA) ”” the only modern treaty to specifically mention Arctic sovereignty ”” to bolster Canada’s Arctic sovereignty.
Canada has a tradition of asserting Arctic sovereignty primarily in reaction to assumed and real challenges: The unwelcome voyages through the Northwest Passage of SS Manhattan in 1969 and 1970, and the US Coast Guard icebreaker Polar Sea in 1985 readily come to mind. Promises made in the heat of sovereignty challenges to build a Polar Class 8 icebreaker and deploy a subsurface surveillance system across the passage from Cornwallis Island to Somerset Island were abandoned as too expensive when the media and public interest moved on to other issues.
In August 2007 two Russian mini- submarines planted a titanium Russian flag on the floor of the Arctic Ocean at the North Pole, symbolically claiming sovereignty over the seabed northward of Russia’s 200-nautical-mile exclusive economic zone. Responding to vivid images on the television, Peter MacKay, then minister of foreign affairs and international trade, dismissed this as ”œjust a show.” Perhaps it was, but when responding he confused two issues: international shipping rights, if any, in the Northwest Passage, and extension by rim states of their continental shelf rights deep in the Arctic Ocean through a process defined in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). His over-the-top characterization of Russia’s action as reminiscent of how states acted in the 15th century was not balanced by an announcement on an alternative Canadian approach.
More embarrassment followed. It was revealed in The Globe and Mail in August 2007 that Canada was relying upon a Russian icebreaker as the platform from which to collect data to support its own Arctic Ocean conti- nental shelf submission. In response, Rob Huebert of the University of Calgary pithily commented, ”œIf you’re building a court case, do you depend on the opposing side for the sources of your argument?”
Jacob Verhoef, the head of Canada’s scientific data collection effort, warned that Canada’s submission, due by 2013, 10 years after Canada ratified UNCLOS, might be lacking. It seemed that Canada was now paying the price for failing to build the Polar Class 8 icebreaker and for delays in starting data collection to sup- port its claim. Had Canada thought ahead when, in the mid-1990s, decisions were taken to ratify UNCLOS at some time in the future? Apparently not.
Generally there has been a warm response in the North as well as nationally to the Prime Minister’s commitment to assert Canada’s Arctic sovereignty, although what’s at stake is poorly understood, and some worry that sovereignty assertion through navy patrol vessels signals the remilitarization of the North.
Numerous commentators have pressed the Government of Canada to modernize and expand Canada’s fleet of icebreakers and to use the coast guard rather than the navy for Arctic sovereignty assertion. But it was the Prime Minister himself who revealed the reasoning as well as the intent of the Government of Canada in July 2007 when he announced the Arctic patrol ships and deepwater port: ”œCanada has a choice when it comes to defending our sovereignty over the Arctic. We either use it or lose it. And make no mistake, this Government intends to use it.”
But this is simply wrong. Far from being a wilderness unoccupied by people, the Arctic is known, named and used by Inuit ”” Canadian citizens ”” and by a small but growing number of arrivals from the south. Inuit trace their use of this region back thousands of years through Thule, Dorset and Pre-Dorset peoples.
Canadian Inuit and Canada’s Arctic sovereignty have invariably been linked. In the 1950s Inuit families from northern Quebec were relocated to Resolute on Cornwallis Island and Grise Fiord on Ellesmere Island. While the reasons for this relocation have been hotly debat- ed, sovereignty assertion is thought by many to be one reason for the move. In 1970 a Canadian Inuit hunter and dog team from Resolute stood boldly in front of SS Manhattan as it plowed through pack ice on its historic voyage ”” it stopped. A point had been made.
The Arctic Waters Pollution Prevention Act ”” Canada’s prime response to the Manhattan incident ”” invoked the need to protect the envi- ronment upon which Inuit depended out to 100 miles from the coast. In 1985 Inuvialuit as well as Canadian national- ists from the south were on board a small plane that buzzed the Polar Sea dropping politically charged notes from the sky politely but firmly reminding the crew of Canada’s Arctic sovereignty. In the aftermath of the Polar Sea inci- dent the late Mark R. Gordon, an Inuit leader from northern Quebec, said Inuit would hold up the Canadian flag in the Arctic. And still today Inuit leaders remain fully supportive of Canada’s Arctic sovereignty. Mary Simon, President of Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, the national Inuit organization, conducted a Canada-wide tour late in 2007 to engage and inform Canadians on Arctic sovereignty and to gain public support for Inuit involvement in this issue.
The geographical extent of Inuit land and resource use in the Arctic has been well known for many years. In 1973 the Government of Canada announced the resumption of modern treaty negoti- ations with Aboriginal peoples whose right to land has not been extinguished by earlier treaties or superseded by law. Inuit of the Northwest Territories were first in line. Before commencing negotia- tions the Government of Canada demanded evidence of the extent, inten- sity and frequency of land and resource use in order to define the area subject to negotiation. This was duly provided in the three-volume report of the Inuit Land Use and Occupancy Project, published in 1977 by the Minister of Supply and Services Canada.
A classic in the field and still fre- quently quoted, this study drew upon interviews with more than 80 percent of Inuit hunters and definitively illustrated use and occupancy by Inuit in the Northwest Territories and a small portion of northern Yukon of 3.8 million square kilometres of land and ocean, used inter- changeably. For Inuit, sea ice is a plat- form used for travel between communities and to favoured hunting sites, often at the floe edge. Separate stud- ies addressed Inuit land use and occupan- cy in northern Quebec and Labrador. The 1977 Inuit Land Use and Occupancy Project demonstrated Inuit use and occu- pancy of Lancaster Sound and Barrow Strait ”” the eastern end of the Northwest Passage ”” the very area characterized by the United States and some European countries as an international strait.
In response to the Polar Sea voyage, Canada drew straight baselines from the outer edge of the coast and fringing islands enclosing the Arctic Archipelago and declared waters within the baselines to be internal waters over which Canada has full rights to regulate and potentially to exclude shipping. The results of the Inuit Land Use and Occupancy Project pro- vided support for this legal move by helping Canada to claim historic title to the area. Lawyers from the Department of Justice knew all about the Inuit Land Use and Occupancy Project. Speaking on the floor of the House of Commons in 1985, Joe Clark, Minister of External Relations, waxed eloquent: ”œCanada’s sovereign- ty in the Arctic is indivisible. It embraces land, sea and ice. It extends without interruption to the seaward facing coasts of the Arctic Islands. These islands are joined and not divided by the waters between them.”
Considerable and ongoing politi- cal support has been provided by Inuit to Canada’s Arctic sovereignty over many years. Many Canadian Inuit leaders are well known and well respected internationally. Their voices carry moral weight that complements efforts by Canadian diplomats to per- suade other countries to our view. Notwithstanding, the Government of Canada has yet to effectively engage Inuit in Arctic sovereignty assertion and by failing to fully implement the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement is forsaking a potential trump card in this complex international game.
Following more than 20 years of negotiation, the Inuit of Nunavut and Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada ratified in 1993 the NCLA ”” a modern treaty within the meaning of section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982. Promises made in this agreement are guaranteed in Canada’s constitution and enforceable in the courts. Through the agreement Inuit ceded, released and sur- rendered to the Crown their Aboriginal title, rights, claims and interests to lands and waters within Canada and received in return a wide range of rights applicable throughout the Nunavut Settlement Area, including wildlife harvesting and repre- sentation on institutions of public government to man- age and regulate the use of land, water, oceans, wildlife and natural resources. The Government of Nunavut was established in 1999 as a result of a promise in the NCLA.
The parties agreed to exchange Aboriginal title for defined rights and ben- efits ”œin recognition of the contributions of Inuit to Canada’s history, identity and sovereignty in the Arctic.” Article 15 dealing with marine areas adds: ”œCanada’s sov- ereignty over the waters of the Arctic Archipelago is supported by Inuit use and occupancy.” Inuit have negotiated four comprehensive land claims agreements covering northern Quebec (1975), the Beaufort Sea region (1984), Nunavut (1993) and northern Labrador (2004). All support Canada’s Arctic sovereignty gener- ally, but only the NCLA explicitly addresses Arctic sovereignty.
Implementation of this agreement is an ongoing expression of a negotiated partnership between the Government of Canada and the Inuit of Nunavut and could be an important component of a strategy to assert, affirm and express Canada’s Arctic sovereignty. But at pres- ent this is not the case.
The President of Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated (NTI), the Inuit organ- ization with the mandate to implement the NCLA, wrote a six-page letter to the Prime Minister in February 2006 suggest- ing how the agreement could be used to bolster Canada’s Arctic sovereignty and inviting the Government of Canada to use it for this purpose. Implementing the environmental monitoring provisions (article 12) and establishing the Nunavut Marine Council (article 15) were two suggestions.
Since the nightmare of many Inuit is to see a rusty, convenience- flagged, single-hulled, inadequately crewed oil tanker laboriously navigat- ing the Northwest Passage, full Canadian sovereignty and jurisdic- tion over the waters of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago and full imple- mentation of the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement would go a long way to reassuring Inuit that the most stringent environmental and safety procedures will be applied to shipping in the Northwest Passage, which is projected to significantly increase in years ahead.
Arguably, implementing the agreement in total, particularly its voluminous environmental and resource man- agement provisions, and using it to ”œencourage self-reliance and the cultural and social well-being of Inuit” as speci- fied in the preamble would illustrate to all that Nunavut and the Inuit of Nunavut are part and parcel of Canada, and give substance and on-the-ground meaning to Joe Clark’s stirring words on the floor of the House of Commons in the aftermath of the Polar Sea incident.
The Prime Minister did not reply, and the obvious sovereignty- supporting provisions of the agreement remain unimplemented. All Aboriginal peoples with modern treaties report that the Government of Canada fails to carry out various treaty obligations. Evaluations by the Auditor General of Canada into implementation of the Gwich’in, Nunavut and Inuvialuit comprehensive land claims agreements support this contention. In 2003 all modern treaty organizations represent- ing Aboriginal peoples in northern British Columbia, Yukon, Northwest Territories, Nunavut, northern Quebec and Labrador formed a coalition to per- suade the Government of Canada to adopt a policy to live up to its modern treaty obligations.
With implementation problems mounting, NTI took the unprecedent- ed step in December 2006 of launching a court case to force the Government of Canada to live up to its many responsi- bilities in the NCLA. While the grounds of complaint in the statement of claim are many and varied (see www.tunngavik.com), they include articles that, if implemented, would effectively support Canada’s con- tention that the waters of the Arctic Archipelago are internal to Canada.
We seem now to be in a bizarre sit- uation. NTI is in court attempting to force the Government of Canada to implement the NCLA, including arti- cles that support Canada’s Arctic sover- eignty ”” a political priority of the Prime Minister and his government ”” yet the Crown’s statement of defence denies NTI’s statement of claim and effectively ignores or perhaps even for- feits the opportunity to use the agree- ment for sovereignty support purposes. What does this situation look like to diplomats in the US Department of State or the European Union who continue to question Canada’s Arctic sovereignty?
Prime Minister Harper deserves applause for his attention to the Arctic and focus on sovereignty. While past legal pronouncements and cur- rent plans to deploy the military in the Arctic should be part of Canada’s Arctic sovereignty strategy, they should not be the whole strategy. What else should we do? Don McRae of the University of Ottawa, a member of the UN’s International Law
Commission, suggests Canada should:
uphold its position that the waters of the Northwest Passage are the internal waters of Canada by defending any legal challenge and seizing opportunities to negotiate acceptance of our position if there is a reasonable chance of success;
act seriously and be seen to be taking seriously our claim that the waters of the Arctic Archipel- ago are the internal waters of Canada; and
work internationally to ensure that internationally accepted standards and regulations for shipping and environmental management conform to what Canada regards as desirable for the regulation of Arctic waters.
Nobody suggests that the object of Canada’s Arctic sovereignty should be to wall off the region and prevent or exclude access by others. Rather, the opposite is the case. We should encourage and welcome others into our portion of the Arctic and ensure that they acknowledge and operate under Canadian rules and regulations. So, within the context of McRae’s gen- eral advice, I add the following specif- ic recommendations to the Government of Canada:
Effectively engage the region’s Inuit with a view to jointly ensuring that the obligations, duties and objec- tives of the Nunavut, Inuvialuit, Nunavik and Nunatsiavut land claims agreements are fulfilled;
Work with the Government of Nunavut to devolve to it authority to manage and regulate use of internal waters;
Expand and renew the 2000 Northern Dimension of Canada’s Foreign Policy initiative as a platform from which to engage the United States, Russia, Norway and Denmark/ Greenland in the circumpolar Arctic with a view to promoting a long-term, legally binding Arctic environmental management agreement for the period following resolution through UNCLOS of seabed claims by Arctic Ocean rim states;
Draw a lesson from the Norwegians who have constructed research facilities on the Svalbard Islands, used by researchers from many countries, to bolster and express their Arctic sovereignty; and carry through with the commitment in the Speech from the Throne to construct a world-class research station in the Arctic open to researchers from around the globe as a legacy of the current International Polar Year; and
Incorporate the above points in the Integrated Northern Strategy prom- ised in the Speech from the Throne.
There is little doubt that the circumpolar Arctic is on the cusp of very significant economic, social and environmental change. In response, and in partnership with Inuit, other northerners and their governments, the Government of Canada should seek global acceptance of Canada’s Arctic sovereignty, significant national rights in the offshore northward of our exclusive economic zone and a legally binding treaty between Arctic states to protect this fragile and vulnerable region by ensuring that principles of environmental and social sustainability lie at the heart of future industrial development.
As change unfolds in this no-longer-peripheral region, let us remem- ber that Canada claims sovereignty over a significant portion of the Arctic for a national purpose. It is time to jettison our treatment of the Arctic as a boutique, ”œadd-on” issue and to bring Arctic considerations into the heart of our domestic and foreign policy. .

Once built, Mary River could triple the territory's annual economic growth rate and provide nearly $5-billion in taxes and royalties to the territory over its 21-year life.
""This is a game-changer for Nunavut and I think it's very exciting to be a witness and part of the process,"" Minister of Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development, John Duncan, said in an interview Monday.
""We are going to end up with northern infrastructure, including a deep-water port, a road and a railway north of 60, which is pretty exciting,"" he said.
Construction on the project could begin as early as next July, and the mine could be in production as soon as 2017.
Mary River is owned and operated by Baffinland Iron Mines Corp., a joint venture between ArcelorMittal and Iron Ore Holdings LP that acquired the project together at a time when iron ore prices were at near-record highs.
Since then, prices for iron ore, the key ingredient in steel-making, have fallen dramatically as demand fell in China, the motor behind global commodities consumption for much of the past decade.
The project is still in the permitting stage, but for now its owners plan to spend some $4-billion to develop Mary River, even as some rivals postpone or cancel major spending plans in the face of the market slump.
""This signals us moving on through the environmental assessment phase and into the regulatory or permitting phase,"" said Gregory Missal, head of corporate affairs at Baffinland.
Late last month, Cliffs Natural Resources said it was temporarily suspending the expansion of its Bloom Lake mine in Canada's Labrador Trough. Brazil's Vale SA, the world's second-largest mining company, cut 2013 capital spending by 24 per cent following a drop in iron ore prices to a three-year low in September, Reuters reported Monday.
And ArcelorMittal is said to be exploring selling a stake in its Canadian iron ore business, valued at some $10-billion (U.S.), although Baffinland is not among the assets that might be sold.
At 18 million tonnes in annual production and with a direct sea route to transport the commodity, Mary River would be capable of supplying all of Europe's needs, potentially displacing dominant iron ore producers like BHP Billiton and Vale SA.
""We believe that Mary River could be one of the best undeveloped iron ore deposits in the world,"" said analyst Matthew Gibson at CIBC World Markets, noting also the high-grade nature of the Mary River deposit and potential for extremely low costs of production.
""I would add that despite Cliff's recently announced pullback in spending in the Labrador Trough, companies such as Wuhan Steel and Tata Steel continue to invest heavily in the region,"" he added, noting a final construction decision has yet to be made by ArcelorMittal on Mary River.
The project, located in mid- to northern Baffin Island, requires the construction of a 149-kilometre railway to a deep-water port that must also be built.
Ottawa approved the project based on the recommendation of the Nunavut Impact Review Board, which includes some 180 conditions that the company must meet to reduce its environmental impact.
However, it will also affect caribou migration, disturb walrus populations, and have an impact on seals, polar bears, beluga whales and other wildlife.
""It's been a long process but I do believe we've achieved a balance,"" Mr. Duncan said. ""And I also view this as a rather benign project as mines go because the ore body requires no processing on site, other than crushing."" . Call them the lakes that shouldn’t be.
Deep beneath a massive glacier in the Canadian Arctic, scientists have discovered a pair of hidden reservoirs that may offer a unique opportunity for testing the possibility that life exists elsewhere in our solar system.
The lakes, which were discovered with the help of ice-penetrating radar, measure eight and five kilometres long and occupy parallel depressions on Nunavut’s Devon Island. They lie beneath the centre of a sprawling, permanent ice cap that covers the eastern end of the island. Scientists estimate the ice cap has kept the lakes sealed off from their surrounding environment for up to 120,000 years.

But what is most surprising about the lakes is how cold they are. Calculations suggest they must be at or near -10.5°C. Only extremely briny water – about 15 per cent salt by weight – can remain liquid at such a low temperature. This offers the prospect of two dark, cold, hypersaline bodies of water that may be the closest thing Earth has to what exist under the ice caps of Mars or the hidden ocean of Jupiter’s moon Europa.
“They might be a unique ecosystem that could support microbial life,” said Anja Rutishauser, a PhD student at the the University of Alberta, who made the discovery. “This might help us better understand the possibilities and limitations of life in such extreme environments on Earth, but also beyond Earth.”
Ms. Rutishauser spotted the lakes last year while examining radar cross-sections through the Devon ice cap obtained from NASA and other U.S. collaborators. They appeared then as two flat-bottomed troughs, dubbed T1 and T2, with highly reflective surfaces that are typical of bodies of water hidden by ice.
“I wasn’t looking for lakes. We didn’t think there was liquid water there at all,” she said.
Ms. Rutishauser and colleagues later worked out that a geological layer with salt-bearing minerals discovered elsewhere on Devon Island is likely to break the surface at the point where the lakes are situated. Contact between the salt and the bottom of the ice cap may thus have produced a briny slush or perhaps stretches of more open salt water under an icy lid.
The radar data do not show how deep the lakes may be or what volume of water they contain.
The find, reported Wednesday in the journal Science Advances, marks the first time that subglacial lakes have been detected in Canada. The unusual properties of the lakes appear to make them unlike any in the world.
While there are known to be about 400 lakes under the Antarctic ice sheet and a handful more in Greenland, they are freshwater bodies kept fluid by pressure or fed by meltwater from above. None are thought to be as cold or as salty as the lakes on Devon Island.
“This is big. We’ve got a little jewel here now that’s going to attract a lot of attention in terms of planetary science,” said Lyle Whyte, a microbiologist at McGill University in Montreal who specializes in life under extreme conditions and was not involved in the discovery.
Dr. Whyte added that getting through the 740-metre thick ice cap to sample whether anything is living in the lakes there would be “a major undertaking,” but one that many scientists would be keen to try.
Life in the lakes would have to contend with the absence of sunlight and a severe shortage of organic carbon, Dr. Whyte said. Any microbes surviving there would be forced to derive their energy from chemical reactions rather than photosynthesis.
“The bugs would have to be eating rocks,” he said.
Bacteria have been discovered doing similar things deep in the Earth and in other extreme locations such as hot springs and deep sea vents. But no one has examined an environment quite like the one the Devon Island lakes may present, which would likely have several factors in common with watery locales elsewhere in the solar system.
Mark Skidmore, a geologist at Montana State University who was a collaborator on the find, has previously been involved in sampling subglacial lakes under the Antarctic ice sheet using hot water drills. The low temperature at the base of the Devon Island glacier would likely require a modified version of the technology, he said.
“One potential solution would be to use a highly saline solution as the drilling fluid, so that it would not freeze in the borehole during the drilling process,” he said.
Dr. Skidmore added that measures could be taken to avoid contaminating the lakes with bacteria from the surface.
Laying the groundwork for such an effort would be a multiyear undertaking.
Ms. Rutishauser said the next step will come in May, when she and others will head to Devon Island to gather more radar data and better characterize the lakes.
As for what the lakes should be called, “We have not thought about naming these lakes, and I am not sure who would get to name them,” Ms. Rutishauser said. “To me, it would make sense to give them an Inuit name.” .

Few people have a better window on Nunavut's youth than John Fanjoy, and few people are so irrepressibly optimistic about the territory's future.
Despite the social concerns that permeate much of his job as vice-principal of the 300-student Aqsarniit Middle School, he insists he works with the world's best kids in the world's best place.
""We have students who have some major issues. We have students who struggle in literacy. But our students, for the most part, are respectful, willing to learn and, above all, love living in Nunavut,"" he said. ""Many of them are pulled in many directions culturally, depending on whether they're at school or at home, but they come here and work hard.""
That resilience in the face of perplexing cultural demands is reflected in the essays here. Heading into their teen years, students at Aqsarniit carry some very grown-up concerns about life in Canada's newest territory: food prices, truancy, over-hunting, global warming, cultural erosion.
""The biggest issue we face is these social problems being brought into the school,"" Mr. Fanjoy said. ""We have students who don't eat enough, students who have substance abuse at home. We try to do a lot to make the school as warm and welcoming a place as possible.""
Mr. Fanjoy realizes he's always working against a historical image problem. Decades of abuse at residential schools created a widespread distrust in public education across the North. A chronic shortage of Inuktitut-speaking teachers and a lack of outdoor education only compound the cultural wariness. Across the territory, just one in four Inuit students finishes high school.
But the kids who stick with it receive an education on par with any school system in the country, according to Mr. Fanjoy. ""We don't have a graduation issue, we have an attendance issue,"" he said. ""People have to realize the idea of daily education is a very new concept in Nunavut. What was the graduation rate of Ontario in, say, 1885? It's an evolving process. There are students here now who are going to push Nunavut onto great things.""
WHAT NUNAVUT'S YOUTH HAD TO SAY
We asked students at Aqsarniit Middle School to tell the rest of the country about their lives in Nunavut's capital. Here are seven of their written responses.
ROSALINA DEMESCHON (13), GRADE 8
In Nunavut, many children don't eat much healthy food, they eat mostly junk food. Sometimes they skip meals because their parents can't afford the high prices of food. Hunger happens a lot up here in the North. I think it is wrong that the prices of expired food are cut down low while the rest stay the same. It is unfair. Also, fast food is less expensive here than healthy food and I personally think it should be the other way around.
Many people are concerned by the high costs. On Facebook, there are many complaints on the prices and there is a page that is called ""Feeding my Family,"" which is filled with tons of pictures of the price tags of all different sorts of food from our local stores. The prices we have here in Nunavut are so high compared to the ones down south. Whenever Inuit travel somewhere besides Nunavut and go to a market, they're shocked that they can buy much more food than in Nunavut.
It's sad seeing Inuit buy groceries because they cannot buy many of the things that they need. Even just buying a couple of the plastic bags of food can equal up to $100, and the food they're buying can last only a couple of days. Families often struggle to eat and fill their stomachs, and it's no fun going to school or work while your stomach is growling!
I think that the government needs to make a change to the high food costs in Nunavut to make families happier instead of having an empty fridge. I hope that one day it happens and people can just walk through the aisles in the store and finally get to see low-priced food in their communities. It is overwhelming to see how many families can't afford it.
GRACE SALOMONIE (12), GRADE 7
In the Arctic, there are animals we hunt, eat and wear as traditional clothing. Inuit have been living like this for thousands of years. But what happens when a part of the wildlife is taken away?
People in the North are being forced to pay the price for the southern people's pollution. Global warming will affect the land and animals, which will have major impacts on Inuit culture.
Wildlife was once the only thing Inuit lived off. Inuit used to follow wherever caribou migrated. Inuit have been hunting for thousands of years. Some people hunt for food, others hunt for game. The hunting rate is rising, meaning that more animals are being killed.
The polar bear population is low because of hunting and global warming. There are about 20,000 to 25,000 in the global polar bear population. In 2005, the polar bear population was upgraded from least-concerned to vulnerable by the IUCN Polar Bear Specialist group.
The younger generation here litter because they don't know the importance of the land and what it was to the elders when they were growing up. Hunters bring food when they go out and do not leave their garbage on the land, yet some do and this causes an even greater problem because some animals will eat that garbage. This unfortunate animal will become ill and, in worst cases, die from the garbage.
Caribou is a common animal that we hunt for. Many people hunt for it. The more people that hunt for it, the less the population in caribou. If the caribou go extinct, the food chain of the North will be broken. This will be life-threatening to most carnivorous and herbivorous animals up here and it will gradually affect other food chains negatively. Hunting too much and polluting have devastating consequences to the land and people, so we should show restraint.
MAXWELL COUSINS (12), GRADE 7
There are a lot of concerns facing Nunavut and the people who call it home. One of the biggest concerns that I see on a daily basis involves education. Being in middle school and having classmates that don't attend, it's rather obvious that there's a lack of care shown to the schools and the people who put a lot of work into them. There are a lot of people who aren't able to be successful and have good jobs because they didn't care about their education as a child. While a portion of it can be considered the child's fault, seeing as ultimately they have to make the final choice on whether or not they care about their education, the parents of these children can take the blame as well. If the parents of these children don't care enough about their offspring's education to just make sure that they get on the bus, then how much do they really care?
When it comes down to the schools and those who help run them, it's not bad at all. Through hard work and dedication, anyone who tries can go from kindergarten here to postsecondary education anywhere else. This has happened in the past, and it seems that it can only get better with more students following through and going on to colleges and universities. If more effort were put into school by the students, they would be able to realize their dreams and perhaps represent Nunavut and themselves in a positive way in the future.
The education system here isn't perfect, and I doubt it ever will be. But with a little more effort and dedication, it can be what we all need it to be.
ZACHERY CARPENTER (11), GRADE 6
I have lived in Iqaluit all my life. I know there are issues in Nunavut. However, my life has been good, and I believe there are more good things about living in Nunavut than bad.
One problem in Nunavut is the number of people who smoke cigarettes. Smoking makes people unhealthy and causes sickness. A lot of adults smoke, but a lot of kids in Nunavut smoke as well. Smoking also causes people to have less money because cigarettes cost a lot in Nunavut.
Another problem in Nunavut is addiction to drugs and alcohol. Being addicted to drugs and alcohol is bad because people become unhealthy, sick, drunk and waste their money. If there are children in a house with adults who use drugs and alcohol, it is very scary and dangerous for them.
Another problem in Nunavut is the high prices, which increase poverty. This means people cannot afford healthy food, good clothing or a nice house.
However, there are many good things about living in Nunavut. One of the best things is the outdoors. In the summer you can go boating, camping and hiking out on the land whenever you like. The summer here is also fun because it is light out all day and all night, which means you can play outside any time you like. In the winter you can go snowmobiling and sledding lots. You can also build snow forts for days.
It's also good growing up in Nunavut because of the small towns. This means that it is easy to visit family and friends because it only takes a few minutes to drive or walk to places. It also means families can spend meal times together more easily than in the South. Small towns are also good because wherever you go people know you and it's hard to feel lonely.
Another cool thing about living in Nunavut is the blizzards. Blizzards are great because you get time off of school to rest or do something fun or special. Blizzards are also good because you get to watch movies, lay around and play outside. Blizzards also bring a lot of snow and huge snow drifts to play on, or dig in, for hours.
Although there are things I really like about visiting the South, I like living in Nunavut and I have had a good life in Nunavut so far.
KIARA JANES (11), GRADE 6
Many people tend to focus on the many challenges facing Nunavut. But what most people should remember is Nunavut is a fairly new territory which has undergone a lot of changes in a very short time. It was only 60 years ago when the Inuit were living a nomadic way of life and living in igloos and tents. Many of the issues in our territory can be attributed to this sudden and radical change in lifestyle. So instead of focusing on some of Nunavut's challenges, I am choosing to celebrate some of the unique qualities of our territory.
One of Nunavut's unique qualities is art. Nunavut has many pieces of jewellery, carvings, paintings and murals. It's wonderful when you sit down at the Frobisher Inn restaurant in Iqaluit and see these kind people come to your table with their pieces of art that they have created. The new hospital in Iqaluit has a very creative and unique mural on it. It was painted by Jonathan Cruz. The painting is a picture of some things that represent the Arctic.
Nunavut has so many pieces of art that truly capture the beauty of the Arctic. Jewellery, carvings, paintings and murals are not the only forms of art in Nunavut. There is throat singing and drum dancing.
Throat singing and drum dancing is a very traditional art in Nunavut. Throat singers and drum dancers perform at many celebrations and also show their talents outside of Nunavut. Students from Inuksuk High School have gone to the Arctic Winter Games to show their wonderful talent of throat singing and drum dancing.
Painting murals, carving, jewellery making and throat singing and drum dancing are wonderful arts in Nunavut. Nunavut is a wonderful place, filled with artistic people and things.
And that is the amazing art of Nunavut.
ASINI WIJESOORIYA (13), GRADE 8
The cold, isolated territory found in the North on the map of Canada is unknown to the majority of the people. However, there is a culture which is respected and believed by the Inuit people a long time ago, but presently stumbling to continue.
Today, Iqaluit has many technologies and devices. As the years have gone by, many people from different ethnic backgrounds have come to Iqaluit, but their arrival influences young Inuit children to act and behave differently. This causes them to be distracted from their culture by the variety of people and the modern entertainment which young children have become accustomed to. This is becoming a problem because grandparents and parents want them to carry their culture on to the next generation, but the present generation cannot do this if the schools, the community and family are not helping enough to help keep the culture alive. It is also partly the individual's problem, too. If that person is more intrigued to kill zombies in their video games or do their makeup than learning their own culture, how are they going to teach their own children in the future?
In schools, the teachers and elders are not providing enough Inuit activities to teach the Inuit children what life was like as a true and strong Inuk. Compared to the other communities in Nunavut, Iqaluit has a variety of cultural backgrounds. For example, the majority of citizens in Clyde River are Inuit, so it is much more important for that community to teach the youth the importance of the Inuit culture. Schools there are teaching the students how to survive on the land with certain equipment and how to make Inuit clothing. In Iqaluit, we occasionally have culture-related activities and we have Inuktitut classes for 40 minutes every day. This is unfortunately insufficient for the Inuit children to learn about their own culture.
The Inuit culture is extremely important for the new generation in Nunavut. Having the new generation of children carry it on gives them a connection to their family's past and shows them that continuing their culture will help the Inuit culture blossom once more.
JOY NOWDLUK (13), GRADE 8
Growing up in Nunavut as a young Inuk I try to learn everything I need to know. But I'm learning in a different way than my parents did. With my father growing up speaking Inuktitut and my mom speaking English, I'm having a hard time learning Inuktitut even more. Because I have to go to school, I never have time to go on the land with my dad.
The traditional language of Inuit is Inuktitut. While Inuktitut is one of the strongest aboriginal languages in Canada, not as many people use it any more. I think one of the main reasons it is decreasing is because of the media. The media such as TV, radio and social media like Facebook are mainly in English. There are not a lot of articles and shows that are written or spoken in Inuktitut.
Another reason that the use of Inuktitut is decreasing is that we do not have a lot teachers who speak Inuktitut and the teachers don't have a lot of resources in Inuktitut. This means that they usually teach us in English. We do have one [class] in Inuktitut, but it is not enough to make us fluent. If we had more teachers who spoke Inuktitut and the teachers had more resources, then maybe we would become better at speaking and reading it.
My friends and I aren't being raised like our grandparents or parents. We are being raised in communities and not on the land. We do not have to hunt for our food, we buy food at the store. We don't have to make our clothes, we can buy them in stores, too. Back then they would travel by dog team, and now we go by cars. We don't know how to hunt like our ancestors or live and learn from the land. We don't have the traditional knowledge of our ancestors.
It is important to keep our language and culture strong because I want my kids to learn what I learned. If we lose our language and culture, then we wouldn't be able to remember what it means to be Inuit, proud and strong people with a fascinating culture. I hope that our culture will last for many generations, so that other people can learn our language and traditions. .

In any given week, Cathy Rose might suture a wound, set a broken bone, prescribe medicine or take an X-ray in the high Arctic hamlet of Resolute Bay (population 214).
Occasionally, she'll be called upon to treat unlucky soldiers or polar explorers and, in rare circumstances, sew up an injured sled dog in Canada's second-most-northerly community – about 600 kilometres north of the Arctic Circle. Ms. Rose is a nurse, not a physician, but like many in her profession across Nunavut, the northernmost of Canada's three territories, she is frequently called upon to provide health care that can't wait until patients see a doctor.
Physicians are based in only a few of Nunavut's 25 communities, so in most towns and hamlets, the largely Inuit population turn first to nurses for medical attention. This includes basic blood work and delivering babies that come early, before mothers can make it to the capital, Iqaluit.
Nursing is a demanding calling anywhere in Canada, but it's especially trying in remote Arctic communities with harsh climates, where the sun disappears below the horizon for months at a time each winter. ""This is not a place to come if you're suffering from seasonal affective disorder,"" says Joanne van Bommel, a nurse working in Arctic Bay, a northern Baffin Island hamlet of about 820.
Still, nurses such as Gail Redpath – in charge in Arctic Bay – thrive on the challenge. Ms. Redpath, who has practised in the North for decades, says her Arctic career is markedly different from her earlier service at a Peterborough, Ont., hospital. ""What I did there is probably one-one hundredth of the job I do here,"" she says. ""I can't imagine leaving this now.""
The job carries a cost. Personal and work life blur together in small communities where residents approach nurses for health advice at the grocery store and an emergency can interrupt the small staff's private lives at a moment's notice. Doctors and medical specialists make regular tours of the communities – and are always a phone call, or teleconference, away – but the day-to-day pressures of running a health centre fall on nurses, the backbone of Nunavut's health-care system.
When an emergency arises in Resolute Bay, Ms. Rose, in charge at the Cornwallis Island hamlet's health centre, says she instinctively checks the weather and develops a backup plan in case flights aren't an option.
On good days, a medevac from Iqaluit, 1,575 kilometres to the south, can arrive in Resolute about six hours after it's summoned to rush urgent-care cases to surgery. On rough days, the time it takes to fly a patient to Iqaluit, or farther south, is anybody's guess.
""Sometimes it's heartbreaking, and sometimes the weather is bad, the plane can't come, and it doesn't always have a happy ending. Mostly it does, but sometimes it can be quite heartbreaking,"" Ms. Rose says.
She refers to herself as an ""outpost nurse."" The closest equivalent to Arctic nurses in southern communities might be nurse practitioners, health-care professionals with advanced education who carry out some tasks performed by family doctors.
Arctic nurses, though, also develop skills in the most unlikely areas – from troubleshooting the health-centre generator to fixing computers. In late November, for instance, Ms. Rose had to clamber up a boiler room ladder to reboot a malfunctioning telephone system. ""I just kind of laughed because they don't teach you this in nursing school,"" she says.
Health-care providers in the Arctic face some of the toughest challenges in Canada, including high rates of infant mortality, of suicide among young people, of sexually transmitted disease and smoking. However, nurses say the small communities can also make the job more rewarding. They can track the difference they make in their charges' lives. They see a baby and then the next patient might be the child's grandmother.
""You've got the whole spectrum of life in front of you and you can be involved in it and influence it,"" Ms. Redpath says. ""There's nothing nicer than hearing, 'I quit smoking because you told me to.'… It's like you might have saved somebody's life in the long run.""
Remote living also offers nurses a front-row seat on the marvel of Arctic wilderness. Ms. Rose talks of her stint in Grise Fiord, Canada's northernmost community, when people banded together to keep polar bears from raiding a pod of beluga whales trapped by the sea ice – a situation that had turned into a ""24-hour all-you-can-eat"" for the predators.
""People went out and [chased] the bears away and used chainsaws and actually made more breathing holes,"" she recalled. ""They culled the most seriously injured of the belugas to make more room for the ones that weren't injured, and we camped there for a few nights. And the men took turns sitting up to watch for the bears in case they came back.""
Of the more than 265 nurses serving across Nunavut, few were born or raised here. Nunavut's government says 97 per cent came from southern Canada or abroad. The hope is this will change. For more than 13 years, Nunavut Arctic College has offered a nursing program that has so far graduated 37 people – more than half of whom are working in the territory today.
""We're the past,"" Ms. Rose says, referring to herself, originally from Kitchener, Ont., and her Resolute Bay nursing colleague, who hails from Ireland. Of the new homegrown graduates, she says, ""They're the future."" . Julie De Meulemeester is a Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting Student Fellow and medical student at McGill University.
As a fire ripped through Iqaluit’s NorthMart on Nov. 8, the city’s residents were sent into a panic. The community’s largest retailer sold a vast array of items, ranging from clothes to prescription drugs, but was also one of only two major grocery stores catering to the city’s needs.
Every summer, a cargo ship supplies Nunavut with most of its packaged and non-perishable food items. The NorthMart was therefore nearly fully stocked with new goods and wouldn’t be receiving another mass delivery until next year. All replacement goods will need to be flown in – a much more expensive and logistically challenging shipping option that would likely spike the price of already unaffordable food. So, while NorthMart’s storage unit went up in flames, it was easy to foresee the disastrous consequences it might have on the northern community’s access to food.
Alex Yeo, the president of Canadian Retail for the North West Company (NWC), has since announced that prices will not rise owing to the fire and that the NWC will work closely with other retailers to ensure Iqaluit’s needs are met. Dominic Leblanc, the Minister of Intergovernmental and Northern Affairs and Internal Trade, has also reportedly been considering the federally run Nutrition North program’s role in maintaining stable prices, along with different levels of government.
However, the incident cast a momentary spotlight on Nunavut’s complex food-insecurity crisis, and a food system that relies too heavily on a handful of corporations and a grossly inadequate subsidy program.
Every year, the excitement is palpable in the weeks leading up to the SeaLift’s arrival, as the wait for vehicles, furniture and “fresh” packaged food comes to an end. “In fact, in May, June and early July, you’ll find the cheapest food at the stores. That’s because it’s all expired. And the nutritional value is probably not that great,” says Larry Journal, the director of income support for the Department of Family Services. With no road access to communities, Nunavummiut rely entirely on these deliveries and are constrained to paying merchant-set prices.
Perhaps one of the most flagrant injustices is that the Nutrition North program that caters to the Arctic does not bring prices down to match those in southern Canada, even though the precarious situation of many Inuit – and the near impossibility of continuing to live off the land – is the direct result of historical oppression by the Canadian government. The cruel reality is that the Inuit are forced to pay for their isolation, whether that takes the form of expired produce, a $50 pack of toilet paper or a $70 watermelon.
Nutrition North subsidizes healthy and staple foods (such as meats, fruits and vegetables, flour and cooking oil) sold by northern retailers, to help offset the high cost of importing them from southern suppliers and running a northern business. The subsidies are applied at the merchant or supplier level, with the expectation that savings will be passed down to consumers. But the program has received significant criticism from customers and researchers alike owing to its perceived lack of transparency. The list of subsidized items is also restrictive and culturally inappropriate, as it does not include harvested “country food” (other than from a few approved processors) and non-food items such as toilet paper. In fact, Amazon Prime, which unfortunately only caters to Iqaluit, is rumored to have affected food security more than any policy to date; for a relatively small membership fee, it allows Iqaluit’s residents to get free shipping on southern-priced food.
Updating Nutrition North was a 2015 Liberal campaign promise. Last April, five major Inuit organizations (including the Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami and the Nunavut Tunngavik Inc.) withdrew from an advisory committee on Nutrition North’s reform, citing the federal government’s perceived disregard for their concerns and Inuit-specific recommendations. Months later, not all groups have returned to the table. Despite this, Mr. Leblanc said he hopes to be announcing changes to the subsidy program in the coming weeks. He has repeatedly mentioned his commitment to broad consultation with Indigenous groups but has not publicly outlined how he will re-engage with all these Inuit organizations.
Another Liberal promise was the creation of a National Food Policy. The “What We Heard” document (summarizing the concerns and ideas that arose during their extensive consultation process across Canada) was released only a few weeks ago, and one of the priority areas emphasized by Canadians was access to food for Indigenous and northern populations.
With these major changes to food-related programs and policies under way, now is the time for the government to re-engage in meaningful consultation with all the major Inuit organizations. It is imperative that the federal government cease its tokenistic approach to northern food policy and design programs based on the Inuit’s self-identified needs and priorities.
On a rainy, summer day in Iqaluit, Nunavut, a busy mother of six has her hands full – she is caring for three of them, all under three years of age. Still on the stovetop are the remnants of a fried chicken and rice lunch. It’s the last week before her next Income Assistance and Canada Child Tax Benefit payments come in, and she is stretching what little food is left in the family’s pantry.
The woman, who preferred not to give her name, attended Arctic College and used to work as a payroll officer for the Government of Nunavut but had to resign to care for her ailing mother. Then, she had to stay home to look after her babies. She is eager to return to work, but in the meantime, she borrows from close friends or relatives and sells hand-sewn amauti (traditional Inuit parka), among other belongings, on Facebook to earn some income.
Still, it’s not enough. She says the family generally can afford to eat dinner, but that week in particular, with less food than usual, they’re eating just breakfast and lunch, or just lunch.
She also turns to Facebook in search of nutrient-rich “country foods” such as seal or beluga. The age-old Inuit custom of sharing food has transitioned to the modern-day social-media site, where community members often post about cheap or free meat or fish. Her spouse is a laborer and hunter, but without the means to buy hunting equipment in Iqaluit – a boat, snowmobile, qamutiik (sled), truck, guns, ammunition, fuel, GPS and food – and limited hunter support funding, he is essentially too poor to harvest. Notwithstanding that the land was not meant to support such dense populations, subsistence hunting – a cornerstone of Inuit culture and seeming solution to Arctic hunger – has become a luxury that few Inuit can afford.
Her three older children, ages 5, 11 and 13, are down the street at their grandmother’s, dyeing their hair. The at-home kit was a frivolous purchase to celebrate the 11-year-old’s graduation from elementary school. When they return home, the three-bedroom house will once again be at full capacity. The family of eight share their already-cramped subsidized house with a cousin and teenage nephew. A leaky pipe and mould have rendered one bedroom unlivable, so several family members sleep on a couch or a mattress on the living-room floor.
The family spends around $400 a week on groceries. What would be a small budget for 10 people in southern Canada is meagre in the Arctic and leaves nutritious foods mostly out of reach. Baby formula alone costs them around $52 a week.
She learned proper nutrition from her mother, but her eating preferences are still affected by the time she spent living with her father, who, she says, fed her junk food – whatever she wanted, cereal with water, pop, chocolate, candies. It’s the reason why, she says, she doesn’t have many teeth left.
Seventy per cent of Inuit preschoolers are food insecure. And while Nunavut’s children are far from starving, many display signs of malnutrition rarely seen in other parts of North America – from nutritional rickets to missing or decaying teeth. In a country recognized for its universal health coverage and commitment to children’s rights and well-being, food insecurity is an unacceptable status-quo and yet another indicator that we are failing our Indigenous youth.
Nunavut’s relative disenfranchisement has a historical basis. From the 1950s to the 1970s, the Inuit were victims of federal government policies and false promises that forced them to relinquish their nomadic, hunter-gatherer lifestyles and settle into communities. In one or two generations, they adapted to an entirely foreign system of education, housing and employment, all of which have affected access to food.
“I’m the working generation,” says Yvonne Niego, Deputy Minister of Family Services. “My father was born on the land, he was born nomadically, he was born in an igloo. That’s how fast life has changed.” The rapid transition to store-bought food caused a disconnect between the elders’ traditional harvesting knowledge and the expertise needed to purchase and prepare nutritious imported foods, many of which do not even have Inuktitut translations. High-calorie processed foods are more filling and easier to prepare than perishables.
Addressing food insecurity in Nunavut is a matter of abiding by the moral imperative that no Canadian child should go to bed hungry. Demanding anything less than robust, culturally appropriate food-security policies co-designed with the Inuit organizations is remaining complicit in the systematic abuse of the Inuit. And because it has been demonstrated time and time again that investing in tackling the social determinants of health (i.e. education, early childhood development, housing and food security) is less expensive than dealing with their downstream consequences, it is also a question of making sound economic decisions.
Unfortunately, food insecurity is just one of a host of social problems that disproportionately affect the Inuit – entering Canada’s Arctic is akin to crossing a border into an expansive developing country with an incredibly high cost of living. In fact, 52 per cent of Inuit in Inuit Nunangat (the term for the territory spanning four Inuit regions) live in overcrowded homes and only 34 per cent of adults have a high-school diploma (as opposed to 9 per cent and 86 per cent of all Canadians, respectively). And while non-Inuit earn a median income of $92,011 a year before tax in Inuit Nunangat, their Inuit counterparts are only making a median of $23,485.
Income Assistance increased significantly on July 1, 2018. An individual in Iqaluit now receives $682 a month in basic benefits for groceries, with a 10-person household receiving $2,678 a month. However, according to Mr. Journal, these revised benefits only cover approximately 60 per cent of the actual price of food and are based on outdated prices from the 2016 Food Basket and Northern Food Survey.
Beyond the delay in program implementation, Family Services struggles with inadequate funding, high job-vacancy rates (25 per cent as of September, 2018) and working under legislation still dating back to the Northwest Territories. “And one of the other things to keep in mind, that I believe has a much bigger impact than a lot of people think it does, is scales of economy,” Mr. Journal says of the 38,456 Nunavummiut – the people of Nunavut – spread out on 20 per cent of Canada’s landmass. “Cost per person, then, goes way, way, way up.”
However, the Nunavut Food Security Coalition, which regroups the Nunavut-based stakeholders, has still been trying to tackle the issue since 2012. They have made progress on several fronts, including the implementation of a territorywide school breakfast program, according to Tammy Boutilier, the director of poverty reduction for the Department of Family Services. But with a lack of continuity in its representation and membership, as well as untimely food-security data to utilize, its potential has been stinted.
Developing and expanding this coalition to support more grassroots organizations and community-led projects must be a focus for the territorial government. Many impactful initiatives such as community freezers and soup kitchens are tailored to community-specific needs but suffer from a severe lack of funding – which has had real-world consequences for northerners.
It’s 11 a.m. in July in Iqaluit’s Qajuqturvik Food Centre and 22-year-old Marilyn Aupaloosie is hard at work making sandwiches and salad for the hundred or so lunchtime guests the staff expect at noon. The kitchen is bustling as the team prepares 300 portions of free food to accommodate those who come back for seconds or need to take a container home to their loved ones. The Food Centre doubles as a social enterprise; its “Inclusion Café” trains people with disabilities or little prior work experience to prepare them for employment. Along with the daily lunch served at the Centre, the staff prepare the meals for the local shelters and the free lunch delivered to the high school.
Marilyn’s impressive set of cooking skills gives no inkling into her relationship with food growing up, when her family relied on the food bank’s bimonthly distributions of non-perishable items. “My mom always went to the food bank,” she recalls. “It was very rare for us to go to the soup kitchen because she was always drinking so much.” The absence of inpatient alcohol detoxification and treatment centres in Nunavut forced Marilyn’s mother to seek help in Winnipeg, far from her community.
Because of her mother’s struggle with alcoholism, Marilyn moved in with her grandmother at a young age. Her older sister went to live with her aunt. “There were times where my grandma couldn’t get food for us, so she would get food from the elders’ place and bring it home, so we could eat,” she says. “Or during the summer, we’d go to the causeway and she’d have fishnets and stuff like that.”
More than a decade later, Marilyn is struggling to find affordable housing despite her steady income. In Iqaluit, renting an apartment typically costs thousands of dollars a month, which leaves much less money for groceries. Several months ago, she signed up for subsidized housing: “A board member brought over the applications for housing, so I filled them out. More than half the people who were working that day filled one out,” she said. Iqaluit’s housing crisis means that as a single person, she’ll likely be waiting years before being offered a unit.
The main cause of food insecurity in the North is poverty – supermarket food can be several times more expensive than in the south, whereas the median salary and employment rates are much lower than in the rest of Canada. And for myriad reasons (e.g. inadequate child-care options, job shortages and a housing crisis), poverty in the North is an especially intractable problem. It is not easy to break the cycle.
Programs meant to diminish poverty often look good on paper but are faulty in practice. In Nunavut, beneficiaries of income assistance must partake in one of several “productive choices” meant to inch them closer to financial independence. They include options such as harvesting (hunting, fishing and trapping), alcohol and drug counselling, mental-health counseling, employment-preparedness courses and family support. These options seem fantastic at face value, but many of the resources and infrastructures required to make them viable and robust are barely or non-existent in Nunavut.
For years, the poverty-reduction strategy in Nunavut was skewed due to a lack of a policy definition of poverty or clear indicators of progress. It wasn’t until 2017 that these problems were addressed. “So, I look at the end poverty strategy,” says Madeleine Redfern, the Mayor of Iqaluit, “and some of it is really solid and sound, but without the baseline data, you have no ability to even know, [if the] initiatives that the government is taking are helping people get out of poverty and become food secure.”
Other systemic flaws arise because of Nunavut’s most unique features: its Inuit languages and isolation from the rest of Canada. Approximately two-thirds of Nunavut’s residents speak an Inuit language as their mother tongue, but there is not a single federal web page (i.e. Canada Pension Plan or Old Age Security) available in Inuktitut.
In the communities, earning an income that allows for food security can be out of reach even for those who are practically qualified. With jobs often limited to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, health centres, municipality, schools, grocery stores and government services, “even now in 2018, you could be graduating school, you could have a desire to work, but until someone leaves their job, either voluntarily, or leaves the community to work somewhere else, or is fired or dies, that job doesn’t exist anymore,” Ms. Redfern says.
Homelessness, too, is at the centre of food insecurity in Nunavut, as limited access to kitchens leads to a reliance on expensive ready-made food. A new transitional home for Iqaluit’s absolute homeless is in the works, but most homeless people in Nunavut are deemed ‘hidden’ – couch surfers without a permanent address. Immediate housing options in Nunavut include enrolling in Arctic College (where students and their families are offered an apartment) or scoring a job with the Government of Nunavut that includes housing. But the Inuit continue to be underrepresented in the latter option.
Additional infrastructure (from housing to rehabilitation centres) and investment in strong poverty-reduction planning and programming is urgently needed. As all northern crises feed into each other, an unrelenting approach to poverty is required to truly tackle hunger.
Pauloosie Pudloo, his spouse and their five children (aged 10 months, 6, 8, 11 and 14) know poverty and homelessness all too well. When we met in mid-July, they had been evicted from their (standard-price) $3,050-a-month, three-bedroom apartment a month and a half ago and had since been living in a wooden shack on the beach. The housing authorities knew they were there, but with every public housing unit in the city filled, there was nowhere for them to go. In fact, Mr. Pudloo had been on the list for subsidized housing for the past six years.
The shed was initially built by Mr. Pudloo and his father to store their hunting supplies, so it had no insulation. It offered adequate shelter in summer weather, but with temperatures dipping to minus-40 C in the winter, the family was getting desperate for permanent housing. They had a bucket toilet and used a Coleman stove for cooking and heating. The fumes from the stove were unbearable (short of being unbreathable) and they lived with the fear that their lantern would fall over and cause a fire – the demise of several other shacks that year. Mr. Pudloo sometimes sat aside and tended to the stove at night, which also made room for the rest of his family on their sole mattress. For the Pudloos, respite came in the form of cheap city-run day camps, kid sleepovers and sharing of country food: “There’s an elder here, every once in a while, he brings me a pound of seal meat,” Mr. Pudloo said.
Food insecurity has always been a part of the family’s narrative, with their $1,500 of income assistance only lasting approximately two weeks even back when they were housed. Mr. Pudloo sometimes visited the soup kitchen or went up to five days without eating so that his kids wouldn’t go hungry. He instead filled up on water and coffee. “I know a lot of parents that do the same thing I do,” he said. “I’m not sure if it’s that extreme, but I know of some of them that go a day or two without eating so that their kids can eat.”
Since they had been homeless and relied on ready-made meals, the Pudloos’ grocery costs had gone up dramatically, with a dinner costing them around $90. And with a baby still on formula and in diapers, expenses added up quickly.
In the summertime, Mr. Pudloo’s income comes from net fishing at Iqaluit’s causeway: “People usually call me and tell me they want some fish, then I’ll go put my net out. They usually want it in bulk.” Affordable and nutritious Inuit country food, of course, will never be in low demand.

Few people have a better window on Nunavut's youth than John Fanjoy, and few people are so irrepressibly optimistic about the territory's future.
Despite the social concerns that permeate much of his job as vice-principal of the 300-student Aqsarniit Middle School, he insists he works with the world's best kids in the world's best place.
""We have students who have some major issues. We have students who struggle in literacy. But our students, for the most part, are respectful, willing to learn and, above all, love living in Nunavut,"" he said. ""Many of them are pulled in many directions culturally, depending on whether they're at school or at home, but they come here and work hard.""
That resilience in the face of perplexing cultural demands is reflected in the essays here. Heading into their teen years, students at Aqsarniit carry some very grown-up concerns about life in Canada's newest territory: food prices, truancy, over-hunting, global warming, cultural erosion.
""The biggest issue we face is these social problems being brought into the school,"" Mr. Fanjoy said. ""We have students who don't eat enough, students who have substance abuse at home. We try to do a lot to make the school as warm and welcoming a place as possible.""
Mr. Fanjoy realizes he's always working against a historical image problem. Decades of abuse at residential schools created a widespread distrust in public education across the North. A chronic shortage of Inuktitut-speaking teachers and a lack of outdoor education only compound the cultural wariness. Across the territory, just one in four Inuit students finishes high school.
But the kids who stick with it receive an education on par with any school system in the country, according to Mr. Fanjoy. ""We don't have a graduation issue, we have an attendance issue,"" he said. ""People have to realize the idea of daily education is a very new concept in Nunavut. What was the graduation rate of Ontario in, say, 1885? It's an evolving process. There are students here now who are going to push Nunavut onto great things.""
WHAT NUNAVUT'S YOUTH HAD TO SAY
We asked students at Aqsarniit Middle School to tell the rest of the country about their lives in Nunavut's capital. Here are seven of their written responses.
ROSALINA DEMESCHON (13), GRADE 8
In Nunavut, many children don't eat much healthy food, they eat mostly junk food. Sometimes they skip meals because their parents can't afford the high prices of food. Hunger happens a lot up here in the North. I think it is wrong that the prices of expired food are cut down low while the rest stay the same. It is unfair. Also, fast food is less expensive here than healthy food and I personally think it should be the other way around.
Many people are concerned by the high costs. On Facebook, there are many complaints on the prices and there is a page that is called ""Feeding my Family,"" which is filled with tons of pictures of the price tags of all different sorts of food from our local stores. The prices we have here in Nunavut are so high compared to the ones down south. Whenever Inuit travel somewhere besides Nunavut and go to a market, they're shocked that they can buy much more food than in Nunavut.
It's sad seeing Inuit buy groceries because they cannot buy many of the things that they need. Even just buying a couple of the plastic bags of food can equal up to $100, and the food they're buying can last only a couple of days. Families often struggle to eat and fill their stomachs, and it's no fun going to school or work while your stomach is growling!
I think that the government needs to make a change to the high food costs in Nunavut to make families happier instead of having an empty fridge. I hope that one day it happens and people can just walk through the aisles in the store and finally get to see low-priced food in their communities. It is overwhelming to see how many families can't afford it.
GRACE SALOMONIE (12), GRADE 7
In the Arctic, there are animals we hunt, eat and wear as traditional clothing. Inuit have been living like this for thousands of years. But what happens when a part of the wildlife is taken away?
People in the North are being forced to pay the price for the southern people's pollution. Global warming will affect the land and animals, which will have major impacts on Inuit culture.
Wildlife was once the only thing Inuit lived off. Inuit used to follow wherever caribou migrated. Inuit have been hunting for thousands of years. Some people hunt for food, others hunt for game. The hunting rate is rising, meaning that more animals are being killed.
The polar bear population is low because of hunting and global warming. There are about 20,000 to 25,000 in the global polar bear population. In 2005, the polar bear population was upgraded from least-concerned to vulnerable by the IUCN Polar Bear Specialist group.
The younger generation here litter because they don't know the importance of the land and what it was to the elders when they were growing up. Hunters bring food when they go out and do not leave their garbage on the land, yet some do and this causes an even greater problem because some animals will eat that garbage. This unfortunate animal will become ill and, in worst cases, die from the garbage.
Caribou is a common animal that we hunt for. Many people hunt for it. The more people that hunt for it, the less the population in caribou. If the caribou go extinct, the food chain of the North will be broken. This will be life-threatening to most carnivorous and herbivorous animals up here and it will gradually affect other food chains negatively. Hunting too much and polluting have devastating consequences to the land and people, so we should show restraint.
MAXWELL COUSINS (12), GRADE 7
There are a lot of concerns facing Nunavut and the people who call it home. One of the biggest concerns that I see on a daily basis involves education. Being in middle school and having classmates that don't attend, it's rather obvious that there's a lack of care shown to the schools and the people who put a lot of work into them. There are a lot of people who aren't able to be successful and have good jobs because they didn't care about their education as a child. While a portion of it can be considered the child's fault, seeing as ultimately they have to make the final choice on whether or not they care about their education, the parents of these children can take the blame as well. If the parents of these children don't care enough about their offspring's education to just make sure that they get on the bus, then how much do they really care?
When it comes down to the schools and those who help run them, it's not bad at all. Through hard work and dedication, anyone who tries can go from kindergarten here to postsecondary education anywhere else. This has happened in the past, and it seems that it can only get better with more students following through and going on to colleges and universities. If more effort were put into school by the students, they would be able to realize their dreams and perhaps represent Nunavut and themselves in a positive way in the future.
The education system here isn't perfect, and I doubt it ever will be. But with a little more effort and dedication, it can be what we all need it to be.
ZACHERY CARPENTER (11), GRADE 6
I have lived in Iqaluit all my life. I know there are issues in Nunavut. However, my life has been good, and I believe there are more good things about living in Nunavut than bad.
One problem in Nunavut is the number of people who smoke cigarettes. Smoking makes people unhealthy and causes sickness. A lot of adults smoke, but a lot of kids in Nunavut smoke as well. Smoking also causes people to have less money because cigarettes cost a lot in Nunavut.
Another problem in Nunavut is addiction to drugs and alcohol. Being addicted to drugs and alcohol is bad because people become unhealthy, sick, drunk and waste their money. If there are children in a house with adults who use drugs and alcohol, it is very scary and dangerous for them.
Another problem in Nunavut is the high prices, which increase poverty. This means people cannot afford healthy food, good clothing or a nice house.
However, there are many good things about living in Nunavut. One of the best things is the outdoors. In the summer you can go boating, camping and hiking out on the land whenever you like. The summer here is also fun because it is light out all day and all night, which means you can play outside any time you like. In the winter you can go snowmobiling and sledding lots. You can also build snow forts for days.
It's also good growing up in Nunavut because of the small towns. This means that it is easy to visit family and friends because it only takes a few minutes to drive or walk to places. It also means families can spend meal times together more easily than in the South. Small towns are also good because wherever you go people know you and it's hard to feel lonely.
Another cool thing about living in Nunavut is the blizzards. Blizzards are great because you get time off of school to rest or do something fun or special. Blizzards are also good because you get to watch movies, lay around and play outside. Blizzards also bring a lot of snow and huge snow drifts to play on, or dig in, for hours.
Although there are things I really like about visiting the South, I like living in Nunavut and I have had a good life in Nunavut so far.
KIARA JANES (11), GRADE 6
Many people tend to focus on the many challenges facing Nunavut. But what most people should remember is Nunavut is a fairly new territory which has undergone a lot of changes in a very short time. It was only 60 years ago when the Inuit were living a nomadic way of life and living in igloos and tents. Many of the issues in our territory can be attributed to this sudden and radical change in lifestyle. So instead of focusing on some of Nunavut's challenges, I am choosing to celebrate some of the unique qualities of our territory.
One of Nunavut's unique qualities is art. Nunavut has many pieces of jewellery, carvings, paintings and murals. It's wonderful when you sit down at the Frobisher Inn restaurant in Iqaluit and see these kind people come to your table with their pieces of art that they have created. The new hospital in Iqaluit has a very creative and unique mural on it. It was painted by Jonathan Cruz. The painting is a picture of some things that represent the Arctic.
Nunavut has so many pieces of art that truly capture the beauty of the Arctic. Jewellery, carvings, paintings and murals are not the only forms of art in Nunavut. There is throat singing and drum dancing.
Throat singing and drum dancing is a very traditional art in Nunavut. Throat singers and drum dancers perform at many celebrations and also show their talents outside of Nunavut. Students from Inuksuk High School have gone to the Arctic Winter Games to show their wonderful talent of throat singing and drum dancing.
Painting murals, carving, jewellery making and throat singing and drum dancing are wonderful arts in Nunavut. Nunavut is a wonderful place, filled with artistic people and things.
And that is the amazing art of Nunavut.
ASINI WIJESOORIYA (13), GRADE 8
The cold, isolated territory found in the North on the map of Canada is unknown to the majority of the people. However, there is a culture which is respected and believed by the Inuit people a long time ago, but presently stumbling to continue.
Today, Iqaluit has many technologies and devices. As the years have gone by, many people from different ethnic backgrounds have come to Iqaluit, but their arrival influences young Inuit children to act and behave differently. This causes them to be distracted from their culture by the variety of people and the modern entertainment which young children have become accustomed to. This is becoming a problem because grandparents and parents want them to carry their culture on to the next generation, but the present generation cannot do this if the schools, the community and family are not helping enough to help keep the culture alive. It is also partly the individual's problem, too. If that person is more intrigued to kill zombies in their video games or do their makeup than learning their own culture, how are they going to teach their own children in the future?
In schools, the teachers and elders are not providing enough Inuit activities to teach the Inuit children what life was like as a true and strong Inuk. Compared to the other communities in Nunavut, Iqaluit has a variety of cultural backgrounds. For example, the majority of citizens in Clyde River are Inuit, so it is much more important for that community to teach the youth the importance of the Inuit culture. Schools there are teaching the students how to survive on the land with certain equipment and how to make Inuit clothing. In Iqaluit, we occasionally have culture-related activities and we have Inuktitut classes for 40 minutes every day. This is unfortunately insufficient for the Inuit children to learn about their own culture.
The Inuit culture is extremely important for the new generation in Nunavut. Having the new generation of children carry it on gives them a connection to their family's past and shows them that continuing their culture will help the Inuit culture blossom once more.
JOY NOWDLUK (13), GRADE 8
Growing up in Nunavut as a young Inuk I try to learn everything I need to know. But I'm learning in a different way than my parents did. With my father growing up speaking Inuktitut and my mom speaking English, I'm having a hard time learning Inuktitut even more. Because I have to go to school, I never have time to go on the land with my dad.
The traditional language of Inuit is Inuktitut. While Inuktitut is one of the strongest aboriginal languages in Canada, not as many people use it any more. I think one of the main reasons it is decreasing is because of the media. The media such as TV, radio and social media like Facebook are mainly in English. There are not a lot of articles and shows that are written or spoken in Inuktitut.
Another reason that the use of Inuktitut is decreasing is that we do not have a lot teachers who speak Inuktitut and the teachers don't have a lot of resources in Inuktitut. This means that they usually teach us in English. We do have one [class] in Inuktitut, but it is not enough to make us fluent. If we had more teachers who spoke Inuktitut and the teachers had more resources, then maybe we would become better at speaking and reading it.
My friends and I aren't being raised like our grandparents or parents. We are being raised in communities and not on the land. We do not have to hunt for our food, we buy food at the store. We don't have to make our clothes, we can buy them in stores, too. Back then they would travel by dog team, and now we go by cars. We don't know how to hunt like our ancestors or live and learn from the land. We don't have the traditional knowledge of our ancestors.
It is important to keep our language and culture strong because I want my kids to learn what I learned. If we lose our language and culture, then we wouldn't be able to remember what it means to be Inuit, proud and strong people with a fascinating culture. I hope that our culture will last for many generations, so that other people can learn our language and traditions. .

As a fire ripped through Iqaluit’s NorthMart on Nov. 8, the city’s residents were sent into a panic. The community’s largest retailer sold a vast array of items, ranging from clothes to prescription drugs, but was also one of only two major grocery stores catering to the city’s needs.
Every summer, a cargo ship supplies Nunavut with most of its packaged and non-perishable food items. The NorthMart was therefore nearly fully stocked with new goods and wouldn’t be receiving another mass delivery until next year. All replacement goods will need to be flown in – a much more expensive and logistically challenging shipping option that would likely spike the price of already unaffordable food. So, while NorthMart’s storage unit went up in flames, it was easy to foresee the disastrous consequences it might have on the northern community’s access to food.
Alex Yeo, the president of Canadian Retail for the North West Company (NWC), has since announced that prices will not rise owing to the fire and that the NWC will work closely with other retailers to ensure Iqaluit’s needs are met. Dominic Leblanc, the Minister of Intergovernmental and Northern Affairs and Internal Trade, has also reportedly been considering the federally run Nutrition North program’s role in maintaining stable prices, along with different levels of government.
However, the incident cast a momentary spotlight on Nunavut’s complex food-insecurity crisis, and a food system that relies too heavily on a handful of corporations and a grossly inadequate subsidy program.
Every year, the excitement is palpable in the weeks leading up to the SeaLift’s arrival, as the wait for vehicles, furniture and “fresh” packaged food comes to an end. “In fact, in May, June and early July, you’ll find the cheapest food at the stores. That’s because it’s all expired. And the nutritional value is probably not that great,” says Larry Journal, the director of income support for the Department of Family Services. With no road access to communities, Nunavummiut rely entirely on these deliveries and are constrained to paying merchant-set prices.
Perhaps one of the most flagrant injustices is that the Nutrition North program that caters to the Arctic does not bring prices down to match those in southern Canada, even though the precarious situation of many Inuit – and the near impossibility of continuing to live off the land – is the direct result of historical oppression by the Canadian government. The cruel reality is that the Inuit are forced to pay for their isolation, whether that takes the form of expired produce, a $50 pack of toilet paper or a $70 watermelon.
Nutrition North subsidizes healthy and staple foods (such as meats, fruits and vegetables, flour and cooking oil) sold by northern retailers, to help offset the high cost of importing them from southern suppliers and running a northern business. The subsidies are applied at the merchant or supplier level, with the expectation that savings will be passed down to consumers. But the program has received significant criticism from customers and researchers alike owing to its perceived lack of transparency. The list of subsidized items is also restrictive and culturally inappropriate, as it does not include harvested “country food” (other than from a few approved processors) and non-food items such as toilet paper. In fact, Amazon Prime, which unfortunately only caters to Iqaluit, is rumored to have affected food security more than any policy to date; for a relatively small membership fee, it allows Iqaluit’s residents to get free shipping on southern-priced food.
Updating Nutrition North was a 2015 Liberal campaign promise. Last April, five major Inuit organizations (including the Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami and the Nunavut Tunngavik Inc.) withdrew from an advisory committee on Nutrition North’s reform, citing the federal government’s perceived disregard for their concerns and Inuit-specific recommendations. Months later, not all groups have returned to the table. Despite this, Mr. Leblanc said he hopes to be announcing changes to the subsidy program in the coming weeks. He has repeatedly mentioned his commitment to broad consultation with Indigenous groups but has not publicly outlined how he will re-engage with all these Inuit organizations.
Another Liberal promise was the creation of a National Food Policy. The “What We Heard” document (summarizing the concerns and ideas that arose during their extensive consultation process across Canada) was released only a few weeks ago, and one of the priority areas emphasized by Canadians was access to food for Indigenous and northern populations.
With these major changes to food-related programs and policies under way, now is the time for the government to re-engage in meaningful consultation with all the major Inuit organizations. It is imperative that the federal government cease its tokenistic approach to northern food policy and design programs based on the Inuit’s self-identified needs and priorities.
On a rainy, summer day in Iqaluit, Nunavut, a busy mother of six has her hands full – she is caring for three of them, all under three years of age. Still on the stovetop are the remnants of a fried chicken and rice lunch. It’s the last week before her next Income Assistance and Canada Child Tax Benefit payments come in, and she is stretching what little food is left in the family’s pantry.
The woman, who preferred not to give her name, attended Arctic College and used to work as a payroll officer for the Government of Nunavut but had to resign to care for her ailing mother. Then, she had to stay home to look after her babies. She is eager to return to work, but in the meantime, she borrows from close friends or relatives and sells hand-sewn amauti (traditional Inuit parka), among other belongings, on Facebook to earn some income.
Still, it’s not enough. She says the family generally can afford to eat dinner, but that week in particular, with less food than usual, they’re eating just breakfast and lunch, or just lunch.
She also turns to Facebook in search of nutrient-rich “country foods” such as seal or beluga. The age-old Inuit custom of sharing food has transitioned to the modern-day social-media site, where community members often post about cheap or free meat or fish. Her spouse is a laborer and hunter, but without the means to buy hunting equipment in Iqaluit – a boat, snowmobile, qamutiik (sled), truck, guns, ammunition, fuel, GPS and food – and limited hunter support funding, he is essentially too poor to harvest. Notwithstanding that the land was not meant to support such dense populations, subsistence hunting – a cornerstone of Inuit culture and seeming solution to Arctic hunger – has become a luxury that few Inuit can afford.
Her three older children, ages 5, 11 and 13, are down the street at their grandmother’s, dyeing their hair. The at-home kit was a frivolous purchase to celebrate the 11-year-old’s graduation from elementary school. When they return home, the three-bedroom house will once again be at full capacity. The family of eight share their already-cramped subsidized house with a cousin and teenage nephew. A leaky pipe and mould have rendered one bedroom unlivable, so several family members sleep on a couch or a mattress on the living-room floor.
The family spends around $400 a week on groceries. What would be a small budget for 10 people in southern Canada is meagre in the Arctic and leaves nutritious foods mostly out of reach. Baby formula alone costs them around $52 a week.
She learned proper nutrition from her mother, but her eating preferences are still affected by the time she spent living with her father, who, she says, fed her junk food – whatever she wanted, cereal with water, pop, chocolate, candies. It’s the reason why, she says, she doesn’t have many teeth left.
Seventy per cent of Inuit preschoolers are food insecure. And while Nunavut’s children are far from starving, many display signs of malnutrition rarely seen in other parts of North America – from nutritional rickets to missing or decaying teeth. In a country recognized for its universal health coverage and commitment to children’s rights and well-being, food insecurity is an unacceptable status-quo and yet another indicator that we are failing our Indigenous youth.
Nunavut’s relative disenfranchisement has a historical basis. From the 1950s to the 1970s, the Inuit were victims of federal government policies and false promises that forced them to relinquish their nomadic, hunter-gatherer lifestyles and settle into communities. In one or two generations, they adapted to an entirely foreign system of education, housing and employment, all of which have affected access to food.
“I’m the working generation,” says Yvonne Niego, Deputy Minister of Family Services. “My father was born on the land, he was born nomadically, he was born in an igloo. That’s how fast life has changed.” The rapid transition to store-bought food caused a disconnect between the elders’ traditional harvesting knowledge and the expertise needed to purchase and prepare nutritious imported foods, many of which do not even have Inuktitut translations. High-calorie processed foods are more filling and easier to prepare than perishables.
Addressing food insecurity in Nunavut is a matter of abiding by the moral imperative that no Canadian child should go to bed hungry. Demanding anything less than robust, culturally appropriate food-security policies co-designed with the Inuit organizations is remaining complicit in the systematic abuse of the Inuit. And because it has been demonstrated time and time again that investing in tackling the social determinants of health (i.e. education, early childhood development, housing and food security) is less expensive than dealing with their downstream consequences, it is also a question of making sound economic decisions.
Unfortunately, food insecurity is just one of a host of social problems that disproportionately affect the Inuit – entering Canada’s Arctic is akin to crossing a border into an expansive developing country with an incredibly high cost of living. In fact, 52 per cent of Inuit in Inuit Nunangat (the term for the territory spanning four Inuit regions) live in overcrowded homes and only 34 per cent of adults have a high-school diploma (as opposed to 9 per cent and 86 per cent of all Canadians, respectively). And while non-Inuit earn a median income of $92,011 a year before tax in Inuit Nunangat, their Inuit counterparts are only making a median of $23,485.
Income Assistance increased significantly on July 1, 2018. An individual in Iqaluit now receives $682 a month in basic benefits for groceries, with a 10-person household receiving $2,678 a month. However, according to Mr. Journal, these revised benefits only cover approximately 60 per cent of the actual price of food and are based on outdated prices from the 2016 Food Basket and Northern Food Survey.
Beyond the delay in program implementation, Family Services struggles with inadequate funding, high job-vacancy rates (25 per cent as of September, 2018) and working under legislation still dating back to the Northwest Territories. “And one of the other things to keep in mind, that I believe has a much bigger impact than a lot of people think it does, is scales of economy,” Mr. Journal says of the 38,456 Nunavummiut – the people of Nunavut – spread out on 20 per cent of Canada’s landmass. “Cost per person, then, goes way, way, way up.”
However, the Nunavut Food Security Coalition, which regroups the Nunavut-based stakeholders, has still been trying to tackle the issue since 2012. They have made progress on several fronts, including the implementation of a territorywide school breakfast program, according to Tammy Boutilier, the director of poverty reduction for the Department of Family Services. But with a lack of continuity in its representation and membership, as well as untimely food-security data to utilize, its potential has been stinted.
Developing and expanding this coalition to support more grassroots organizations and community-led projects must be a focus for the territorial government. Many impactful initiatives such as community freezers and soup kitchens are tailored to community-specific needs but suffer from a severe lack of funding – which has had real-world consequences for northerners.
It’s 11 a.m. in July in Iqaluit’s Qajuqturvik Food Centre and 22-year-old Marilyn Aupaloosie is hard at work making sandwiches and salad for the hundred or so lunchtime guests the staff expect at noon. The kitchen is bustling as the team prepares 300 portions of free food to accommodate those who come back for seconds or need to take a container home to their loved ones. The Food Centre doubles as a social enterprise; its “Inclusion Café” trains people with disabilities or little prior work experience to prepare them for employment. Along with the daily lunch served at the Centre, the staff prepare the meals for the local shelters and the free lunch delivered to the high school.
Marilyn’s impressive set of cooking skills gives no inkling into her relationship with food growing up, when her family relied on the food bank’s bimonthly distributions of non-perishable items. “My mom always went to the food bank,” she recalls. “It was very rare for us to go to the soup kitchen because she was always drinking so much.” The absence of inpatient alcohol detoxification and treatment centres in Nunavut forced Marilyn’s mother to seek help in Winnipeg, far from her community.
Because of her mother’s struggle with alcoholism, Marilyn moved in with her grandmother at a young age. Her older sister went to live with her aunt. “There were times where my grandma couldn’t get food for us, so she would get food from the elders’ place and bring it home, so we could eat,” she says. “Or during the summer, we’d go to the causeway and she’d have fishnets and stuff like that.”
More than a decade later, Marilyn is struggling to find affordable housing despite her steady income. In Iqaluit, renting an apartment typically costs thousands of dollars a month, which leaves much less money for groceries. Several months ago, she signed up for subsidized housing: “A board member brought over the applications for housing, so I filled them out. More than half the people who were working that day filled one out,” she said. Iqaluit’s housing crisis means that as a single person, she’ll likely be waiting years before being offered a unit.
The main cause of food insecurity in the North is poverty – supermarket food can be several times more expensive than in the south, whereas the median salary and employment rates are much lower than in the rest of Canada. And for myriad reasons (e.g. inadequate child-care options, job shortages and a housing crisis), poverty in the North is an especially intractable problem. It is not easy to break the cycle.
Programs meant to diminish poverty often look good on paper but are faulty in practice. In Nunavut, beneficiaries of income assistance must partake in one of several “productive choices” meant to inch them closer to financial independence. They include options such as harvesting (hunting, fishing and trapping), alcohol and drug counselling, mental-health counseling, employment-preparedness courses and family support. These options seem fantastic at face value, but many of the resources and infrastructures required to make them viable and robust are barely or non-existent in Nunavut.
For years, the poverty-reduction strategy in Nunavut was skewed due to a lack of a policy definition of poverty or clear indicators of progress. It wasn’t until 2017 that these problems were addressed. “So, I look at the end poverty strategy,” says Madeleine Redfern, the Mayor of Iqaluit, “and some of it is really solid and sound, but without the baseline data, you have no ability to even know, [if the] initiatives that the government is taking are helping people get out of poverty and become food secure.”
Other systemic flaws arise because of Nunavut’s most unique features: its Inuit languages and isolation from the rest of Canada. Approximately two-thirds of Nunavut’s residents speak an Inuit language as their mother tongue, but there is not a single federal web page (i.e. Canada Pension Plan or Old Age Security) available in Inuktitut.
In the communities, earning an income that allows for food security can be out of reach even for those who are practically qualified. With jobs often limited to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, health centres, municipality, schools, grocery stores and government services, “even now in 2018, you could be graduating school, you could have a desire to work, but until someone leaves their job, either voluntarily, or leaves the community to work somewhere else, or is fired or dies, that job doesn’t exist anymore,” Ms. Redfern says.
Homelessness, too, is at the centre of food insecurity in Nunavut, as limited access to kitchens leads to a reliance on expensive ready-made food. A new transitional home for Iqaluit’s absolute homeless is in the works, but most homeless people in Nunavut are deemed ‘hidden’ – couch surfers without a permanent address. Immediate housing options in Nunavut include enrolling in Arctic College (where students and their families are offered an apartment) or scoring a job with the Government of Nunavut that includes housing. But the Inuit continue to be underrepresented in the latter option.
Additional infrastructure (from housing to rehabilitation centres) and investment in strong poverty-reduction planning and programming is urgently needed. As all northern crises feed into each other, an unrelenting approach to poverty is required to truly tackle hunger.
Pauloosie Pudloo, his spouse and their five children (aged 10 months, 6, 8, 11 and 14) know poverty and homelessness all too well. When we met in mid-July, they had been evicted from their (standard-price) $3,050-a-month, three-bedroom apartment a month and a half ago and had since been living in a wooden shack on the beach. The housing authorities knew they were there, but with every public housing unit in the city filled, there was nowhere for them to go. In fact, Mr. Pudloo had been on the list for subsidized housing for the past six years.
The shed was initially built by Mr. Pudloo and his father to store their hunting supplies, so it had no insulation. It offered adequate shelter in summer weather, but with temperatures dipping to minus-40 C in the winter, the family was getting desperate for permanent housing. They had a bucket toilet and used a Coleman stove for cooking and heating. The fumes from the stove were unbearable (short of being unbreathable) and they lived with the fear that their lantern would fall over and cause a fire – the demise of several other shacks that year. Mr. Pudloo sometimes sat aside and tended to the stove at night, which also made room for the rest of his family on their sole mattress. For the Pudloos, respite came in the form of cheap city-run day camps, kid sleepovers and sharing of country food: “There’s an elder here, every once in a while, he brings me a pound of seal meat,” Mr. Pudloo said.
Food insecurity has always been a part of the family’s narrative, with their $1,500 of income assistance only lasting approximately two weeks even back when they were housed. Mr. Pudloo sometimes visited the soup kitchen or went up to five days without eating so that his kids wouldn’t go hungry. He instead filled up on water and coffee. “I know a lot of parents that do the same thing I do,” he said. “I’m not sure if it’s that extreme, but I know of some of them that go a day or two without eating so that their kids can eat.”
Since they had been homeless and relied on ready-made meals, the Pudloos’ grocery costs had gone up dramatically, with a dinner costing them around $90. And with a baby still on formula and in diapers, expenses added up quickly.
In the summertime, Mr. Pudloo’s income comes from net fishing at Iqaluit’s causeway: “People usually call me and tell me they want some fish, then I’ll go put my net out. They usually want it in bulk.” Affordable and nutritious Inuit country food, of course, will never be in low demand.

2018 March Report of the Auditor General of Canada to the Legislative Assembly of NunavutClimate Change in Nunavut
Independent Auditor’s Report
Introduction
Background
1. Environment and Climate Change Canada’s climate data indicates that between 1948 and 2016, average temperatures increased by up to 2.7 degrees Celsius in Nunavut and by 1.7 degrees Celsius in Canada as a whole. In Nunavut, these rises in temperature have caused changes to ice conditions, permafrost, and precipitation. The Government of Nunavut’s Department of Environment has reported that this warming trend will likely continue.
2. Climate change research and local and traditional Inuit knowledge also indicate that Nunavut’s climate is changing. Exhibit 1 lists some of the impacts of climate change on Nunavut and the Arctic. While not all impacts can be attributed to climate change, it is a major factor.
Exhibit 1—Examples of impacts of climate change on Nunavut and the Arctic
Type of change: Warming
Impacts: Arctic sea ice has reduced.
Examples:
- The shortened and less reliable ice season has affected those who travel on sea ice. It affects cultural connections with the local environment as well as hunting and fishing, which can affect income and food security.
- Researchers have found that reduced sea ice has led to increased shipping activity in some areas surrounding Nunavut. This presents Nunavut with economic opportunities but also increases the risk of incidents that require emergency response, such as fuel spills.
- Less ice means less protection from waves and storm surges. Researchers have identified the communities of Clyde River, Hall Beach, and Kugluktuk as being vulnerable to coastal erosion and flooding.
Impacts: Permafrost is warming.
Example:
- Nunavut’s communities are built on permafrost, which is ground that has been frozen for two or more years. Warming air and ground temperatures have caused permafrost to warm. In some areas of Nunavut, warming permafrost has created hazards for residents, affected some land-based travel routes, and presented risks to archaeological sites. Thawing permafrost also poses risks to infrastructure, such as shifting, foundation distress, and other structural problems in buildings.
Type of change: Changing precipitation levels
Impacts: The annual average amount of regional snowfall has increased. Snow is melting earlier in the year.
Examples:
- In some instances, severe rain events have led to local flooding and washouts. For example, in Pangnirtung in 2008, significant damage to two bridges from a rainstorm and rapid snowmelt prevented access to the community’s water reservoir, sewage treatment plant, and landfill site.
- In Coral Harbour in 2012, significant damage to a road and bridge from rain and rapid snowmelt caused the community to be without access to its airport for about one week. The flooding also damaged the resupply pipeline for the community’s fuel tank farm.

3. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a leading cause of climate change is the emission into the atmosphere of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, from fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes. Although Nunavut is a small emitter of greenhouse gases, it is particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.
4. Virtually all of Nunavut’s greenhouse gas emissions come from using fossil fuels, such as diesel, gasoline, and jet fuel. These fuels are used for a variety of purposes, such as for generating electricity, for heating homes, and for various modes of transportation, and play a key role in the daily lives of Nunavummiut (the people of Nunavut). Providing reliable energy to Nunavut’s communities is particularly critical given the territory’s cold Arctic winters, during which average monthly temperatures in some communities are minus 25 degrees Celsius and below.
5. Nunavut relies entirely on imported fuels, which are supplied by ship to communities during the summer season. This makes the territory vulnerable to price increases, unforeseen supply disruptions, and fuel spills.
6. In its efforts to help Nunavut adapt to climate change and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the Government of Nunavut faces a number of challenges, such as
- delivering programs to and managing infrastructure in 25 communities, which are spread across almost 2 million square kilometres and are difficult to access (by air year-round and by sealift);
- addressing immediate priorities in areas such as health, housing, and education; and
- dealing with constraints on human resources, including high vacancies and staff turnover within the government.
7. Responding to the impacts of climate change is a shared responsibility. It requires collaboration within and across governments, and with municipalities, Inuit and non-governmental organizations, industry, and the public.
8. The Department of Environment’s Climate Change Secretariat is the lead for climate change in the territory. The result of a merger at the end of 2016 between the Department of Environment’s Climate Change Section and the Department of Economic Development and Transportation’s Energy Secretariat, the Climate Change Secretariat is responsible for managing the Government of Nunavut’s climate change policies and programs. This includes
Adaptation—Actions taken to prevent or reduce the negative impacts of climate change and/or build on positive impacts.
- developing adaptation programs, policies, and partnerships, which assist Nunavut in adapting to and minimizing the projected impacts of climate change;
- leading the inter-agency development of strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to lessen the territory’s reliance on imported diesel;
- encouraging the exchange of knowledge and information about climate change based on science and Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit (that is, traditional Inuit knowledge and values); and
- coordinating climate change actions for government departments, agencies, and communities.
9. A number of other government departments also have roles in preparing Nunavut to adapt to climate change and reducing its greenhouse gas emissions, such as
- the Department of Community and Government Services, which manages government-owned property;
- the Nunavut Housing Corporation, which manages almost 7,000 public and staff housing units; and
- the Qulliq Energy Corporation, Nunavut’s public utility.
Focus of the audit
10. This audit focused on whether selected Government of Nunavut organizations took measures to prepare for and adapt to the impacts of climate change on Nunavut and took measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in Nunavut.
11. This audit is important because climate change is affecting the daily life, traditional activities, and infrastructure in Nunavut. The government needs to know what it has to do to help the people of Nunavut adapt and make the territory resilient to the impacts of climate change. Increasing energy efficiency and using more renewable energy help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the territory’s dependence on fossil fuels.
12. We examined whether the Government of Nunavut had
- developed a strategy for adapting to climate change and reducing greenhouse gas emissions,
- developed an implementation plan for the strategy,
- monitored and reported on the implementation of its strategy, and
- assessed climate change risks to Nunavut and Nunavummiut.
13. We also examined specific measures that selected government organizations had taken to adapt to climate change and reduce greenhouse gas emissions:
- the efforts of the Department of Community and Government Services and the Nunavut Housing Corporation to adapt to climate change; and
- the efforts of the Department of Community and Government Services, the Nunavut Housing Corporation, and the Qulliq Energy Corporation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
14. We did not examine the role of other Government of Nunavut departments or municipal governments in adapting to the impacts of climate change or in reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
15. In 2016, many legislative audit offices across Canada decided to look at the issue of climate change and developed similar audit approaches and questions to examine climate change action within their governments. As part of this initiative, the Office of the Auditor General of Canada decided to do federal and territorial climate change audits.
16. More details about the audit objective, scope, approach, and criteria are in About the Audit at the end of this report.
Findings, Recommendations, and Responses
Planning and preparing
Overall message
17. Overall, we found that the Government of Nunavut was not adequately prepared to respond to climate change. Although it had strategies for adapting to climate change and managing the territory’s energy use and greenhouse gas emissions, it did not have implementation plans that outlined how and when the objectives of the strategies would be met and who would be responsible for what. It also did not publicly report on its implementation of either strategy. We also found that the Government of Nunavut did not fully assess the risks of climate change to Nunavut.
18. These findings matter because implementation plans provide direction to departments so that they can respond in a coordinated manner to the risks and impacts of climate change. Public reporting informs Nunavummiut about the Government of Nunavut’s progress in addressing climate change and keeps it accountable. Assessing the risks of climate change ensures that the government has the information it needs to direct its actions and resources to the most important areas.
The Government of Nunavut had strategies for adapting to climate change and managing its energy use but lacked plans to implement them
19. We found that the Government of Nunavut had a strategy for responding to the impacts of climate change and a strategy for managing its energy use and reducing its reliance on fossil fuels and greenhouse gases. However, both strategies lacked clear and measurable commitments, and timelines. The government prepared draft implementation plans, which outlined the actions needed to achieve the objectives, along with timelines, deliverables, and responsibilities. However, these plans were never finalized.
20. We also found that the government did not set a target for reducing greenhouse gas emissions or publicly report on the implementation of both of its adaptation and energy strategies.
21. Our analysis supporting this finding presents what we examined and discusses the following topics:
22. This finding matters because strategies and implementation plans give departments direction on the priorities and actions they need to take to adapt to climate change and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Identifying who is responsible for taking action, the expected deliverables, and the related timelines are important for tracking progress and holding the Government of Nunavut accountable for results.
23. Reporting publicly on progress is important because it tells Nunavummiut what the government has done to address the impacts of climate change and to reduce the territory’s greenhouse gas emissions and its reliance on fossil fuels.
24. Our recommendation in this area of examination appears at paragraph 36.
25. What we examined. We examined whether the Government of Nunavut had a strategy and implementation plan for adapting to the impacts of climate change and reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and whether the government publicly reported on progress.
26. Adaptation strategy. In 2011, the Department of Environment released Upagiaqtavut: Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation in Nunavut, a framework for climate change adaptation initiatives in Nunavut. Its purpose is to provide strategic direction and enable Nunavummiut to better adapt to current and future changes brought on by climate change.
27. The strategy contained 11 objectives under 4 themes: partnership building, research and monitoring, education and outreach, and government policy and planning. We found that its objectives focused on actions to be taken, not on outcomes. The strategy did not explain who would be responsible for achieving the objectives and lacked timelines for completing actions.
28. The Government of Nunavut’s Cabinet directed the Department of Environment to work with all departments to develop a plan to implement the strategy. In 2014, the Department of Environment, with input from other departments, produced a five-year draft action plan, which outlined the actions to be taken to achieve the objectives, the timelines for completing these actions, the deliverables, and the responsibilities for completing the actions. We found that the draft action plan was never finalized.
29. Energy strategy. In 2007, the Government of Nunavut released Ikummatiit: The Government of Nunavut Energy Strategy. Covering the period from 2007 to 2020, the strategy aims to reduce Nunavut’s dependence on fossil fuels, improve energy security, and reduce air pollution and greenhouse gases. These objectives are to be achieved by, among other things, increasing energy efficiency and using alternatives to fossil fuels.
30. The strategy contains 42 policy actions designed to fulfill its objectives. We found that it did not state who was responsible for implementing about two thirds of the actions and did not set any timelines for completing actions.
31. After the release of the strategy, Cabinet directed the Energy Secretariat (at the time, located in the Department of Executive and Intergovernmental Affairs) to work with relevant departments to develop an implementation plan for the strategy. We found that, in 2010, the Secretariat produced a detailed draft plan, which included descriptions of how policy actions would be implemented, timelines, deliverables, and responsibilities; however, the plan was never finalized.
32. Monitoring and public reporting. We found that the monitoring of the adaptation and energy strategies was limited. Although both contained commitments to produce annual public reports, these were never produced. An interdepartmental climate change working group was established to coordinate implementation and public reporting for both strategies, but the group was inactive and had not met in many years.
Reduction targets for greenhouse gas emissions—Targets that can be absolute or intensity targets. Absolute targets refer to reducing greenhouse gas emissions over time. Intensity targets refer to reducing the ratio of greenhouse gas emissions over time relative to a particular measurement, such as per capita or gross domestic product (GDP). Both types of targets often have a base year and target year.
33. Reduction targets. We examined whether the Government of Nunavut had set reduction targets for greenhouse gas emissions and whether it was monitoring the territory’s emissions. Targets are important because they communicate what the government wants to achieve and act as a benchmark for measuring progress. Monitoring emissions helps determine whether progress is being made to reduce them.
34. We found that the government did not set targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions or other energy-related targets, such as how much power it wanted to produce using renewable energy. However, we did find that the Climate Change Secretariat was monitoring the territory’s greenhouse gas emissions. A report on energy use and greenhouse gas emission trends in the territory was produced for the Secretariat in early 2017. Department officials told us that they were reviewing the report and expected to use it to establish a comprehensive greenhouse gas inventory.
35. We noted differences between Nunavut’s estimated greenhouse gas emissions and those in Environment and Climate Change Canada’s 2017 national greenhouse gas emission inventory. Although both sources of information indicated that Nunavut’s emissions were increasing, they differed in terms of Nunavut’s total emissions and the share of emissions by sector (for example, transportation, heating, and electricity). Secretariat officials told us that they were investigating these differences and were participating in a federal/territorial working group to improve emission estimates for the territories.
36. Recommendation. The Department of Environment, in collaboration with other key departments, should develop an implementation plan for the Government of Nunavut’s climate change strategies that
- identifies priorities along with concrete actions, timelines, and costs;
- includes reduction targets for greenhouse gas emissions;
- clearly identifies roles and responsibilities, including who is responsible for overseeing the implementation of the plan and accountabilities for implementing actions; and
- requires monitoring and reporting on the plan’s progress.
The plan should consider actions taken to date and be informed by an assessment of climate change risks.
The Department of Environment’s response. Agreed. The Department of Environment, through the Climate Change Secretariat, will collaborate with other key departments to identify priorities, concrete actions, timelines, costs, and implementation plans for climate change strategies. These strategies aim to take action on Nunavut’s greenhouse gas emissions, reliance on diesel fuel, and role in adapting and combatting climate change.
The Climate Change Secretariat was formed in November 2016 and has since begun work on a variety of foundational projects that will well position the Department of Environment to facilitate responding to such a recommendation. Preliminary work on community energy planning, greenhouse gas emissions, and alternative energy inventories will support the Government of Nunavut’s ability to identify realistic and reasonable greenhouse gas emission targets.
The Government of Nunavut did not fully assess the risks of climate change
37. We found that the Government of Nunavut did not fully assess the risks of climate change to Nunavut and Nunavummiut. For example, it did not assess which communities might be at greatest risk, how climate change could affect the delivery of government programs and services, and the impacts of climate change on biodiversity. We found that the government did assess risks for selected topics, such as the risks of climate change to sources of drinking water in communities. For seven communities, it also produced maps that identified areas unsuitable for development due to risks from the thawing of permafrost.
38. Our analysis supporting this finding presents what we examined and discusses the following topic:
39. This finding matters because understanding the risks of climate change enables the Government of Nunavut to prioritize the steps it needs to take to ensure that Nunavut is resilient to the impacts of climate change. It also helps identify what steps need to be taken to ensure government services (such as the annual resupply of fuel to communities) and infrastructure (such as airports, health centres, and schools) are resilient to climate change. Identifying areas in communities at risk due to changes in permafrost helps local governments avoid developing in these areas.
40. Our recommendation in this area of examination appears at paragraph 49.
41. What we examined. We examined whether the Government of Nunavut had assessed the risks of climate change, including their impact and how likely they were to occur.
42. Assessing climate change risks. We found that the Government of Nunavut’s adaptation strategy identified the potential risks that climate change poses to Nunavut, including the potential impacts on current and future generations. However, it had not analyzed or ranked these risks in terms of their impacts and the likelihood that they would occur, nor had it assessed which communities and regions could be most affected by climate change.
43. The five-year draft action plan that was prepared for Nunavut’s adaptation strategy contained several proposed actions designed to better understand the risks of climate change, including the following to be led by the Department of Environment:
- assessing the risks of climate change to the government;
- developing tools to assess the costs and benefits of taking actions to adapt to climate change and the costs—environmental, economic, and social—of not acting; and
- identifying the impacts of climate change to biodiversity, including on hunting and traditional ways of life.
44. These are important steps to take to better understand the risks of climate change; however, we found that the Department of Environment did not follow through on these actions. Department officials noted difficulties in weighing and ranking one impact against another as a challenge to assessing risks.
45. We found that risks for selected topics were assessed. An assessment of climate change risks to Nunavut’s mining sector, including to infrastructure such as access roads, airstrips, and tailings (mining waste) facilities, was produced for the Department of Environment and other organizations. The Department also began to develop guidance for its staff on how to consider climate change during their reviews of environmental impact assessments of proposed projects. Climate change considerations could include the project’s greenhouse gas emissions and the potential impact of climate change on the proposed project.
46. We found that the Department of Community and Government Services, with support from the Department of Environment and other organizations, conducted a terrain mapping project to inform community planning and help identify areas unsuitable for development. The project produced maps for seven communities (Arviat, Baker Lake, Cape Dorset, Gjoa Haven, Kimmirut, Kugluktuk, and Pangnirtung). These maps identified areas at risk of instability due to changes in permafrost and other hazards, such as proximity to a body of water.
47. We also found that an assessment of the risks to primary sources of drinking water was prepared in 2017 for the Department of Community and Government Services and the Department of Health (Exhibit 2).
Exhibit 2—Primary sources of drinking water in some of Nunavut’s communities were identified as high risk
In 2017, a desktop risk assessment of primary sources of drinking water in Nunavut's communities (outside of Iqaluit) was completed for the Department of Community and Government Services and the Department of Health. The assessment considered a number of factors, including the size of the community's watershed, population growth, and future climate scenarios. The assessment identified six communities at high risk of water scarcity between 2016 and 2040, as a result of their watershed sizes, of growing water demands, and of climate change: Cambridge Bay, Cape Dorset, Clyde River, Igloolik, Rankin Inlet, and Taloyoak. According to Department of Community and Government Services officials, the results of the assessment were being used to determine next steps, including onsite research.
48. Finally, we found that the Department of Environment acted to increase awareness of the risks of climate change. It created the Nunavut Climate Change Centre, a web-based climate change resource to provide climate change information to Nunavummiut. The website includes an online database of information about permafrost. The Department also provided training to government officials on climate change.
49. Recommendation. The Department of Environment’s Climate Change Secretariat, in collaboration with other Government of Nunavut organizations, should analyze and rank the risks of climate change to Nunavut on the basis of their potential impacts and how likely they are to occur. Results of this analysis should be used to inform future climate change priorities and actions.
The Department of Environment’s response. Agreed. The Department of Environment intends to work with other Government of Nunavut organizations and external bodies to identify and rank climate change risks and hazards to Nunavut.
The Department of Environment will host a pan-northern meeting in March 2018 on permafrost hazard mapping. This will bring northern communities and government decision makers together to determine risks, opportunities, and recommendations to better manage and respond to permafrost thaw and other climate change risks. Best practices and lessons learned from this session will help inform future work conducted to address other identified risks. Additional work is scheduled to begin the development of climate change risk mitigation criteria for decision makers.
Taking action
Overall message
50. Overall, we found that the Department of Community and Government Services and the Nunavut Housing Corporation had measures to help protect buildings from the impacts of climate change on permafrost, but these measures were not fully implemented. These organizations and the Qulliq Energy Corporation did take steps to improve the energy efficiency of government assets, including government buildings in Iqaluit, public housing units, and power plants. However, the use of renewable energy, such as solar and wind, was limited due in part to high capital costs.
51. These findings matter because infrastructure can be protected from the impacts of climate change. Designing buildings with the potential impacts of climate change on permafrost in mind and assessing existing buildings and other infrastructure for potential problems from changing permafrost can reduce the risk of damage and the need for costly repairs. A government that owns energy-efficient assets and uses renewable energy sources can help reduce the demand for and dependence on fossil fuels, and the emissions of greenhouse gases. This can also support the government’s vision of self-reliant Nunavummiut and of Qanuqtuurniq—the Inuit societal value of being innovative and resourceful.
52. Climate change has caused air and ground temperatures in Canada’s north to increase, causing permafrost to warm. As permafrost warms, the ground can thaw, causing it to settle. Increased ground temperatures can also cause the active layer—the top layer of ground that freezes and thaws in permafrost zones—to deepen, increasing upward ground movement due to frost heave.
53. When ground settles and frost heave occurs, buildings on permafrost, such as schools, health centres, and public housing units, can shift and suffer distress or damage. This can include cracks in foundations and walls, uneven floors, doors and windows that do not close or seal properly, and leaks from supply or sewage lines, all of which can require repairs.
54. According to data collected by Natural Resources Canada at selected sites across Nunavut, permafrost temperatures increased between 2008 and 2014. With increased temperatures projected to occur because of climate change, warming of permafrost is expected to continue.
55. Putting skirting or piling snow around foundations can also degrade and thaw permafrost, because it insulates permafrost from cold air and allows the heat from the building to warm the permafrost below. Water that pools around buildings due to poor drainage or melting snow can also cause permafrost to degrade.
56. Canadian standards and technical guidance outline measures that can be taken to protect infrastructure from the impacts of degrading and thawing permafrost. These include the National Standard of Canada for Geotechnical Site Investigations for Building Foundations in Permafrost Zones (2017); the National Standard of Canada for Moderating the Effects of Permafrost Degradation on Existing Building Foundations (2014); and the Technical Guide—Infrastructure in Permafrost: A Guideline for Climate Change Adaptation (2010). These measures involve
- conducting geotechnical site investigations of planned building sites, which consider permafrost conditions and projected changes due to climate change (done before construction, these investigations are used to inform the design of foundations that are appropriate for the building site and are resilient to the impacts of climate change on permafrost over the life of the structure); and
- periodically inspecting and assessing buildings for signs of distress or damage due to ground settlement, frost heave, and permafrost degradation, and taking appropriate measures to avoid future damage, such as adjusting or levelling foundations.
57. Once the thawing of permafrost begins, stopping it is usually difficult and expensive. Therefore, it is essential to help preserve permafrost both beneath and beside a building. This can be achieved by implementing measures such as
- properly managing snow and drainage around buildings to avoid water from pooling (Exhibit 3), and
- ensuring spaces underneath buildings are properly ventilated to prevent permafrost from warming.
Exhibit 3—Ensuring proper drainage around facilities, such as the Leo Ussak School in Rankin Inlet, can help avoid water from pooling and reduce the risk of permafrost degradation

We found that the Department of Community and Government Services and the Nunavut Housing Corporation collected information on permafrost conditions through geotechnical site investigations to inform the design of their buildings and other infrastructure. Climate projections were considered in most of the cases we examined. We also found that both organizations did not always carry out building assessments as scheduled, which can help identify potential problems caused by changes in permafrost. Finally, we found that both organizations did not consistently incorporate measures into their operations and maintenance procedures for managing snow and water around buildings that could help prevent permafrost degradation.
59. Our analysis supporting this finding presents what we examined and discusses the following topics:
60. This finding matters because having measures in place to safeguard Nunavut’s buildings from changing permafrost conditions can prevent damage from occurring. Considering climate projections when conducting geotechnical site investigations helps ensure that building foundations are resilient to the potential impacts of climate change on permafrost. Periodically assessing existing buildings and proactively managing water and snow can help minimize and avoid damage and related repairs that can occur due to permafrost degradation and thaw.
61. Our recommendations in this area of examination appear at paragraphs 64, 71, 72, and 74.
62. What we examined. We examined whether the Department of Community and Government Services and the Nunavut Housing Corporation had
- conducted geotechnical site investigations for selected projects (seven infrastructure projects built by the Department of Community and Government Services and nine public housing units built by the Nunavut Housing Corporation) and considered climate projections in these investigations;
- assessed buildings (such as schools, health centres, and housing units) for signs of damage from thawing permafrost; and
- developed procedures to manage water and snow around their facilities to avoid permafrost degradation.
63. Geotechnical site investigations. We found that both the Department of Community and Government Services and the Nunavut Housing Corporation conducted geotechnical site investigations or used geotechnical information to inform the design and construction of infrastructure on permafrost. Climate projections were considered in six of the seven investigations conducted by the Department and five of the nine investigations conducted by the Corporation. Incorporating this type of information is important for ensuring that building foundations and other infrastructure are resilient to climate change.
64. Recommendation. The Department of Community and Government Services and the Nunavut Housing Corporation should ensure that climate change projections are incorporated into geotechnical site investigations where required.
The Department of Community and Government Services’ response. Agreed. The Department of Community and Government Services will initiate measures to ensure that climate change projections are incorporated into the geotechnical site investigations where required going forward.
The Nunavut Housing Corporation’s response. Agreed. The Nunavut Housing Corporation will incorporate climate change predictions into future geotechnical studies, where necessary.
65. Building assessments. We found that both the Department of Community and Government Services and the Nunavut Housing Corporation had procedures for assessing those parts of buildings, such as foundations, that could be affected by permafrost settlement and degradation. However, these assessments were not always carried out as scheduled. As a result, the Department and the Corporation may have missed signs of distress being caused by changing permafrost conditions and may have delayed steps that could have been taken to avoid or reduce damage.
66. The Department of Community and Government Services officials indicated that the Department conducts semi-annual and five-year building condition assessments as part of the management of its buildings. These assessments cover a range of building components, such as windows, ceilings, foundations, and pads that could be affected by changing permafrost conditions. The Regional Director, Infrastructure, is responsible for the semi-annual assessments, while the Department’s Technical Services is responsible for the more detailed five-year assessments.
67. Department officials indicated that semi-annual assessments were often done annually due to a lack of resources and to weather-related problems. According to documentation provided by the Department, semi-annual or annual assessments were done from October 2015 to October 2017 for buildings in the Kivalliq and Qikiqtaaluk regions except in Iqaluit and Rankin Inlet, where the buildings were not assessed. Government buildings under the Department’s responsibility were assessed in the Kitikmeot Region only in 2017. Buildings in Cambridge Bay were not assessed from October 2015 to October 2017. We found that the level of detail in the assessment reports that were completed varied; the assessments also did not always follow a standardized template, which could have helped ensure that all relevant aspects of a building, including structural aspects, were considered.
68. For detailed assessments, we found that a third party did five-year building condition assessments of government buildings in 2012. Since then, the Department put a new process in place requiring that a minimum number of buildings undergo a detailed assessment every year and that all assets be covered within a five-year period. We found, on the basis of data it provided, that the Department had completed detailed assessments for the buildings under its responsibility in 12 of Nunavut’s 25 communities at the end of October 2017. The Department planned to assess the remaining buildings by the end of 2019. As a result, buildings in selected communities will have gone up to almost seven years without a detailed assessment.
69. We also found that the Department required annual inspections of thermosyphons (a system used to keep a foundation and surrounding permafrost cold). We found that the inspection procedure for thermosyphons was not integrated into the electronic system used by the Department to manage its maintenance activities. As a result, these inspections were not taking place. During our audit, the Department took steps to address this issue. According to the Department, at least 3 of the 13 systems under its responsibility had experienced problems.
70. For the Nunavut Housing Corporation, we found that it required that its buildings undergo detailed condition rating assessments every two years. These assessments follow a standardized template that covers structural issues, such as building foundations that could be affected by changes to permafrost. We found, on the basis of data provided by the Corporation, that fewer than half (about 43%) of its public housing units underwent a condition rating assessment between October 2015 and October 2017. We noted that to strengthen its maintenance practices, the Corporation had recently increased the number of staff in its Territorial Maintenance Division and was planning to introduce a new system for managing its condition rating assessments.
71. Recommendation. The Department of Community and Government Services should standardize its building assessment procedures and complete its building assessments according to its required schedule.
The Department of Community and Government Services’ response. Agreed. The Department of Community and Government Services will work with all internal organizations to standardize its building assessment procedures and complete building assessments of Government of Nunavut infrastructure in the year scheduled.
72. Recommendation. The Nunavut Housing Corporation should ensure that it completes its condition rating assessments according to its schedule.
The Nunavut Housing Corporation’s response. Agreed. The Nunavut Housing Corporation will work with its Local Housing Organizations to ensure building condition ratings are completed according to schedule. The Corporation expects to implement a new building-condition software system in the 2018–19 fiscal year.
73. Snow and water management. We found that the operations and maintenance procedures followed by the Department of Community and Government Services and the Nunavut Housing Corporation did not fully reflect practices recommended in Canadian standards for managing snow and water around buildings, which can help prevent permafrost degradation. Municipal governments play an important role in managing snow and drainage in their communities, including around government facilities. It will be important to involve them in any discussions regarding snow and water management.
74. Recommendation. The Department of Community and Government Services and the Nunavut Housing Corporation should develop best practices for managing snow and water to prevent permafrost degradation for their owned buildings and incorporate these practices into their operations and maintenance procedures. Where applicable, the two organizations should involve municipal governments in the discussions on snow and water management.
The Department of Community and Government Services’ response. Agreed. The Department of Community and Government Services will work with stakeholders, specifically the Nunavut Association of Municipalities, to educate and support the municipalities in the development and use of best practices for managing snow and water to prevent permafrost degradation of infrastructure objects.
The Nunavut Housing Corporation’s response. Agreed. The Nunavut Housing Corporation will work with the Department of Community and Government Services and municipalities to improve the management of drainage and snow accumulation issues.
Selected Government of Nunavut organizations took steps to improve the energy efficiency of some of their assets but faced barriers to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and Nunavut’s dependence on fossil fuels
75. We found that the Qulliq Energy Corporation, the Department of Community and Government Services, and the Nunavut Housing Corporation acted to improve the energy efficiency of some assets, including power plants, government buildings in Iqaluit, and new public housing units. The Qulliq Energy Corporation and the Department of Community and Government Services also had some small renewable energy projects in place. There were, however, barriers to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and Nunavut’s dependence on fossil fuels.
76. Our analysis supporting this finding presents what we examined and discusses the following topics:
- Qulliq Energy Corporation
- Nunavut Housing Corporation
- Department of Community and Government Services
77. This finding matters because improving the energy efficiency of government-owned assets (such as power plants and buildings) and getting power from renewable energy sources can help reduce Nunavut’s demand for fossil fuels and greenhouse gas emissions.
78. Our recommendations in this area of examination appear at paragraphs 91, 99, 100, and 105.
79. What we examined. We examined whether the Qulliq Energy Corporation, the Department of Community and Government Services, and the Nunavut Housing Corporation took steps to improve energy efficiency and were using renewable energy to reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. We did not audit the costs and benefits associated with the various projects discussed in this section.
80. Qulliq Energy Corporation. The Qulliq Energy Corporation supplies electricity to each of Nunavut’s 25 communities through stand-alone diesel power plants and community distribution grids. In the 2015 to 2016 fiscal year, the Corporation established a goal to reduce its dependence on fossil fuels by 2% by 2019. The Corporation told us that it would achieve this through improved fuel efficiency.
81. We found that the Corporation replaced or upgraded several of its power plants and was maintaining and operating them more efficiently. According to the Corporation’s data, although its consumption of diesel fuel increased between the 2012 to 2013 and 2015 to 2016 fiscal years, the Corporation was producing more power per litre of diesel, a sign that the fuel efficiency of its power plants had improved.
82. The Corporation was also operating district heating systems. These systems capture residual heat generated through electricity production at power plants and distribute the heat to customers for heating buildings. Using residual heat helps reduce the use of heating fuels and the emissions of greenhouse gases.
83. We found that although there was infrastructure for these systems in 9 communities, the Corporation was supplying heat to customers in only 4—Iqaluit, Rankin Inlet, Arviat, and Kugluktuk. The system in Pangnirtung was temporarily not operating due to a fire at the community’s power plant. The other systems were no longer operating, but according to the Corporation, documentation on why was incomplete. The Corporation’s data showed that between January 2014 and December 2016, the four operating systems had on average
- reduced customer demand for heating fuels (and reduced associated greenhouse gas emissions) by an estimated 2 million litres annually, and
- generated about $1.8 million per year in revenues.
84. According to the Corporation, district heating systems can be costly to build and upgrade, and these costs were a barrier to further enhancing and expanding these systems in Nunavut. The Corporation was exploring federal funding opportunities to help overcome this barrier.
85. We also found that the Corporation had taken steps toward using renewable energy (Exhibit 4).
Exhibit 4—The Qulliq Energy Corporation was investigating the use of renewable energy
Solar power. In 2016, the Qulliq Energy Corporation installed a small demonstration project on solar energy at its Iqaluit power plant. According to the Corporation, the project improved its knowledge of how solar panels perform in the Arctic. In 2017, the Corporation assessed the costs and benefits of installing a 500-kilowatt solar energy project in Iqaluit. The project was estimated to cost almost $7.5 million and to reduce fuel consumption by an estimated 196,000 litres per year and greenhouse gas emissions by an estimated 615 tonnes per year.
Wind power. In 2016, a study produced for the Qulliq Energy Corporation identified five communities with the highest potential for harnessing wind resources (Arviat, Baker Lake, Iqaluit, Rankin Inlet, and Sanikiluaq). The study estimated that wind turbines could displace diesel use by about 18% to 56% in these communities and would cost about $4.2 million to $68.8 million to install.
Hydroelectric power. The Corporation investigated using hydroelectric power in Iqaluit, which, according to the Corporation, could reduce the Corporation’s annual fuel consumption by up to an estimated 30% and provide a meaningful reduction in the territory’s greenhouse gas emissions. Hydro generators are also less expensive to maintain than their diesel counterparts. In the 2013 to 2014 fiscal year, the initiative was suspended in part due to the large capital investment required (over $350 million in 2013).
86. We found that the Corporation was planning to implement a net-metering program that would encourage small-scale renewable energy projects. Under the program, customers who generate electricity (for example, using solar panels) can send unused power to the Corporation and receive a credit. By using renewable energy, customers reduce their demand for fossil fuels, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and save energy costs. The program was still being finalized at the time of our audit.
87. According to the Corporation, there were a number of barriers to large-scale renewable energy projects:
- high capital costs, including the cost of batteries to store power;
- the need to replace or upgrade aging power plants in 13 communities, which limited the Corporation’s capacity to invest in other areas;
- technical challenges, such as the icing of wind turbine blades; and
- the need to ensure that local power plants and transmission grids remain stable when receiving intermittent energy generated by third parties using renewable energy.
88. We found that the Corporation was taking steps to overcome the capital cost of large renewable energy projects by considering federal funding opportunities and third-party financing and operation of these projects.
89. We also found that the Corporation was working to have the Qulliq Energy Corporation Act amended so that it could purchase power from third parties. It was also developing an independent power producers policy, which would outline to third parties how the Corporation would integrate power from them. The Corporation identified the end of 2018 as a timeline for completing these actions.
90. We found that the Corporation reported the fuel efficiency of its diesel power plants annually; however, it did not compare it with past performance, making it difficult to interpret trends. We also found that the Corporation did not set targets on using alternative energy, such as how many litres of diesel it wants to reduce by using renewable energy, or the proportion of total energy it wants to generate using alternative sources. It would be important to have such targets to assess the Corporation’s performance and to frame its approach to renewable energy. In addition, although the Corporation had investigated a number of different renewable energy options, it had not identified which initiatives will be priorities.
91. Recommendation. The Qulliq Energy Corporation should establish priorities and targets for renewable energy (such as what share of its energy production it wants to come from renewable energy). Targets should have a baseline and timelines against which the Corporation can measure performance. Future reporting by the Corporation should include its progress on its priorities and performance against targets.
The Qulliq Energy Corporation’s response. Agreed. The Qulliq Energy Corporation will consult with the Government of Nunavut to determine the territory’s renewable energy objectives. Following the consultation phase, the Corporation will review territorial objectives within the context of the Corporation’s unique operating environment; set the appropriate priorities, targets, and timelines; and report accordingly. The Corporation anticipates that the deployment of renewable energy technology will be impacted by the Corporation’s small rate base, along with financial, geographical, and technical challenges. These factors will need to be reconciled with the Corporation’s primary objective of delivering reliable and affordable energy in an Arctic setting.
92. Nunavut Housing Corporation. We examined measures the Nunavut Housing Corporation took to improve the energy efficiency of new public housing units. We found that the Corporation had installed energy-efficient lighting, appliances, and boilers into its new public housing units. It had also included improved insulation and energy-efficient windows in its new units to make them airtight and reduce heat loss. According to the results of a desktop evaluation, these new units exceeded the energy-efficiency requirements of the National Building Code of Canada. Although the Corporation did not have any renewable energy projects, it had plans to install a small-scale solar panel project in Baker Lake to understand its potential energy performance and maintenance requirements.
93. According to an analysis done by the Corporation, selected housing units built between 2006 and 2012 used from 10 to 13% less fuel (savings of about $600 in fuel costs) per unit per year compared with older units built in the 1980s and 1990s. However, the Corporation’s data indicated that per-unit costs for fuel and electricity increased between the 2011 to 2012 and 2016 to 2017 fiscal years.
94. We found that the Corporation did not have information on how the efficiency measures it introduced had performed. In 2017, the Corporation hired a financial analyst to analyze its fuel and electricity use, including consumption trends. According to the Corporation, an Energy Initiatives Coordinator position was created in 2015 to ensure that energy efficiency was maintained and improved for public housing units. However, the position was not filled.
95. We found that the Corporation did not set targets for reducing fuel and electricity use, nor did it report on trends in its fuel and electricity use. Setting a target and reporting on trends is important for assessing the impact that the Corporation’s energy-efficiency measures are having.
96. We also examined the Corporation’s maintenance of heat recovery ventilators (HRVs) in its public housing units. Because energy-efficient homes are designed to be airtight, with limited air circulation, HRVs are used to replace indoor air with fresh outdoor air. They help ensure good indoor air quality, control humidity, and avoid moisture build up, which can contribute to mold.
97. The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation commissioned a study on HRVs in northern Canada. Released in 2017, the study identified problems with installing, operating, and maintaining HRVs. These issues, along with the lack of HRVs in some housing units, were identified as potential reasons behind the presence of mold in some of the Nunavut Housing Corporation’s public housing units.
98. According to the Nunavut Housing Corporation, it has HRV units in 2,181 of its public housing units across the territory and requires all new public units to have HRVs. We found that it was not carrying out maintenance of its HRVs as required by its procedures. According to the Corporation’s data, 18% of the HRVs in its public housing units received required annual inspections and servicing during the 2016 to 2017 fiscal year. In 15 communities, none of the HRVs received annual maintenance. We noted that the Corporation was assessing options on how to improve its inspection and maintenance of HRVs.
99. Recommendation. The Nunavut Housing Corporation should set targets for fuel and electricity savings. Future reporting should include how fuel and electricity use has changed over time and discuss how the Corporation performed against its targets.
The Nunavut’s Housing Corporation’s response. Agreed. The Nunavut Housing Corporation plans to evaluate fuel and electrical consumption to identify areas offering potential savings based on any available funding specifically allocated for energy retrofits. Targets and future reporting will be informed by the results of this work, with the understanding that prioritization of this work will be dependent on Government of Nunavut mandates and the direction of the Corporation’s Board of Directors. The Corporation will comply with codes related to building design and energy efficiency in a northern climate.
100. Recommendation. The Nunavut Housing Corporation should take appropriate steps to ensure that heat recovery ventilators (HRVs) are maintained as required under its maintenance program.
The Nunavut Housing Corporation’s response. Agreed. The Nunavut Housing Corporation will ensure maintenance programs related to heat recovery ventilators (HRVs) are implemented according to schedule.
101. Department of Community and Government Services. We examined the Nunavut Energy Management Program of the Department of Community and Government Services. The program uses private-sector firms to conduct energy retrofits to government buildings, using future energy savings to repay the cost of the retrofits. The program set two objectives: a 20% reduction in energy consumption and an associated reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.
102. The program began in the 2008 to 2009 fiscal year with a pilot project in Iqaluit to retrofit 37 Government of Nunavut buildings. This included replacing existing interior and exterior lighting with new energy-efficient lights and fixtures; and installing heat-recovery systems, solar hot-water heating systems (Exhibit 5), and solar walls for air pre-heating.

103. According to the Department, the Iqaluit project cost $12.8 million and led to more than $1.8 million per year in savings in utility costs (including water, fuel, and electricity). It also reduced greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 2,090 tonnes per year. In mid-2017, the Department received approval to expand the program to the Kivalliq Region.
104. We found that the Department of Community and Government Services reported on the Iqaluit pilot project on its website. However, its reporting on the project’s costs and energy savings did not reflect current internal data and did not include reporting on estimated greenhouse gas reductions.
105. Recommendation. The Department of Community and Government Services should ensure that its public reporting on the Nunavut Energy Management Program is up to date.
The Department of Community and Government Services’ response. Agreed. The Department of Community and Government Services will endeavour to ensure that information pertaining to the Nunavut Energy Management Program is up to date on the Department’s website.
Conclusion
106. We concluded that the Government of Nunavut had a strategy for adapting to climate change, which considered potential changes and impacts on current and future generations. The government also had an energy strategy, which included policy actions aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. However, both strategies lacked plans that outlined how the strategies would be implemented and who would be responsible for what. The government had also not fully assessed the risks of climate change to Nunavut.
107. We also concluded that selected Government of Nunavut organizations had measures to safeguard government buildings from the impacts of climate change on permafrost, but these measures were not fully implemented. Selected government organizations took steps to make government assets more energy efficient. However, there were a number of barriers to implementing alternatives to fossil fuels, which would help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the territory’s reliance on fossil fuels.
About the Audit
This independent assurance report was prepared by the Office of the Auditor General of Canada on the response to climate change in Nunavut by the Department of Environment, the Department of Community and Government Services, the Nunavut Housing Corporation, and the Qulliq Energy Corporation. Our responsibility was to provide objective information, advice, and assurance to assist the Legislative Assembly in its scrutiny of the government’s management of resources and programs, and to conclude on whether selected departments’ implementation of climate change measures complied in all significant respects with the applicable criteria.
All work in this audit was performed to a reasonable level of assurance in accordance with the Canadian Standard for Assurance Engagements (CSAE) 3001—Direct Engagements set out by the Chartered Professional Accountants of Canada (CPA Canada) in the CPA Canada Handbook—Assurance.
The Office applies Canadian Standard on Quality Control 1 and, accordingly, maintains a comprehensive system of quality control, including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards, and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.
In conducting the audit work, we have complied with the independence and other ethical requirements of the relevant rules of professional conduct applicable to the practice of public accounting in Canada, which are founded on fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care, confidentiality, and professional behaviour.
In accordance with our regular audit process, we obtained the following from entity management:
- confirmation of management’s responsibility for the subject under audit;
- acknowledgement of the suitability of the criteria used in the audit;
- confirmation that all known information that has been requested, or that could affect the findings or audit conclusion, has been provided; and
- confirmation that the audit report is factually based.
Audit objective
The objective of this audit was to determine whether selected Government of Nunavut organizations took measures to reduce the territory’s emissions of greenhouse gases and to adapt to climate change impacts, taking into account these impacts on current and future generations.
Scope and approach
In the 2016 to 2017 fiscal year, many legislative audit offices across Canada decided to look at the issue of climate change and developed similar audit approaches and questions to examine climate change action within their governments. As part of this initiative, the Office of the Auditor General of Canada decided to do climate change audits of all territories.
We examined whether the Government of Nunavut had a strategy and action plan in place for adapting to climate change and reducing greenhouse gas emissions; whether it was monitoring and reporting on progress made in implementing its strategy; and whether it had assessed the risks of climate change. This part of the audit focused primarily on the Department of Environment.
We also examined specific measures that the Department of Community and Government Services, the Nunavut Housing Corporation, and the Qulliq Energy Corporation took to reduce Nunavut’s greenhouse gas emissions and its dependence on fossil fuels, through energy-efficiency improvements and renewable energy initiatives.
We also examined specific adaptation efforts of the Department of Community and Government Services, and the Nunavut Housing Corporation. In particular, we examined whether permafrost changes that can occur due to climate change were considered to inform the design of infrastructure and during the assessment of buildings (for example, schools, health centres, and housing units).
The audit involved reviewing and analyzing documents, interviews, and site visits. Department officials were interviewed as well as community stakeholders and representatives of local governments. We conducted field work in Iqaluit and in a select number of communities.
We did not examine the role of other Government of Nunavut departments, such as the Department of Finance, the Department of Executive and Intergovernmental Affairs, and the Department of Economic Development and Transportation, or municipal governments.

2019 June Report of the Auditor General of Canada to the Legislative Assembly of NunavutSupport for High School Students and Adult Learners
Independent Auditor’s Report
Introduction
Background
1. The Government of Nunavut has made it a priority to provide education and training that prepare children, youth, and adult learners for positive contributions to society and for meaningful employment. For the government, providing good education and training opportunities is key to a healthy, strong, and flourishing Nunavut.
2. At the start of the 2018–2019 school year, there were almost 2,800 high school students (grades 10 to 12) in Nunavut. Preparing them academically and providing them with guidance and support, along with hands-on learning experiences, can help them successfully transition through school to post-secondary education or the workforce. Access to adult education programs is important for adult learners who want to further their education. These can include individuals who want to upgrade their academic and literacy skills, get their high school diplomas, or pursue post-secondary education.
3. In addition to building a healthy and strong Nunavut, increasing the number of Inuit with high school diplomas or post-secondary education would help the Government of Nunavut meet its obligations under the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement. Under Article 23 of the agreement, the Government of Nunavut is required to increase Inuit participation in government employment to a representative level of 85%. As of 30 September 2018, Inuit made up about 50% of the Government of Nunavut’s 3,500 employees; almost 1,500 additional positions were vacant. Typically, these vacant positions required at least a high school diploma or some form of post-secondary education. Increasing the number of Inuit with high school diplomas or post-secondary education would increase the number of Inuit candidates for these jobs, and for other jobs in the public and private sectors.
4. Department of Education. The Department of Education is responsible for programs and services that support early childhood education and the Kindergarten to Grade 12 school system. The Department is also responsible for guiding the development of governance, policy, and strategic planning for adult learning in the territory. This responsibility includes programs that support equality of opportunity and encourage adult literacy, numeracy, and essential employability skills. The Department’s vision is to have more well-educated and self-reliant Nunavummiut, high school graduation rates that are on par with the rest of Canada, and a majority of Nunavut youth graduating from high school, college, or university, with the same level of skills and abilities as graduates from anywhere in Canada.
5. The Department operates 44 schools across Nunavut, with high school offered in all 25 communities. Its budget for the 2018–19 fiscal year was $213 million. In the 2018–2019 school year, 10,814 students were enrolled in school. The Department works with locally elected district education authorities to administer schools and oversee aspects of school programs.
6. Nunavut Arctic College. The only post-secondary institution in Nunavut, the College offers a variety of college- and university-level certificate, diploma, and degree programs and adult basic education and job-readiness programs. It also offers college preparatory programs for individuals who lack the academic requirements to be accepted into the college’s post-secondary programs, such as nursing, teaching, and environmental technologies. The College’s programs are offered through campuses in Iqaluit, Rankin Inlet, and Cambridge Bay, and through community learning centres across Nunavut. The College also has an Inuit Cultural Learning Facility (Piqqusilirivvik) in Clyde River, with programs offered in Baker Lake and Igloolik. It also runs the Nunavut Innovation and Research Institute in Iqaluit, with programs offered in Pond Inlet.
7. Department of Family Services. The Department of Family Services manages and delivers the territory’s financial aid programs for adult learners:
- Financial Assistance for Nunavut Students (FANS), which provides grants, loans, and scholarships to students enrolled in post-secondary education; and
- Adult Learning and Training Supports (ALTS), which provides grants to learners taking non–post-secondary employment training programs.
Focus of the audit
8. This audit focused on whether the Department of Education, Nunavut Arctic College, and the Department of Family Services adequately supported youth and adult learners’ transition from high school to post-secondary education and employment.
9. This audit is important because education is important to the well-being of individuals and Nunavut as a whole. Well-educated citizens are more likely to be productive, healthy, participating members of society and communities. Citizens whose education is limited face fewer opportunities for jobs and civic participation. As a result, it is critical that the education system work well for all students, including high school students and adult learners who want to further their education.
10. At the time of our audit, the Government of Nunavut was reviewing the Education Act. We did not audit the review process or areas where legislative changes may be possible. We also did not examine training programs funded by the federal government or activities of district education authorities.
11. More details about the audit objective, scope, approach, and criteria are in About the Audit at the end of this report.
Findings, Recommendations, and Responses
Overall message
12. Overall, we found that Nunavut’s education system had a number of gaps and barriers that made it difficult for high school students and adult learners to succeed academically and transition to post-secondary education and employment. Many high school students needed more than one year to complete a grade, which extended the time required to complete high school, with many leaving school before graduating. Addressing the challenges faced by high school students requires contributions from many stakeholders. However, we found that the Department of Education did not have a strategy that outlined actions it and other partners could take to help students graduate and transition from high school to post-secondary education and employment. Furthermore, despite difficulties hiring and keeping staff, the Department did not have a recruitment and retention strategy to address its human resource needs.
13. Only two of the seven high schools we examined had teachers assigned to help students navigate the challenging path to post-secondary education and employment. Students were being offered hands-on learning experiences, but few had work placements or cooperative opportunities that could be used to expose them to workplaces and occupations. Moreover, the territory’s sole post-secondary institution, Nunavut Arctic College, undertook only limited outreach to inform high school students of its programs, and program information on its website was out of date.
14. We also found that adult learners who wanted to upgrade their literacy and other academic skills faced barriers. For example, to enrol in the territory’s online adult high school diploma program, learners needed to have minimum literacy skills, which more than one third of applicants lacked. Yet the adult basic education program that allowed adult learners to improve their literacy skills and become eligible for the online diploma program was not offered in most Nunavut communities in the past five years.
15. According to Nunavut Arctic College, many applicants required academic upgrading to be eligible for its programs. We found that the College offered preparatory programs, but because of funding constraints, it could offer them in only a few communities. As a result, many adult learners would have to leave their communities to access these programs. Access to the territory’s financial aid programs for selected adult learners was limited. For example, financial aid was not available to adult learners taking part-time programs, adults taking high school courses, and learners taking most adult basic education courses. This limited access to financial aid could be a barrier for adult learners who wish to further their education.
High school students
The Department of Education did not prepare students for post-secondary education or employment
16. We found that the Department of Education was not doing enough to prepare students academically for post-secondary education or employment. Despite low graduation rates and many students leaving high school before graduating, we found that the Department did not have a strategy to help students graduate and transition from high school to post-secondary education or employment. Furthermore, the Department did not have a strategy to recruit and retain teachers, principals, and other key staff.
17. We found that aspects of the Department of Education high school curriculum related to career planning and development were not implemented consistently. While all of the seven schools we examined offered hands-on learning to students, only four schools had students prepare required career and program plans that were meant to help guide students through high school. We also found that Nunavut Arctic College’s efforts to inform students about its programs were limited.
18. Our analysis supporting this finding presents what we examined and discusses the following topics:
- Strategy to help students graduate and transition from high school to post-secondary education or employment
- Strategy to recruit and retain staff
- Student assessment
- Advanced courses and distance learning
- Counselling and advice on academic and career options
- Nunavut Arctic College’s school outreach
- Hands-on learning
19. This finding matters because helping students graduate and preparing them academically are important to achieving the Department of Education’s vision of having high school graduation rates on par with the rest of Canada and for most Nunavut youth to graduate from high school with the same skills and abilities as graduates from elsewhere in Canada. Providing guidance to students on academic and career paths makes them aware of their options and the importance of a high school diploma for finding a job. Assessing students tells them what their strengths are and where they need to improve and can be used to improve teaching methods. Hands-on learning exposes students to work environments and can help prepare them for the workforce. It also reflects the Inuit value Pilimmaksarniq/Pijariuqsarniq (developing skills through observation, mentoring, practice, and effort).
20. Nunavut high school students must obtain 100 credits and pass Grade 12 English to graduate. Grade 12 English involves taking the Government of Alberta’s standardized Grade 12 English exam. The final course mark is a combination of the mark assigned by the teacher based on classroom work (70%) and the mark obtained on the standardized exam (30%).
21. In our previous audit on education in Nunavut in 2013, we reported, among other things, that students’ classroom marks in Grade 12 English were 26 percentage points higher than the marks they received on standardized examinations. We recommended that the Department of Education analyze these differences to identify potential areas for reducing this gap.
22. The Department of Education’s curriculum for high school students includes career-related courses that provide students with hands-on learning experiences. The Department requires Grade 9 students to develop a personal career and program plan. The plan is intended to outline a student’s path through school to graduation and to be updated at least once a year. Preparing the plan helps students identify which courses are most relevant to their interests, abilities, and life goals, including post-secondary education.
23. Nunavut Arctic College offers several post-secondary programs, including nursing and teaching. Increasing the number of Inuit nurses and teachers is a priority of the Government of Nunavut. Increasing high school students’ awareness of these programs could encourage them to enter these occupations.
24. Our recommendations in this area of examination appear at paragraphs 31, 32, 38, 39, 44, 47, 52, 55, and 59.
25. What we examined. We examined whether the Department of Education had a strategy and policies to prepare high school students to transition to post-secondary education and employment. We examined whether students were receiving guidance and support on academic and career options, along with hands-on learning opportunities. We also examined Nunavut Arctic College’s outreach to high schools.
26. Strategy to help students graduate and transition from high school to post-secondary education or employment. We found that the Department of Education did not have a strategy that outlined actions it and other partners could take to help students graduate and transition from high school to post-secondary education and employment. Nor did the Department have any targets or timelines to support its vision of having high school graduation rates and graduates’ skills equal to those in the rest of Canada.
27. Several factors can make completing high school a challenge for Nunavummiut. Overcrowded housing, food insecurity, and the legacy of residential schools can affect students’ academic performance. Furthermore, studies have shown that a high percentage of school-aged Inuit children have hearing impairments that can delay language development and impede academic success. Addressing these challenges requires action not just by the Department of Education but also by others in the community (such as other Government of Nunavut departments, local stakeholders, and parents). Adequately supporting students before they enter high school is also important to their success.
28. We found that many high school students needed more than one year to complete a grade. According to the Department of Education’s data, for the three school years we examined (2015–2016 to 2017–2018), more than one third (39%) of students enrolled in grades 10, 11, or 12 had been enrolled in the same grade the year before. Of the students who enrolled in Grade 10 in the 2015–2016 school year, 22% graduated within three years (that is, by the end of the 2017–2018 school year). Of the students who enrolled in Grade 10 in the 2014–2015 school year, 29% graduated after four years. Many high school students also left school early. For example, between the 2015–2016 and 2017–2018 school years, the number of students who left grades 10, 11, or 12 before finishing their grade was 1,275 (equal to 16% of all students enrolled in these grades in that time period). Of those high school students who took more than one year to complete a grade, up to one third would leave school before finishing their grade.
29. At the time of our audit, there was one primary graduation pathway for students. School officials told us that alternative graduation pathways were needed to encourage students to stay in school. We found that the Department of Education was examining alternative diploma options that would better fit students’ needs and strengths, and would better describe what students had achieved. The Department had not set any clear direction or timelines for completing this work.
30. Teachers and principals identified low attendance at school as one of the root causes of students’ academic difficulties. The Department of Education also emphasized that a student’s attendance has a direct effect on their progress through high school. We found several problems with the completeness and accuracy of attendance data provided to us by the Department. Having good data on attendance is important for understanding the extent of the problem, identifying possible solutions, and determining the success of actions taken to improve attendance.
31. Recommendation. The Department of Education should develop and implement a strategy that specifies the actions that it and other partners will take to help students graduate from high school and transition to post-secondary education and employment.
The Department’s response. Agreed. In the 2019–20 fiscal year, the Department of Education will develop a 10-year strategic plan. Strategies to help students successfully graduate and transition from high school will be included within this plan. Project planning for this began in fall 2018.
In spring 2018, the Department staffed a new position, within the Advanced Education Division. The focus of this position is to support the transition of adult learners either from high school, post-secondary education, or the labour market.
32. Recommendation. The Department of Education should take steps to improve the quality of attendance data.
The Department’s response. Agreed. In 2012, the Department of Education began implementing the Student Information System (SIS) to standardize and improve the quality of student data that the Department can access. Data entry is generally done by school staff, with additional support provided remotely by divisional staff. The reliability and accuracy of data entry is impacted by staff vacancies and turnover.
The Department has developed and is implementing online training modules and system manuals for school office administrators, secretaries, and teachers, to ensure that all key users receive training on how to use, and enter data into, the SIS. This support helps to streamline the data-entry process and builds capacity within staff to ensure the overall quality of student data.
33. Strategy to recruit and retain staff. We found that the Department of Education did not have a recruitment and retention strategy to address its staffing needs and challenges, such as high turnover of teachers and principals. The Department told us that the high turnover of teachers increased principals’ and teachers’ workloads and affected the quality of students’ education.
34. There were also vacancies in branches within the Department that were responsible for supporting schools and the Department as a whole. For example, the Department’s data for the end of October 2018 showed the following:
- In the Educator Development division, 18 of 22 positions (82%) were vacant. This division’s responsibilities include training school staff on the Department’s directives, programs, and policies; improving teaching practices; and supporting students who need accommodations.
- In the Curriculum Development division, 12 of 21 positions (57%) were vacant. This limited the Department’s capacity to develop and update the curriculum. The curriculum for many courses had not been updated for more than 10 years or to reflect the Nunavut context.
35. Department officials said that several factors affected the Department’s ability to fill vacant positions, including the lack of housing, teachers and other staff not being a first priority when allocating staff housing, the need for teachers to share accommodations with others they may not know, a lengthy staffing process, and a low number of applicants for some positions.
36. To address its human resource needs, the Department commissioned two contractors in 2018 who were experienced former Department of Education employees to attend career fairs at Canadian universities to recruit teachers to work in Nunavut. The Department was also developing a new Nunavut Educator Development website and preparing a project charter to develop a long-term recruitment and retention strategy. However, the strategy focused on educators only, not other Department staff, such as those in the educator development or curriculum development divisions, and it had not identified timelines and resources for putting the strategy into action.
37. We found that the Department had a goal to increase Inuit representation within its workforce, but it did not have a strategy to encourage high school students to enrol in post-secondary programs that would lead to positions in the Department. However, it did indicate to us that it was planning communications activities aimed at encouraging students to pursue careers in education. Given that the majority of students in Nunavut are Inuit, a comprehensive strategy to promote their participation in the education workforce could help to address vacancies and turnover.
38. Recommendation. The Department of Education should develop and carry out a strategy to recruit and retain staff in schools and throughout the Department. The strategy should
- be based on a needs analysis,
- identify and address the conditions that discourage working as a teacher in Nunavut, and
- identify deliverables and related timelines and resources.
The Department should periodically assess the effectiveness of its strategy and take corrective action as required.
The Department’s response. Agreed. In the 2019–20 fiscal year, the Department of Education will develop a 10-year teacher retention and recruitment strategy. Project planning for this strategy development began in fall 2018.
39. Recommendation. The Department of Education should develop specific actions to encourage students to enrol in post-secondary education programs that would lead to positions in the Department.
The Department’s response. Agreed. The 10-year teacher retention and recruitment strategy being developed in the 2019–20 fiscal year will incorporate actions to encourage students to enrol in post-secondary programs that could lead to careers in the Department of Education.
The Department will assist students to explore a variety of possibilities for post-secondary training by entering into partnerships that will incorporate hands-on learning opportunities through practicums, work experience, job shadowing, and co-op learning. The Department supports Take Your Kids to Work Day.
40. Student assessment. We found that the Department of Education did not have finalized policies and guidelines to help teachers assess student achievement in the classroom. As a result, the Department did not have assurance that students were being assessed consistently across schools or that classroom marks were reliable. At the time of our audit, the Department had a draft assessment, evaluation, and reporting framework and related policy for Kindergarten to Grade 12 students. It was also planning to develop a handbook for teachers to help carry out the policy.
41. We found that the Department had begun assessing the literacy levels of students from Kindergarten to Grade 12. These tests were meant to help teachers determine a student’s reading level, inform teaching practices, and document a student’s reading progress over time.
42. In our 2013 audit, we analyzed the differences between the standardized departmental exams and classroom marks for Grade 12 English. We found that for the three school years we examined (2009–2010 to 2011–2012), the average classroom grade was 26 percentage points higher than the standardized test grades. For this audit, we again analyzed student performance on the standardized exam and compared it with the students’ classroom marks from the three most recent school years (2015–2016 to 2017–2018). We found that the gap had narrowed. Classroom grades were 20 percentage points higher on average than the standardized test grades.
43. As part of this audit, we followed up with the Department on the actions it had taken in response to our 2013 recommendation that it analyze the differences between the marks obtained by students in the classroom and on the standardized exam, to identify potential areas for reducing these differences. We found that the Department had not recently analyzed this information. As a result, it did not have the information it needed to inform decisions on improvements or changes it could make to teaching and student assessment methods. In 2013, the Department developed a draft directive that outlined the steps teachers and principals could take to reduce the gap between classroom marks and standardized exam marks. However, it did not complete the directive.
44. Recommendation. The Department of Education should complete its policies and guidelines on student assessment and implement them. It should also complete and implement the draft directive for school staff on the steps they can take to improve student performance and to further reduce the gap between classroom marks and end-of-year standardized exams.
The Department’s response. Agreed. The Department of Education’s student assessment and reporting policy, framework, and handbook aim to provide guidelines on how to assess students for success and achieve consistency and reliability in assessment practices across Nunavut schools.
The Department has a draft student assessment and reporting policy that is being reviewed following feedback from the Coalition of Nunavut District Education Authorities, which recommended that the Department revise the policy to further reflect Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit. The Department has commenced the reviewing process and the document will be ready for the 2020–2021 school year.
The Department will continue its efforts to reduce the gap between end-of-year standardized departmental exams and classroom marks for Grade 12 English.
Recognizing the connection between a responsive, welcoming, and safe learning environment and student achievement, the Department is working toward increasing the success rates in the standardized exams through the development of a safe and caring school framework. This framework aims to create a teaching and learning environment that promotes a sense of achievement among students and educators, thus leading to higher success rates.
Over the next two years, the Department intends to have data analysis systems in place so that policy decisions are informed by data.
The Department will also initiate the review process of the School Operations Directive: Review of Marks Differential Directive (2013).
45. Advanced courses and distance learning. We found that many schools did not offer advanced-level courses, such as advanced physics and chemistry. Reasons for not offering these courses were factors such as a lack of teachers and the small numbers of students wanting or academically ready to take these courses. Access to such courses is important for those students who want to qualify for selected post-secondary programs.
46. The Department of Education, through the Alberta Distance Learning Centre, offered distance learning to students who wanted to take advanced courses not offered in their schools. However, we found that the Department had no directive on distance learning in place that clarified the process students, parents, principals, and district education authorities had to follow to register students in distance learning courses. The Department was working on a draft distance-learning directive that would clarify this. The Department reported on its website that it was also developing a delivery plan for distance education. It was unable to confirm who was responsible for completing this task and when it would be completed.
47. Recommendation. The Department of Education should complete and implement its directive and its delivery plan on distance learning.
The Department’s response. Agreed. The Department of Education is finalizing the distance learning directive for students registered in Nunavut Kindergarten to Grade 12 schools for the 2019–2020 academic year. This directive clarifies the process for students, parents, principals, and district education authorities. It has simplified the process to access distance learning for parents and students.
The Department will make an effort to initiate the process of developing a delivery plan for distance learning through a collaborative process involving several divisions. The delivery plan will further support implementation.
48. Counselling and advice on academic and career options. We found that the Department of Education did not have formal guidance counsellor positions in its high schools. At the time of our audit, it was considering obtaining funding for these positions. Principals in two of the seven high schools we visited had assigned teachers to provide guidance and advice to students. When there was no guidance counsellor, principals, vice-principals, and teachers provided advice in addition to their regular responsibilities.
49. We found that the Department did not provide training to school staff on how to give students career advice and gave them few materials on topics such as post-secondary programs, financial assistance, and job opportunities. We also found that only four of the seven schools we visited had students prepare career and program plans. Guidance and career planning can help students ensure that they are aware of which high school courses they need to be eligible for post-secondary education programs that interest them. Without this information, students might not take the courses they need, delaying their entry into post-secondary education.
50. In some of the schools we examined, guest speakers came to talk about their jobs. Career fairs were also available to students. The Department also participated in Connected North, a program operated by TakingITGlobal, a registered charity that uses videoconferencing to connect students with mentors, experts, and other classrooms. Twelve of Nunavut’s 44 elementary and high schools have participated. There were plans to have a total of 20 schools participate by the end of the 2018–2019 school year. Skills Canada Nunavut, a non-governmental organization, also offered skills clubs and competitions to engage youth in the trade and technology sectors.
51. In 2018, the Department of Education created a three-person team responsible for career development programming and related curricula. One of the team’s first tasks was to review and modify the Department’s guidance and course offerings on career planning. By the end of the audit period, only the team lead position had been staffed.
52. Recommendation. The Department of Education should ensure that high school students are getting advice on academic and career options and that students complete career and program plans. The Department should also provide training and support materials to school staff on how to give students career advice.
The Department’s response. Agreed. The completion of the career and program planning process is mandatory at Grade 9 and embedded into Aulajaaqtut courses at grades 10 and 11. Schools that have undergone a high staff and administrative turnover may not be following the mandate. To assist schools to better support students in career exploration, course selection, and involving parents in these life choices, the Department of Education will work with Regional School Operations administrators to ensure that school administrators and staff are aware of the career program planning process and have accounted for this in their Long Range / Year Plans to undertake this process with their students. This data will be used to inform the school’s Education Program Plan (EPP).
The Department will complete the staffing for the Curriculum Development Division Transition Team, so that initiatives such as Take Your Kids to Work Day, career fairs, and links to preparing students for a successful life after high school are available to all students.
53. Nunavut Arctic College’s school outreach. We found that Nunavut Arctic College did not have an outreach strategy or a team dedicated to informing high school or other prospective students about its programs. Staff were responsible for promoting their own programs, but they told us that they had little time for outreach to high school students and infrequently visited schools.
54. We found several problems with the information that was publicly available about the College’s programs. For example, the last program calendar with detailed information on the College’s programs and admission requirements was dated 2012–2014. Furthermore, as at July 2018, information on the College’s website about program offerings, schedules, and application deadlines was for the 2016–2017 school year, not 2018–2019. At the time of our audit, the College was taking steps to improve outreach. It had hired a public affairs officer and sought additional funding for a dedicated recruitment team. It was also updating its website. However, at the end of the audit period, we continued to find many examples of information on academic requirements for College programs that was unclear or inaccurate. This would make it difficult for guidance counsellors, teachers, high school students, other prospective learners, and parents to confirm admission requirements.
55. Recommendation. Nunavut Arctic College should inform high school students about the various academic programs it offers and ensure that it keeps information on its programs and admission requirements clear and up to date.
The College’s response. Agreed. The Minister responsible for the Nunavut Arctic College and the Board of Governors have directed the College to see how it can begin to address these gaps. The College has recently begun to overhaul its website and has posted an updated program schedule for the 2019–2020 academic year. The maintenance of a digital presence for the purpose of communicating information with the public is an iterative process, and the College will continue to update and improve its website content for the purpose of providing current and clear information to the public. The College has received additional funding for these activities.
During the winter sitting of the Legislative Assembly (February–March 2019), additional base funding was appropriated for the College with the express purpose of creating a marketing, communications, and recruitment team. This team will include a divisional manager, promotional materials specialist, and two strategic recruitment coordinators. This funding will be available to the College on 1 April 2019, and the College is already preparing to fill those positions as soon as possible.
The College acknowledges that, due to the size of the territory, some marketing activities will need to remain with individual faculties, divisions, or frontline staff in the communities. As such, the additional expertise of the headquarter division along with the supplemental funding for marketing materials and activities is intended to augment existing activities and help build capacity where necessary, rather than completely centralizing recruitment operations.
The College recognizes the need to inform high school students and mature learners of the academic programs being offered in both the campus communities as well as the community learning centres, and is committed to improving how it communicates and markets its programs and course offerings to Nunavummiut.
56. Hands-on learning. We found that all seven high schools we visited offered courses that provided students with hands-on learning experiences in the classroom or on the land. These courses included
- traditional knowledge and activities, such as building igloos and kayaks, fishing, fox trapping, wilderness navigation, outdoor survival skills, cooking on fires, and sewing; and
- entrepreneurship, sustainable tourism, Photoshop, iMovie, hairstyling, esthetics, health services, nutrition and wellness, and cooking.
57. We found that only one of the seven schools we examined offered a pre-trades program. We did note hands-on learning initiatives that other schools and communities could adopt (Exhibit 1).
Exhibit 1—Several initiatives have provided students with hands-on learning
Pre-trades program. One of the seven schools we examined, Kugluktuk High School, offered a pre-trades program. The program combines hands-on learning, such as building kayaks or furniture, with academic-level studies, including mathematics—an important skill for students who wish to enter certain trades. As part of the program, students have visited mining operations in the Northwest Territories as well as the Northern Alberta Institute of Technology in Edmonton. According to the school, almost 75% of students in the program have graduated; many pursued post-secondary education or were employed in the trades. The pre-trades program was developed as part of the Department of Education’s Multiple Options initiative.
TASK week. In Baker Lake, high school students can participate in the Trades Awareness Skills and Knowledge (TASK) week. In 2018, students experienced trades such as plumbing, electrical, hairdressing, welding, mechanics, environmental testing, and culinary arts. TASK week involved Agnico Eagle Mines as well as Nunavut Arctic College. In fall 2018, students visited the local mine operated by Agnico Eagle.
Health Careers Camp. In February 2018, the Northern Ontario School of Medicine, the Qaujigiartiit Health Research Centre, and Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated collaborated with the Department of Health, the Department of Education, and Nunavut Arctic College to hold a one-week Health Careers Camp pilot project in Iqaluit. About 20 Nunavut high school students participated, representing all three regions of the territory. Students were given an opportunity to learn about health careers and develop hands-on clinical skills, such as putting on casts and suturing.
58. We found that of the seven schools we examined, two had students enrolled in work experience courses during each of the last three school years (2015–2016 to 2017–2018). In the other five schools, no students or very few students were enrolled in work experience courses. None of the schools we examined had cooperative work placements. The lack of work placements was partly due to schools lacking the resources to coordinate and manage arrangements with potential employers. We noted that beginning in 2016, the Department of Family Services started a summer work-experience program for youth returning to school in the fall. In 2017 and 2018, 54 high school and post-secondary students participated in the program.
59. Recommendation. The Department of Education should, in collaboration with other departments and partners, increase students’ access to opportunities for hands-on learning, including work placements or cooperative education options.
The Department’s response. Agreed. The Curriculum Development Division Transition Team in the Department of Education is tasked with increasing awareness of hands-on learning opportunities to staff, students, and parents. The Transition Team will engage partners to ensure that academic and experiential learning opportunities are tied to program planning, course selection, and career pathways.
The Transition Team and the Iqqaqqaukkaringiq Team will review the former Nunavut Early Apprenticeship Training (NEAT) program, to see whether an updated plan for high school students to begin apprenticeship training early can or should be implemented.
The Department is also considering how the Pathway to Adult Secondary School Graduation program (PASS) can incorporate work placements and cooperative education options.
Adult learners
Adult learners faced barriers to advancing their education
60. In Nunavut, most Inuit adults between the ages of 25 and 64 have not completed high school. According to Statistics Canada, in 2016, of Inuit in Nunavut aged 25 to 64, approximately
- 52% had not completed high school (the Canadian average was 11%),
- 15% had completed high school but not post-secondary education (the Canadian average was 24%), and
- 33% had completed some form of post-secondary education (the Canadian average was 65%).
Moreover, according to an international assessment of adult proficiency in literacy and numeracy conducted between 2011 and 2012, 83% of Nunavummiut aged 16 to 65 had literacy levels below what is needed for most tasks in society and the workplace. It is important to note that the assessment was conducted in English or French—neither of which was the mother tongue of most of the Inuit respondents.
61. In 2006, the Government of Nunavut and Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated released the Nunavut Adult Learning Strategy. The Strategy notes that the largest group of adult learners are those that need programming that focuses on literacy, life skills, completing high school or high school equivalent, and adult basic education. One of the Strategy’s objectives is to develop a flexible learning system that allows learners to enter and leave when they need to. Such a system would reflect the individual conditions and life paths of adult learners in Nunavut. The Department of Education and Nunavut Arctic College are responsible for implementing aspects of the Strategy.
62. Adult learners are diverse: Some may want to develop basic reading and writing skills; others may want to upgrade their academic skills so that they can pursue their high school diploma or be eligible for college or university programs. Nunavut Arctic College’s Adult Basic Education program focuses on core academic competencies (ABE-core). This program provides adult learners with curricula similar to what is available in the territory’s Kindergarten to Grade 12 program and covers English, Inuktitut, math, science, and social studies, among other subjects. It has six levels, ranging from the equivalent of grades 1 to 3, to Grade 12:
- Level 110—grades 1 to 3
- Level 120—grades 4 to 6
- Level 130—grades 7 to 9
- Level 140—grades 10 and 11
- Level 150—Grade 12 (general)
- Level 160—Grade 12 (advanced)
63. The College delivers the ABE-core program as well as various pre-employment training programs including Adult Basic Education–Essential Skills (ABE–Essential Skills). This program allows learners to develop the skills they need for entry-level or semi-skilled jobs in Nunavut. The program covers reading, writing, and numeracy skills; runs for two semesters in the daytime; and includes 90 hours of workplace experience. The College has received federal funding to deliver ABE–Essential Skills.
64. Some adults may be missing some or all of the credits they need to graduate from high school. Others who have graduated from high school may be missing prerequisite courses or may lack the academic skills needed to get into post-secondary programs. In those cases, it is important for learners to be able to access adult high school programs and college or university preparatory or qualifying programs.
65. In 2013, to help learners obtain their high school diplomas, the Department of Education and Nunavut Arctic College created the Pathway to Adult Secondary School Graduation program (PASS), a free online program of high school courses for adult learners. Adult learners can earn up to 35 high school credits through PASS. The program allows adult learners to work at their own pace and offers some core grade 11 and 12 subjects, including English, math, science, social studies, and Aulajaaqtut (which covers topics such as health and well-being).
66. According to the College, many applicants required an upgrading year to be eligible for its programs, because they lacked the marks, the required courses, and/or a high school diploma. To address this need, the College offered adult learners a variety of preparatory programs so that they could become eligible for and succeed in its degree, diploma, or trades programs. These programs included
- College Foundation, for learners who wished to become eligible for the College’s programs (as well as a program for students who wanted to enter the College’s teaching program);
- pre-nursing, for learners who wished to be eligible for the College’s nursing program; and
- pre-apprenticeship, for learners who wished to enter trades such as electrical, plumbing, or carpentry.
67. Nunavut Arctic College has admission requirements for its various programs. For example, learners must have
- English reading and writing and math skills at the mid-120 level (equivalent to Grade 5) to be eligible for ABE–Essential Skills,
- English reading and writing skills at the 140 level (equivalent to grades 10 and 11) to enter PASS,
- English reading and writing and math skills at the 130 level (equivalent to Grade 9) to enter the College Foundation program, or
- a high school diploma (with Grade 12 English and math) to enter the pre-nursing program.
Entrance requirements for its pre-apprenticeship programs vary. For example, to enter the Pre-Apprenticeship Electrician program, learners must have Level 130 in math and English reading and writing.
68. Learners may have to leave their communities or the territory to attend programs at the College or to pursue post-secondary education or skills training at other institutions. The costs of travel and accommodation can prevent learners from relocating to pursue their education or training.
69. We found that adult learners faced barriers to furthering their education. Over the past five school years, in most of Nunavut’s communities (17 of 25), Nunavut Arctic College did not offer its core Adult Basic Education (ABE-core) program for adult learners who wanted to develop their literacy and other academic skills. Lack of access to the ABE-core program can prevent adult learners from getting the skills they need to obtain their high school diplomas and/or enter trades or other post-secondary programs, including those offered by the College. In contrast, the College offered its Essential Skills program, which prepares learners for semi-skilled jobs, more frequently and in more communities. Learners were eligible for financial aid if they were taking work-related skills upgrading programs, such as ABE–Essential Skills, but not if they were taking the ABE-core program.
70. We found that adult learners faced barriers to accessing the PASS program and obtaining enough credits to graduate. As of September 2018, eight participants in the program had met the territory’s high school graduation requirements.
71. We found that Nunavut Arctic College offered college preparatory programs in only a few communities. As a result, many adult learners would need to leave their communities to access them. The College had limited base funding for College Foundation, preventing it from offering that program more widely. Learners taking these programs are eligible for financial aid through Adult Learning and Training Supports (ALTS). However, ALTS does not cover the costs of dependents (which includes children and unemployed spouses).
72. Our analysis supporting this finding presents what we examined and discusses the following topics:
- Access to Nunavut Arctic College’s core Adult Basic Education program
- Access to programs for adults wanting to obtain high school diplomas
- Support for adults wanting to obtain high school diplomas by attending high school in their communities
- Access to college preparatory programs offered by Nunavut Arctic College
- Information for decision making
73. This finding matters because to improve their education levels and be more employable, adult learners need access to programs that allow them opportunities to
- upgrade core academic skills, including literacy and numeracy skills;
- obtain their high school diplomas; and
- pursue post-secondary education, skills or trades training, or employment.
74. Our recommendations in this area of examination appear at paragraphs 87, 94, and 95.
75. What we examined. We examined whether adult learners had access to selected types of adult education programs and financial aid through the Financial Assistance for Nunavut Students (FANS) and ALTS programs.
76. Access to Nunavut Arctic College’s core Adult Basic Education program. We found that the College offered its ABE–Essential Skills program in 18 of 25 communities at least three times over the past five school years (2014–2015 to 2018–2019) (Exhibit 2). This program is designed to develop English and math skills at the 120 level, along with other skills adult learners need for entry-level or semi-skilled jobs in Nunavut.

77. In contrast, we found that adult learners had far less access to the College’s ABE-core program that would allow them to develop basic literacy and numeracy skills equivalent to grades 1 to 3 (Level 110) or more advanced academic skills equivalent to grades 7 to 12 (Level 130 and above). The College delivered its ABE-core program in only 4 of 25 communities in Nunavut at least three times over the past five school years (2014–2015 to 2018–2019), all of them in the Kitikmeot Region (Exhibit 3). During the same period, the College did not offer its ABE-core program in 17 of 25 communities. As a result, adults living in these communities had limited access to upgrading that would allow them to become eligible to enter various Nunavut Arctic College programs, such as preparatory programs, trades programs, and the Nunavut Teachers Education Program.

Source: Based on data provided by Nunavut Arctic College (data unaudited)
78. We found that the lack of access to ABE-core also presented a barrier to adult learners who wanted to enter the PASS program. We found that 165 of 452 applications (37%) to PASS over five semesters (fall 2016 to fall 2018) were denied because the applicants did not have the required competencies in grade 10 or 11 English reading and writing (Level 140) to enter PASS. College staff informed us that they tried to help these adult learners to develop learning plans. However, the College said that these learners often had nowhere to go to upgrade their skills so they could qualify for PASS, either because ABE-core was not offered in their communities or because they could not go when the program was offered. Returning to high school may be an option for some learners but not necessarily for those who work or have children or other family responsibilities.
79. We found that more than half of the applicants (87 of 165, or 53%) not accepted into PASS over the five semesters we examined came from six communities—Iqaluit, Arviat, Baker Lake, Pond Inlet, Rankin Inlet, and Whale Cove—where the ABE-core program was not offered during the past five years.
80. The Nunavut Adult Learning Strategy recommended increasing adult night-school options. We found that ABE classes were offered only during weekdays and only from September to April; no classes were offered at night or on weekends, or from May to August. This presented barriers to learners who were not available during the day, because of work or family responsibilities, or who wanted to take classes during the spring and summer.
81. Several factors affected the College’s ability to provide its ABE-core program in communities, including
- a lack of necessary skills and experience by some adult educators to teach the ABE-core program,
- limited space in some community learning centres, and
- limited funding for ABE-core programming and instructors.
82. We found that adult learners taking ABE–Essential Skills were eligible for financial aid through ALTS. However, those taking ABE-core were not eligible for this support. According to the Department of Family Services, ABE upgrading programs without a work-related component cannot be funded by ALTS.
83. Access to programs for adults wanting to obtain high school diplomas. We found that most adult learners enrolled in PASS could take all of the courses offered through the program and still not be eligible to graduate. Like high school students, PASS participants need at least 100 credits to obtain their high school diplomas. Through PASS, learners can take up to seven courses and earn up to 35 credits. However, most learners (71%) accepted into PASS (for whom high school credit information was recorded) between fall 2016 and fall 2018 had fewer than 65 credits (Exhibit 4).

Source: Based on data provided by Nunavut Arctic College (data unaudited)
84. We found that the Department of Education intended to create a policy that would grant a high school diploma to adult learners who completed the seven courses offered through PASS, even if they did not have the 100 credits required. However, it never established this policy. As of September 2018, eight PASS learners had met the territory’s high school graduation requirements.
85. According to Nunavut Arctic College, the average success rate for PASS courses was 14%. PASS did not offer one-on-one academic support to students in their communities. However, learners could access academic support online or by telephone from instructors in Iqaluit.
86. We found that the Department and the College did not offer (through PASS or other means) courses such as Grade 12 science or advanced levels of English or math to adult learners not attending their local high schools. Such courses are needed for admission to the College’s degree programs, such as nursing or teaching, and other post-secondary programs outside of the territory. Nor did they offer a program for adults who had high school diplomas and wanted to upgrade their marks or take new courses. Adults could take courses that they needed online, but they would have to pay for the courses. Some courses can cost up to $1,000 each; however, neither FANS nor ALTS reimburses those learners. Furthermore, ALTS funds only full-time programs—those with a minimum of 30 hours of in-class instruction per week. As a result, adult learners in part-time programs such as Nunavut Arctic College’s Language Revitalization program, offered in Cambridge Bay, were not eligible for ALTS funding.
87. Recommendation. The Department of Education should review the requirements needed to obtain a high school diploma through the Pathway to Adult Secondary School Graduation program (PASS) and determine whether alternative requirements for obtaining a Nunavut high school diploma should be established for adult learners.
The Department’s response. Agreed. The Department of Education is reviewing the requirements needed to obtain a high school diploma through the PASS program. The Department had identified a policy gap for the program wherein it cannot currently issue a high school diploma to graduates of the PASS program unless they have 100 credits.
To address this issue, the Department commissioned a review of the PASS program in April 2018 to identify the policy gaps and offer recommendations for addressing them. While this circumstance has not occurred (to date, all PASS graduates have thus far been issued high school diplomas), the Department has identified the potential for this situation to occur while this policy gap exists.
The Department is currently working on addressing this policy gap so that all graduates of the PASS program can be issued high school diplomas. The Department expects to have this policy gap resolved by the spring of 2019.
88. Support for adults wanting to obtain high school diplomas by attending high school in their communities. Learners over the age of 21 can attend high school in their communities, subject to the approval of the District Education Authority. However, we found that the Department of Education did not have any specific policies for schools on programming or supports for adult learners who wished to attend high school in their communities. Nor did the Department provide schools with any extra funding to support the needs of adult learners. Schools had to assign staff from their teaching rosters for these purposes.
89. We noted that two of the seven schools we examined had dedicated classroom space for adult learners and were flexible about attendance and course deadlines. Adult learners could take a variety of courses that they needed to graduate, including English, science, math, and social studies, and receive one-on-one support from a teacher. According to school staff, flexibility and personalized attention are key to the success of adult learners, some of whom have full- or part-time jobs or family responsibilities. We noted that one of the schools had to end special classes for adult learners in the 2017–2018 school year when it lost teaching positions and had to move teachers elsewhere.
90. Access to college preparatory programs offered by Nunavut Arctic College. We found that Nunavut Arctic College offered its College Foundation program in Iqaluit in four of the past five years and at least twice in each region in the past five years (Exhibit 5). The College had limited base funding for this program and relied on third-party funding to offer this program outside of Iqaluit.

Source: Based on data provided by Nunavut Arctic College (data unaudited)
91. The College also offered a College Foundation program—specifically for learners who wished to enter the Nunavut Teacher Education Program—in seven communities other than Iqaluit over the past five years. In 2018, the College decided that it would stop offering this specific foundation program. As a result, all learners, including those who wanted to enter the teaching program, had to rely on the regular College Foundation program. The College told us that to offer its College Foundation program outside of Iqaluit, it would need third-party funding.
92. We noted that the College offered pre-nursing in Iqaluit and pre-apprenticeship programs in Rankin Inlet. We found that learners taking these preparatory programs, as well as College Foundation and some preparatory programs at other post-secondary institutions, were eligible for financial assistance only under the ALTS program. While FANS provides learners with an increased living allowance for their dependents (which includes children and unemployed spouses), and funding to cover the travel costs of their dependents, these benefits are not available through ALTS. According to the College, 55% of students in their programs had children. The lack of financial aid for dependents under ALTS could be a barrier to learners wanting to advance their education.
93. Information for decision making. We found that the College was not consistently collecting information on the number of program applicants or on the results of entrance tests, and there was little sharing of this information within the College. Consistently collecting and analyzing data would be useful for the College to
- assess what literacy and other academic upgrading programs adult learners need,
- plan course delivery, and
- determine the extent to which program delivery in communities is meeting the Nunavut Adult Learning Strategy’s objective of a flexible and accessible learning system.
94. Recommendation. Nunavut Arctic College should ensure that it collects information on program applicants consistently and uses it to inform decisions such as when and where to offer adult literacy and academic upgrading programs. The College should also ensure that relevant information is shared among partners involved in supporting adult learners, such as the Department of Education and the Department of Family Services.
The College’s response. Agreed. During the 2018–2019 academic year, the Nunavut Arctic College moved up the schedule of community assessments, which are reports annually collected by College staff in communities and are used to drive determination of which programs are delivered in which community. This enabled College staff to determine upcoming programs in a timelier manner, so that information could be provided to the public earlier than previously possible.
The College also recognizes a need for more quantitative information to play a role in determining program deliveries at campuses and community learning centres. The College is currently in the midst of implementing a new Student Information System which will allow the College to more easily collapse data into aggregate reports to inform decision making.
The College will initiate, in the upcoming academic year, discussions with the Advanced Education Division of the Department of Education on how the College and the Department can align each organization’s respective information for the purpose of decision making on when and where to offer adult literacy and upgrading programs.
The College will also make an effort to initiate the creation of an ongoing working group of stakeholder departments involved in supporting adult learners, such as the Department of Education, the Department of Family Services, and potentially the new Department of Human Resources.
95. Recommendation. The Department of Family Services should review its financial aid programs to ensure that there are no unintended barriers to adult learners wishing to upgrade their education.
The Department’s response. Agreed. The Department of Family Services is presently reviewing its financial aid programs to ensure that they meet the needs of Nunavummiut. The Department anticipates implementing minor changes in September 2019. Major changes are subject to approval by the Legislative Assembly of Nunavut.
Conclusion
96. We concluded that selected Government of Nunavut organizations had not adequately supported youth and adult learners’ transition to post-secondary education and employment.

Independent Auditor’s Report
Introduction
Background
1. Environment and Climate Change Canada’s climate data indicates that between 1948 and 2016, average temperatures increased by up to 2.7 degrees Celsius in Nunavut and by 1.7 degrees Celsius in Canada as a whole. In Nunavut, these rises in temperature have caused changes to ice conditions, permafrost, and precipitation. The Government of Nunavut’s Department of Environment has reported that this warming trend will likely continue.
2. Climate change research and local and traditional Inuit knowledge also indicate that Nunavut’s climate is changing. Exhibit 1 lists some of the impacts of climate change on Nunavut and the Arctic. While not all impacts can be attributed to climate change, it is a major factor.
Exhibit 1—Examples of impacts of climate change on Nunavut and the Arctic
Type of change: Warming
Impacts: Arctic sea ice has reduced.
Examples:
- The shortened and less reliable ice season has affected those who travel on sea ice. It affects cultural connections with the local environment as well as hunting and fishing, which can affect income and food security.
- Researchers have found that reduced sea ice has led to increased shipping activity in some areas surrounding Nunavut. This presents Nunavut with economic opportunities but also increases the risk of incidents that require emergency response, such as fuel spills.
- Less ice means less protection from waves and storm surges. Researchers have identified the communities of Clyde River, Hall Beach, and Kugluktuk as being vulnerable to coastal erosion and flooding.
Impacts: Permafrost is warming.
Example:
- Nunavut’s communities are built on permafrost, which is ground that has been frozen for two or more years. Warming air and ground temperatures have caused permafrost to warm. In some areas of Nunavut, warming permafrost has created hazards for residents, affected some land-based travel routes, and presented risks to archaeological sites. Thawing permafrost also poses risks to infrastructure, such as shifting, foundation distress, and other structural problems in buildings.
Type of change: Changing precipitation levels
Impacts: The annual average amount of regional snowfall has increased. Snow is melting earlier in the year.
Examples:
- In some instances, severe rain events have led to local flooding and washouts. For example, in Pangnirtung in 2008, significant damage to two bridges from a rainstorm and rapid snowmelt prevented access to the community’s water reservoir, sewage treatment plant, and landfill site.
- In Coral Harbour in 2012, significant damage to a road and bridge from rain and rapid snowmelt caused the community to be without access to its airport for about one week. The flooding also damaged the resupply pipeline for the community’s fuel tank farm.

3. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a leading cause of climate change is the emission into the atmosphere of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, from fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes. Although Nunavut is a small emitter of greenhouse gases, it is particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.
4. Virtually all of Nunavut’s greenhouse gas emissions come from using fossil fuels, such as diesel, gasoline, and jet fuel. These fuels are used for a variety of purposes, such as for generating electricity, for heating homes, and for various modes of transportation, and play a key role in the daily lives of Nunavummiut (the people of Nunavut). Providing reliable energy to Nunavut’s communities is particularly critical given the territory’s cold Arctic winters, during which average monthly temperatures in some communities are minus 25 degrees Celsius and below.
5. Nunavut relies entirely on imported fuels, which are supplied by ship to communities during the summer season. This makes the territory vulnerable to price increases, unforeseen supply disruptions, and fuel spills.
6. In its efforts to help Nunavut adapt to climate change and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the Government of Nunavut faces a number of challenges, such as
- delivering programs to and managing infrastructure in 25 communities, which are spread across almost 2 million square kilometres and are difficult to access (by air year-round and by sealift);
- addressing immediate priorities in areas such as health, housing, and education; and
- dealing with constraints on human resources, including high vacancies and staff turnover within the government.
7. Responding to the impacts of climate change is a shared responsibility. It requires collaboration within and across governments, and with municipalities, Inuit and non-governmental organizations, industry, and the public.
8. The Department of Environment’s Climate Change Secretariat is the lead for climate change in the territory. The result of a merger at the end of 2016 between the Department of Environment’s Climate Change Section and the Department of Economic Development and Transportation’s Energy Secretariat, the Climate Change Secretariat is responsible for managing the Government of Nunavut’s climate change policies and programs. This includes
Adaptation—Actions taken to prevent or reduce the negative impacts of climate change and/or build on positive impacts.
- developing adaptation programs, policies, and partnerships, which assist Nunavut in adapting to and minimizing the projected impacts of climate change;
- leading the inter-agency development of strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to lessen the territory’s reliance on imported diesel;
- encouraging the exchange of knowledge and information about climate change based on science and Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit (that is, traditional Inuit knowledge and values); and
- coordinating climate change actions for government departments, agencies, and communities.
9. A number of other government departments also have roles in preparing Nunavut to adapt to climate change and reducing its greenhouse gas emissions, such as
- the Department of Community and Government Services, which manages government-owned property;
- the Nunavut Housing Corporation, which manages almost 7,000 public and staff housing units; and
- the Qulliq Energy Corporation, Nunavut’s public utility.
Focus of the audit
10. This audit focused on whether selected Government of Nunavut organizations took measures to prepare for and adapt to the impacts of climate change on Nunavut and took measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in Nunavut.
11. This audit is important because climate change is affecting the daily life, traditional activities, and infrastructure in Nunavut. The government needs to know what it has to do to help the people of Nunavut adapt and make the territory resilient to the impacts of climate change. Increasing energy efficiency and using more renewable energy help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the territory’s dependence on fossil fuels.
12. We examined whether the Government of Nunavut had
- developed a strategy for adapting to climate change and reducing greenhouse gas emissions,
- developed an implementation plan for the strategy,
- monitored and reported on the implementation of its strategy, and
- assessed climate change risks to Nunavut and Nunavummiut.
13. We also examined specific measures that selected government organizations had taken to adapt to climate change and reduce greenhouse gas emissions:
- the efforts of the Department of Community and Government Services and the Nunavut Housing Corporation to adapt to climate change; and
- the efforts of the Department of Community and Government Services, the Nunavut Housing Corporation, and the Qulliq Energy Corporation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
14. We did not examine the role of other Government of Nunavut departments or municipal governments in adapting to the impacts of climate change or in reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
15. In 2016, many legislative audit offices across Canada decided to look at the issue of climate change and developed similar audit approaches and questions to examine climate change action within their governments. As part of this initiative, the Office of the Auditor General of Canada decided to do federal and territorial climate change audits.
16. More details about the audit objective, scope, approach, and criteria are in About the Audit at the end of this report.
Findings, Recommendations, and Responses
Planning and preparing
Overall message
17. Overall, we found that the Government of Nunavut was not adequately prepared to respond to climate change. Although it had strategies for adapting to climate change and managing the territory’s energy use and greenhouse gas emissions, it did not have implementation plans that outlined how and when the objectives of the strategies would be met and who would be responsible for what. It also did not publicly report on its implementation of either strategy. We also found that the Government of Nunavut did not fully assess the risks of climate change to Nunavut.
18. These findings matter because implementation plans provide direction to departments so that they can respond in a coordinated manner to the risks and impacts of climate change. Public reporting informs Nunavummiut about the Government of Nunavut’s progress in addressing climate change and keeps it accountable. Assessing the risks of climate change ensures that the government has the information it needs to direct its actions and resources to the most important areas.
The Government of Nunavut had strategies for adapting to climate change and managing its energy use but lacked plans to implement them
19. We found that the Government of Nunavut had a strategy for responding to the impacts of climate change and a strategy for managing its energy use and reducing its reliance on fossil fuels and greenhouse gases. However, both strategies lacked clear and measurable commitments, and timelines. The government prepared draft implementation plans, which outlined the actions needed to achieve the objectives, along with timelines, deliverables, and responsibilities. However, these plans were never finalized.
20. We also found that the government did not set a target for reducing greenhouse gas emissions or publicly report on the implementation of both of its adaptation and energy strategies.
21. Our analysis supporting this finding presents what we examined and discusses the following topics:
22. This finding matters because strategies and implementation plans give departments direction on the priorities and actions they need to take to adapt to climate change and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Identifying who is responsible for taking action, the expected deliverables, and the related timelines are important for tracking progress and holding the Government of Nunavut accountable for results.
23. Reporting publicly on progress is important because it tells Nunavummiut what the government has done to address the impacts of climate change and to reduce the territory’s greenhouse gas emissions and its reliance on fossil fuels.
24. Our recommendation in this area of examination appears at paragraph 36.
25. What we examined. We examined whether the Government of Nunavut had a strategy and implementation plan for adapting to the impacts of climate change and reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and whether the government publicly reported on progress.
26. Adaptation strategy. In 2011, the Department of Environment released Upagiaqtavut: Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation in Nunavut, a framework for climate change adaptation initiatives in Nunavut. Its purpose is to provide strategic direction and enable Nunavummiut to better adapt to current and future changes brought on by climate change.
27. The strategy contained 11 objectives under 4 themes: partnership building, research and monitoring, education and outreach, and government policy and planning. We found that its objectives focused on actions to be taken, not on outcomes. The strategy did not explain who would be responsible for achieving the objectives and lacked timelines for completing actions.
28. The Government of Nunavut’s Cabinet directed the Department of Environment to work with all departments to develop a plan to implement the strategy. In 2014, the Department of Environment, with input from other departments, produced a five-year draft action plan, which outlined the actions to be taken to achieve the objectives, the timelines for completing these actions, the deliverables, and the responsibilities for completing the actions. We found that the draft action plan was never finalized.
29. Energy strategy. In 2007, the Government of Nunavut released Ikummatiit: The Government of Nunavut Energy Strategy. Covering the period from 2007 to 2020, the strategy aims to reduce Nunavut’s dependence on fossil fuels, improve energy security, and reduce air pollution and greenhouse gases. These objectives are to be achieved by, among other things, increasing energy efficiency and using alternatives to fossil fuels.
30. The strategy contains 42 policy actions designed to fulfill its objectives. We found that it did not state who was responsible for implementing about two thirds of the actions and did not set any timelines for completing actions.
31. After the release of the strategy, Cabinet directed the Energy Secretariat (at the time, located in the Department of Executive and Intergovernmental Affairs) to work with relevant departments to develop an implementation plan for the strategy. We found that, in 2010, the Secretariat produced a detailed draft plan, which included descriptions of how policy actions would be implemented, timelines, deliverables, and responsibilities; however, the plan was never finalized.
32. Monitoring and public reporting. We found that the monitoring of the adaptation and energy strategies was limited. Although both contained commitments to produce annual public reports, these were never produced. An interdepartmental climate change working group was established to coordinate implementation and public reporting for both strategies, but the group was inactive and had not met in many years.
Reduction targets for greenhouse gas emissions—Targets that can be absolute or intensity targets. Absolute targets refer to reducing greenhouse gas emissions over time. Intensity targets refer to reducing the ratio of greenhouse gas emissions over time relative to a particular measurement, such as per capita or gross domestic product (GDP). Both types of targets often have a base year and target year.
33. Reduction targets. We examined whether the Government of Nunavut had set reduction targets for greenhouse gas emissions and whether it was monitoring the territory’s emissions. Targets are important because they communicate what the government wants to achieve and act as a benchmark for measuring progress. Monitoring emissions helps determine whether progress is being made to reduce them.
34. We found that the government did not set targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions or other energy-related targets, such as how much power it wanted to produce using renewable energy. However, we did find that the Climate Change Secretariat was monitoring the territory’s greenhouse gas emissions. A report on energy use and greenhouse gas emission trends in the territory was produced for the Secretariat in early 2017. Department officials told us that they were reviewing the report and expected to use it to establish a comprehensive greenhouse gas inventory.
35. We noted differences between Nunavut’s estimated greenhouse gas emissions and those in Environment and Climate Change Canada’s 2017 national greenhouse gas emission inventory. Although both sources of information indicated that Nunavut’s emissions were increasing, they differed in terms of Nunavut’s total emissions and the share of emissions by sector (for example, transportation, heating, and electricity). Secretariat officials told us that they were investigating these differences and were participating in a federal/territorial working group to improve emission estimates for the territories.
36. Recommendation. The Department of Environment, in collaboration with other key departments, should develop an implementation plan for the Government of Nunavut’s climate change strategies that
- identifies priorities along with concrete actions, timelines, and costs;
- includes reduction targets for greenhouse gas emissions;
- clearly identifies roles and responsibilities, including who is responsible for overseeing the implementation of the plan and accountabilities for implementing actions; and
- requires monitoring and reporting on the plan’s progress.
The plan should consider actions taken to date and be informed by an assessment of climate change risks.
The Department of Environment’s response. Agreed. The Department of Environment, through the Climate Change Secretariat, will collaborate with other key departments to identify priorities, concrete actions, timelines, costs, and implementation plans for climate change strategies. These strategies aim to take action on Nunavut’s greenhouse gas emissions, reliance on diesel fuel, and role in adapting and combatting climate change.
The Climate Change Secretariat was formed in November 2016 and has since begun work on a variety of foundational projects that will well position the Department of Environment to facilitate responding to such a recommendation. Preliminary work on community energy planning, greenhouse gas emissions, and alternative energy inventories will support the Government of Nunavut’s ability to identify realistic and reasonable greenhouse gas emission targets.
The Government of Nunavut did not fully assess the risks of climate change
37. We found that the Government of Nunavut did not fully assess the risks of climate change to Nunavut and Nunavummiut. For example, it did not assess which communities might be at greatest risk, how climate change could affect the delivery of government programs and services, and the impacts of climate change on biodiversity. We found that the government did assess risks for selected topics, such as the risks of climate change to sources of drinking water in communities. For seven communities, it also produced maps that identified areas unsuitable for development due to risks from the thawing of permafrost.
38. Our analysis supporting this finding presents what we examined and discusses the following topic:
39. This finding matters because understanding the risks of climate change enables the Government of Nunavut to prioritize the steps it needs to take to ensure that Nunavut is resilient to the impacts of climate change. It also helps identify what steps need to be taken to ensure government services (such as the annual resupply of fuel to communities) and infrastructure (such as airports, health centres, and schools) are resilient to climate change. Identifying areas in communities at risk due to changes in permafrost helps local governments avoid developing in these areas.
40. Our recommendation in this area of examination appears at paragraph 49.
41. What we examined. We examined whether the Government of Nunavut had assessed the risks of climate change, including their impact and how likely they were to occur.
42. Assessing climate change risks. We found that the Government of Nunavut’s adaptation strategy identified the potential risks that climate change poses to Nunavut, including the potential impacts on current and future generations. However, it had not analyzed or ranked these risks in terms of their impacts and the likelihood that they would occur, nor had it assessed which communities and regions could be most affected by climate change.
43. The five-year draft action plan that was prepared for Nunavut’s adaptation strategy contained several proposed actions designed to better understand the risks of climate change, including the following to be led by the Department of Environment:
- assessing the risks of climate change to the government;
- developing tools to assess the costs and benefits of taking actions to adapt to climate change and the costs—environmental, economic, and social—of not acting; and
- identifying the impacts of climate change to biodiversity, including on hunting and traditional ways of life.
44. These are important steps to take to better understand the risks of climate change; however, we found that the Department of Environment did not follow through on these actions. Department officials noted difficulties in weighing and ranking one impact against another as a challenge to assessing risks.
45. We found that risks for selected topics were assessed. An assessment of climate change risks to Nunavut’s mining sector, including to infrastructure such as access roads, airstrips, and tailings (mining waste) facilities, was produced for the Department of Environment and other organizations. The Department also began to develop guidance for its staff on how to consider climate change during their reviews of environmental impact assessments of proposed projects. Climate change considerations could include the project’s greenhouse gas emissions and the potential impact of climate change on the proposed project.
46. We found that the Department of Community and Government Services, with support from the Department of Environment and other organizations, conducted a terrain mapping project to inform community planning and help identify areas unsuitable for development. The project produced maps for seven communities (Arviat, Baker Lake, Cape Dorset, Gjoa Haven, Kimmirut, Kugluktuk, and Pangnirtung). These maps identified areas at risk of instability due to changes in permafrost and other hazards, such as proximity to a body of water.
47. We also found that an assessment of the risks to primary sources of drinking water was prepared in 2017 for the Department of Community and Government Services and the Department of Health (Exhibit 2).
Exhibit 2—Primary sources of drinking water in some of Nunavut’s communities were identified as high risk
In 2017, a desktop risk assessment of primary sources of drinking water in Nunavut's communities (outside of Iqaluit) was completed for the Department of Community and Government Services and the Department of Health. The assessment considered a number of factors, including the size of the community's watershed, population growth, and future climate scenarios. The assessment identified six communities at high risk of water scarcity between 2016 and 2040, as a result of their watershed sizes, of growing water demands, and of climate change: Cambridge Bay, Cape Dorset, Clyde River, Igloolik, Rankin Inlet, and Taloyoak. According to Department of Community and Government Services officials, the results of the assessment were being used to determine next steps, including onsite research.
48. Finally, we found that the Department of Environment acted to increase awareness of the risks of climate change. It created the Nunavut Climate Change Centre, a web-based climate change resource to provide climate change information to Nunavummiut. The website includes an online database of information about permafrost. The Department also provided training to government officials on climate change.
49. Recommendation. The Department of Environment’s Climate Change Secretariat, in collaboration with other Government of Nunavut organizations, should analyze and rank the risks of climate change to Nunavut on the basis of their potential impacts and how likely they are to occur. Results of this analysis should be used to inform future climate change priorities and actions.
The Department of Environment’s response. Agreed. The Department of Environment intends to work with other Government of Nunavut organizations and external bodies to identify and rank climate change risks and hazards to Nunavut.
The Department of Environment will host a pan-northern meeting in March 2018 on permafrost hazard mapping. This will bring northern communities and government decision makers together to determine risks, opportunities, and recommendations to better manage and respond to permafrost thaw and other climate change risks. Best practices and lessons learned from this session will help inform future work conducted to address other identified risks. Additional work is scheduled to begin the development of climate change risk mitigation criteria for decision makers.
Taking action
Overall message
50. Overall, we found that the Department of Community and Government Services and the Nunavut Housing Corporation had measures to help protect buildings from the impacts of climate change on permafrost, but these measures were not fully implemented. These organizations and the Qulliq Energy Corporation did take steps to improve the energy efficiency of government assets, including government buildings in Iqaluit, public housing units, and power plants. However, the use of renewable energy, such as solar and wind, was limited due in part to high capital costs.
51. These findings matter because infrastructure can be protected from the impacts of climate change. Designing buildings with the potential impacts of climate change on permafrost in mind and assessing existing buildings and other infrastructure for potential problems from changing permafrost can reduce the risk of damage and the need for costly repairs. A government that owns energy-efficient assets and uses renewable energy sources can help reduce the demand for and dependence on fossil fuels, and the emissions of greenhouse gases. This can also support the government’s vision of self-reliant Nunavummiut and of Qanuqtuurniq—the Inuit societal value of being innovative and resourceful.
52. Climate change has caused air and ground temperatures in Canada’s north to increase, causing permafrost to warm. As permafrost warms, the ground can thaw, causing it to settle. Increased ground temperatures can also cause the active layer—the top layer of ground that freezes and thaws in permafrost zones—to deepen, increasing upward ground movement due to frost heave.
53. When ground settles and frost heave occurs, buildings on permafrost, such as schools, health centres, and public housing units, can shift and suffer distress or damage. This can include cracks in foundations and walls, uneven floors, doors and windows that do not close or seal properly, and leaks from supply or sewage lines, all of which can require repairs.
54. According to data collected by Natural Resources Canada at selected sites across Nunavut, permafrost temperatures increased between 2008 and 2014. With increased temperatures projected to occur because of climate change, warming of permafrost is expected to continue.
55. Putting skirting or piling snow around foundations can also degrade and thaw permafrost, because it insulates permafrost from cold air and allows the heat from the building to warm the permafrost below. Water that pools around buildings due to poor drainage or melting snow can also cause permafrost to degrade.
56. Canadian standards and technical guidance outline measures that can be taken to protect infrastructure from the impacts of degrading and thawing permafrost. These include the National Standard of Canada for Geotechnical Site Investigations for Building Foundations in Permafrost Zones (2017); the National Standard of Canada for Moderating the Effects of Permafrost Degradation on Existing Building Foundations (2014); and the Technical Guide—Infrastructure in Permafrost: A Guideline for Climate Change Adaptation (2010). These measures involve
- conducting geotechnical site investigations of planned building sites, which consider permafrost conditions and projected changes due to climate change (done before construction, these investigations are used to inform the design of foundations that are appropriate for the building site and are resilient to the impacts of climate change on permafrost over the life of the structure); and
- periodically inspecting and assessing buildings for signs of distress or damage due to ground settlement, frost heave, and permafrost degradation, and taking appropriate measures to avoid future damage, such as adjusting or levelling foundations.
57. Once the thawing of permafrost begins, stopping it is usually difficult and expensive. Therefore, it is essential to help preserve permafrost both beneath and beside a building. This can be achieved by implementing measures such as
- properly managing snow and drainage around buildings to avoid water from pooling (Exhibit 3), and
- ensuring spaces underneath buildings are properly ventilated to prevent permafrost from warming.
Exhibit 3—Ensuring proper drainage around facilities, such as the Leo Ussak School in Rankin Inlet, can help avoid water from pooling and reduce the risk of permafrost degradation

The Department of Community and Government Services and the Nunavut Housing Corporation had measures to safeguard government buildings from the impacts of climate change on permafrost, but these measures were not fully implemented
58. We found that the Department of Community and Government Services and the Nunavut Housing Corporation collected information on permafrost conditions through geotechnical site investigations to inform the design of their buildings and other infrastructure. Climate projections were considered in most of the cases we examined. We also found that both organizations did not always carry out building assessments as scheduled, which can help identify potential problems caused by changes in permafrost. Finally, we found that both organizations did not consistently incorporate measures into their operations and maintenance procedures for managing snow and water around buildings that could help prevent permafrost degradation.
59. Our analysis supporting this finding presents what we examined and discusses the following topics:
60. This finding matters because having measures in place to safeguard Nunavut’s buildings from changing permafrost conditions can prevent damage from occurring. Considering climate projections when conducting geotechnical site investigations helps ensure that building foundations are resilient to the potential impacts of climate change on permafrost. Periodically assessing existing buildings and proactively managing water and snow can help minimize and avoid damage and related repairs that can occur due to permafrost degradation and thaw.
61. Our recommendations in this area of examination appear at paragraphs 64, 71, 72, and 74.
62. What we examined. We examined whether the Department of Community and Government Services and the Nunavut Housing Corporation had
- conducted geotechnical site investigations for selected projects (seven infrastructure projects built by the Department of Community and Government Services and nine public housing units built by the Nunavut Housing Corporation) and considered climate projections in these investigations;
- assessed buildings (such as schools, health centres, and housing units) for signs of damage from thawing permafrost; and
- developed procedures to manage water and snow around their facilities to avoid permafrost degradation.
63. Geotechnical site investigations. We found that both the Department of Community and Government Services and the Nunavut Housing Corporation conducted geotechnical site investigations or used geotechnical information to inform the design and construction of infrastructure on permafrost. Climate projections were considered in six of the seven investigations conducted by the Department and five of the nine investigations conducted by the Corporation. Incorporating this type of information is important for ensuring that building foundations and other infrastructure are resilient to climate change.
64. Recommendation. The Department of Community and Government Services and the Nunavut Housing Corporation should ensure that climate change projections are incorporated into geotechnical site investigations where required.
The Department of Community and Government Services’ response. Agreed. The Department of Community and Government Services will initiate measures to ensure that climate change projections are incorporated into the geotechnical site investigations where required going forward.
The Nunavut Housing Corporation’s response. Agreed. The Nunavut Housing Corporation will incorporate climate change predictions into future geotechnical studies, where necessary.
65. Building assessments. We found that both the Department of Community and Government Services and the Nunavut Housing Corporation had procedures for assessing those parts of buildings, such as foundations, that could be affected by permafrost settlement and degradation. However, these assessments were not always carried out as scheduled. As a result, the Department and the Corporation may have missed signs of distress being caused by changing permafrost conditions and may have delayed steps that could have been taken to avoid or reduce damage.
66. The Department of Community and Government Services officials indicated that the Department conducts semi-annual and five-year building condition assessments as part of the management of its buildings. These assessments cover a range of building components, such as windows, ceilings, foundations, and pads that could be affected by changing permafrost conditions. The Regional Director, Infrastructure, is responsible for the semi-annual assessments, while the Department’s Technical Services is responsible for the more detailed five-year assessments.
67. Department officials indicated that semi-annual assessments were often done annually due to a lack of resources and to weather-related problems. According to documentation provided by the Department, semi-annual or annual assessments were done from October 2015 to October 2017 for buildings in the Kivalliq and Qikiqtaaluk regions except in Iqaluit and Rankin Inlet, where the buildings were not assessed. Government buildings under the Department’s responsibility were assessed in the Kitikmeot Region only in 2017. Buildings in Cambridge Bay were not assessed from October 2015 to October 2017. We found that the level of detail in the assessment reports that were completed varied; the assessments also did not always follow a standardized template, which could have helped ensure that all relevant aspects of a building, including structural aspects, were considered.
68. For detailed assessments, we found that a third party did five-year building condition assessments of government buildings in 2012. Since then, the Department put a new process in place requiring that a minimum number of buildings undergo a detailed assessment every year and that all assets be covered within a five-year period. We found, on the basis of data it provided, that the Department had completed detailed assessments for the buildings under its responsibility in 12 of Nunavut’s 25 communities at the end of October 2017. The Department planned to assess the remaining buildings by the end of 2019. As a result, buildings in selected communities will have gone up to almost seven years without a detailed assessment.
69. We also found that the Department required annual inspections of thermosyphons (a system used to keep a foundation and surrounding permafrost cold). We found that the inspection procedure for thermosyphons was not integrated into the electronic system used by the Department to manage its maintenance activities. As a result, these inspections were not taking place. During our audit, the Department took steps to address this issue. According to the Department, at least 3 of the 13 systems under its responsibility had experienced problems.
70. For the Nunavut Housing Corporation, we found that it required that its buildings undergo detailed condition rating assessments every two years. These assessments follow a standardized template that covers structural issues, such as building foundations that could be affected by changes to permafrost. We found, on the basis of data provided by the Corporation, that fewer than half (about 43%) of its public housing units underwent a condition rating assessment between October 2015 and October 2017. We noted that to strengthen its maintenance practices, the Corporation had recently increased the number of staff in its Territorial Maintenance Division and was planning to introduce a new system for managing its condition rating assessments.
71. Recommendation. The Department of Community and Government Services should standardize its building assessment procedures and complete its building assessments according to its required schedule.
The Department of Community and Government Services’ response. Agreed. The Department of Community and Government Services will work with all internal organizations to standardize its building assessment procedures and complete building assessments of Government of Nunavut infrastructure in the year scheduled.
72. Recommendation. The Nunavut Housing Corporation should ensure that it completes its condition rating assessments according to its schedule.
The Nunavut Housing Corporation’s response. Agreed. The Nunavut Housing Corporation will work with its Local Housing Organizations to ensure building condition ratings are completed according to schedule. The Corporation expects to implement a new building-condition software system in the 2018–19 fiscal year.
73. Snow and water management. We found that the operations and maintenance procedures followed by the Department of Community and Government Services and the Nunavut Housing Corporation did not fully reflect practices recommended in Canadian standards for managing snow and water around buildings, which can help prevent permafrost degradation. Municipal governments play an important role in managing snow and drainage in their communities, including around government facilities. It will be important to involve them in any discussions regarding snow and water management.
74. Recommendation. The Department of Community and Government Services and the Nunavut Housing Corporation should develop best practices for managing snow and water to prevent permafrost degradation for their owned buildings and incorporate these practices into their operations and maintenance procedures. Where applicable, the two organizations should involve municipal governments in the discussions on snow and water management.
The Department of Community and Government Services’ response. Agreed. The Department of Community and Government Services will work with stakeholders, specifically the Nunavut Association of Municipalities, to educate and support the municipalities in the development and use of best practices for managing snow and water to prevent permafrost degradation of infrastructure objects.
The Nunavut Housing Corporation’s response. Agreed. The Nunavut Housing Corporation will work with the Department of Community and Government Services and municipalities to improve the management of drainage and snow accumulation issues.
Selected Government of Nunavut organizations took steps to improve the energy efficiency of some of their assets but faced barriers to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and Nunavut’s dependence on fossil fuels
75. We found that the Qulliq Energy Corporation, the Department of Community and Government Services, and the Nunavut Housing Corporation acted to improve the energy efficiency of some assets, including power plants, government buildings in Iqaluit, and new public housing units. The Qulliq Energy Corporation and the Department of Community and Government Services also had some small renewable energy projects in place. There were, however, barriers to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and Nunavut’s dependence on fossil fuels.
76. Our analysis supporting this finding presents what we examined and discusses the following topics:
- Qulliq Energy Corporation
- Nunavut Housing Corporation
- Department of Community and Government Services
77. This finding matters because improving the energy efficiency of government-owned assets (such as power plants and buildings) and getting power from renewable energy sources can help reduce Nunavut’s demand for fossil fuels and greenhouse gas emissions.
78. Our recommendations in this area of examination appear at paragraphs 91, 99, 100, and 105.
79. What we examined. We examined whether the Qulliq Energy Corporation, the Department of Community and Government Services, and the Nunavut Housing Corporation took steps to improve energy efficiency and were using renewable energy to reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. We did not audit the costs and benefits associated with the various projects discussed in this section.
80. Qulliq Energy Corporation. The Qulliq Energy Corporation supplies electricity to each of Nunavut’s 25 communities through stand-alone diesel power plants and community distribution grids. In the 2015 to 2016 fiscal year, the Corporation established a goal to reduce its dependence on fossil fuels by 2% by 2019. The Corporation told us that it would achieve this through improved fuel efficiency.
81. We found that the Corporation replaced or upgraded several of its power plants and was maintaining and operating them more efficiently. According to the Corporation’s data, although its consumption of diesel fuel increased between the 2012 to 2013 and 2015 to 2016 fiscal years, the Corporation was producing more power per litre of diesel, a sign that the fuel efficiency of its power plants had improved.
82. The Corporation was also operating district heating systems. These systems capture residual heat generated through electricity production at power plants and distribute the heat to customers for heating buildings. Using residual heat helps reduce the use of heating fuels and the emissions of greenhouse gases.
83. We found that although there was infrastructure for these systems in 9 communities, the Corporation was supplying heat to customers in only 4—Iqaluit, Rankin Inlet, Arviat, and Kugluktuk. The system in Pangnirtung was temporarily not operating due to a fire at the community’s power plant. The other systems were no longer operating, but according to the Corporation, documentation on why was incomplete. The Corporation’s data showed that between January 2014 and December 2016, the four operating systems had on average
- reduced customer demand for heating fuels (and reduced associated greenhouse gas emissions) by an estimated 2 million litres annually, and
- generated about $1.8 million per year in revenues.
84. According to the Corporation, district heating systems can be costly to build and upgrade, and these costs were a barrier to further enhancing and expanding these systems in Nunavut. The Corporation was exploring federal funding opportunities to help overcome this barrier.
85. We also found that the Corporation had taken steps toward using renewable energy (Exhibit 4).
Exhibit 4—The Qulliq Energy Corporation was investigating the use of renewable energy
Solar power. In 2016, the Qulliq Energy Corporation installed a small demonstration project on solar energy at its Iqaluit power plant. According to the Corporation, the project improved its knowledge of how solar panels perform in the Arctic. In 2017, the Corporation assessed the costs and benefits of installing a 500-kilowatt solar energy project in Iqaluit. The project was estimated to cost almost $7.5 million and to reduce fuel consumption by an estimated 196,000 litres per year and greenhouse gas emissions by an estimated 615 tonnes per year.
Wind power. In 2016, a study produced for the Qulliq Energy Corporation identified five communities with the highest potential for harnessing wind resources (Arviat, Baker Lake, Iqaluit, Rankin Inlet, and Sanikiluaq). The study estimated that wind turbines could displace diesel use by about 18% to 56% in these communities and would cost about $4.2 million to $68.8 million to install.
Hydroelectric power. The Corporation investigated using hydroelectric power in Iqaluit, which, according to the Corporation, could reduce the Corporation’s annual fuel consumption by up to an estimated 30% and provide a meaningful reduction in the territory’s greenhouse gas emissions. Hydro generators are also less expensive to maintain than their diesel counterparts. In the 2013 to 2014 fiscal year, the initiative was suspended in part due to the large capital investment required (over $350 million in 2013).
86. We found that the Corporation was planning to implement a net-metering program that would encourage small-scale renewable energy projects. Under the program, customers who generate electricity (for example, using solar panels) can send unused power to the Corporation and receive a credit. By using renewable energy, customers reduce their demand for fossil fuels, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and save energy costs. The program was still being finalized at the time of our audit.
87. According to the Corporation, there were a number of barriers to large-scale renewable energy projects:
- high capital costs, including the cost of batteries to store power;
- the need to replace or upgrade aging power plants in 13 communities, which limited the Corporation’s capacity to invest in other areas;
- technical challenges, such as the icing of wind turbine blades; and
- the need to ensure that local power plants and transmission grids remain stable when receiving intermittent energy generated by third parties using renewable energy.
88. We found that the Corporation was taking steps to overcome the capital cost of large renewable energy projects by considering federal funding opportunities and third-party financing and operation of these projects.
89. We also found that the Corporation was working to have the Qulliq Energy Corporation Act amended so that it could purchase power from third parties. It was also developing an independent power producers policy, which would outline to third parties how the Corporation would integrate power from them. The Corporation identified the end of 2018 as a timeline for completing these actions.
90. We found that the Corporation reported the fuel efficiency of its diesel power plants annually; however, it did not compare it with past performance, making it difficult to interpret trends. We also found that the Corporation did not set targets on using alternative energy, such as how many litres of diesel it wants to reduce by using renewable energy, or the proportion of total energy it wants to generate using alternative sources. It would be important to have such targets to assess the Corporation’s performance and to frame its approach to renewable energy. In addition, although the Corporation had investigated a number of different renewable energy options, it had not identified which initiatives will be priorities.
91. Recommendation. The Qulliq Energy Corporation should establish priorities and targets for renewable energy (such as what share of its energy production it wants to come from renewable energy). Targets should have a baseline and timelines against which the Corporation can measure performance. Future reporting by the Corporation should include its progress on its priorities and performance against targets.
The Qulliq Energy Corporation’s response. Agreed. The Qulliq Energy Corporation will consult with the Government of Nunavut to determine the territory’s renewable energy objectives. Following the consultation phase, the Corporation will review territorial objectives within the context of the Corporation’s unique operating environment; set the appropriate priorities, targets, and timelines; and report accordingly. The Corporation anticipates that the deployment of renewable energy technology will be impacted by the Corporation’s small rate base, along with financial, geographical, and technical challenges. These factors will need to be reconciled with the Corporation’s primary objective of delivering reliable and affordable energy in an Arctic setting.
92. Nunavut Housing Corporation. We examined measures the Nunavut Housing Corporation took to improve the energy efficiency of new public housing units. We found that the Corporation had installed energy-efficient lighting, appliances, and boilers into its new public housing units. It had also included improved insulation and energy-efficient windows in its new units to make them airtight and reduce heat loss. According to the results of a desktop evaluation, these new units exceeded the energy-efficiency requirements of the National Building Code of Canada. Although the Corporation did not have any renewable energy projects, it had plans to install a small-scale solar panel project in Baker Lake to understand its potential energy performance and maintenance requirements.
93. According to an analysis done by the Corporation, selected housing units built between 2006 and 2012 used from 10 to 13% less fuel (savings of about $600 in fuel costs) per unit per year compared with older units built in the 1980s and 1990s. However, the Corporation’s data indicated that per-unit costs for fuel and electricity increased between the 2011 to 2012 and 2016 to 2017 fiscal years.
94. We found that the Corporation did not have information on how the efficiency measures it introduced had performed. In 2017, the Corporation hired a financial analyst to analyze its fuel and electricity use, including consumption trends. According to the Corporation, an Energy Initiatives Coordinator position was created in 2015 to ensure that energy efficiency was maintained and improved for public housing units. However, the position was not filled.
95. We found that the Corporation did not set targets for reducing fuel and electricity use, nor did it report on trends in its fuel and electricity use. Setting a target and reporting on trends is important for assessing the impact that the Corporation’s energy-efficiency measures are having.
96. We also examined the Corporation’s maintenance of heat recovery ventilators (HRVs) in its public housing units. Because energy-efficient homes are designed to be airtight, with limited air circulation, HRVs are used to replace indoor air with fresh outdoor air. They help ensure good indoor air quality, control humidity, and avoid moisture build up, which can contribute to mold.
97. The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation commissioned a study on HRVs in northern Canada. Released in 2017, the study identified problems with installing, operating, and maintaining HRVs. These issues, along with the lack of HRVs in some housing units, were identified as potential reasons behind the presence of mold in some of the Nunavut Housing Corporation’s public housing units.
98. According to the Nunavut Housing Corporation, it has HRV units in 2,181 of its public housing units across the territory and requires all new public units to have HRVs. We found that it was not carrying out maintenance of its HRVs as required by its procedures. According to the Corporation’s data, 18% of the HRVs in its public housing units received required annual inspections and servicing during the 2016 to 2017 fiscal year. In 15 communities, none of the HRVs received annual maintenance. We noted that the Corporation was assessing options on how to improve its inspection and maintenance of HRVs.
99. Recommendation. The Nunavut Housing Corporation should set targets for fuel and electricity savings. Future reporting should include how fuel and electricity use has changed over time and discuss how the Corporation performed against its targets.
The Nunavut’s Housing Corporation’s response. Agreed. The Nunavut Housing Corporation plans to evaluate fuel and electrical consumption to identify areas offering potential savings based on any available funding specifically allocated for energy retrofits. Targets and future reporting will be informed by the results of this work, with the understanding that prioritization of this work will be dependent on Government of Nunavut mandates and the direction of the Corporation’s Board of Directors. The Corporation will comply with codes related to building design and energy efficiency in a northern climate.
100. Recommendation. The Nunavut Housing Corporation should take appropriate steps to ensure that heat recovery ventilators (HRVs) are maintained as required under its maintenance program.
The Nunavut Housing Corporation’s response. Agreed. The Nunavut Housing Corporation will ensure maintenance programs related to heat recovery ventilators (HRVs) are implemented according to schedule.
101. Department of Community and Government Services. We examined the Nunavut Energy Management Program of the Department of Community and Government Services. The program uses private-sector firms to conduct energy retrofits to government buildings, using future energy savings to repay the cost of the retrofits. The program set two objectives: a 20% reduction in energy consumption and an associated reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.
102. The program began in the 2008 to 2009 fiscal year with a pilot project in Iqaluit to retrofit 37 Government of Nunavut buildings. This included replacing existing interior and exterior lighting with new energy-efficient lights and fixtures; and installing heat-recovery systems, solar hot-water heating systems (Exhibit 5), and solar walls for air pre-heating.

103. According to the Department, the Iqaluit project cost $12.8 million and led to more than $1.8 million per year in savings in utility costs (including water, fuel, and electricity). It also reduced greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 2,090 tonnes per year. In mid-2017, the Department received approval to expand the program to the Kivalliq Region.
104. We found that the Department of Community and Government Services reported on the Iqaluit pilot project on its website. However, its reporting on the project’s costs and energy savings did not reflect current internal data and did not include reporting on estimated greenhouse gas reductions.
105. Recommendation. The Department of Community and Government Services should ensure that its public reporting on the Nunavut Energy Management Program is up to date.
The Department of Community and Government Services’ response. Agreed. The Department of Community and Government Services will endeavour to ensure that information pertaining to the Nunavut Energy Management Program is up to date on the Department’s website.
Conclusion
106. We concluded that the Government of Nunavut had a strategy for adapting to climate change, which considered potential changes and impacts on current and future generations. The government also had an energy strategy, which included policy actions aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. However, both strategies lacked plans that outlined how the strategies would be implemented and who would be responsible for what. The government had also not fully assessed the risks of climate change to Nunavut.
107. We also concluded that selected Government of Nunavut organizations had measures to safeguard government buildings from the impacts of climate change on permafrost, but these measures were not fully implemented. Selected government organizations took steps to make government assets more energy efficient. However, there were a number of barriers to implementing alternatives to fossil fuels, which would help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the territory’s reliance on fossil fuels.
About the Audit
This independent assurance report was prepared by the Office of the Auditor General of Canada on the response to climate change in Nunavut by the Department of Environment, the Department of Community and Government Services, the Nunavut Housing Corporation, and the Qulliq Energy Corporation. Our responsibility was to provide objective information, advice, and assurance to assist the Legislative Assembly in its scrutiny of the government’s management of resources and programs, and to conclude on whether selected departments’ implementation of climate change measures complied in all significant respects with the applicable criteria.
All work in this audit was performed to a reasonable level of assurance in accordance with the Canadian Standard for Assurance Engagements (CSAE) 3001—Direct Engagements set out by the Chartered Professional Accountants of Canada (CPA Canada) in the CPA Canada Handbook—Assurance.
The Office applies Canadian Standard on Quality Control 1 and, accordingly, maintains a comprehensive system of quality control, including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards, and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.
In conducting the audit work, we have complied with the independence and other ethical requirements of the relevant rules of professional conduct applicable to the practice of public accounting in Canada, which are founded on fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care, confidentiality, and professional behaviour.
In accordance with our regular audit process, we obtained the following from entity management:
- confirmation of management’s responsibility for the subject under audit;
- acknowledgement of the suitability of the criteria used in the audit;
- confirmation that all known information that has been requested, or that could affect the findings or audit conclusion, has been provided; and
- confirmation that the audit report is factually based.
Audit objective
The objective of this audit was to determine whether selected Government of Nunavut organizations took measures to reduce the territory’s emissions of greenhouse gases and to adapt to climate change impacts, taking into account these impacts on current and future generations.
Scope and approach
In the 2016 to 2017 fiscal year, many legislative audit offices across Canada decided to look at the issue of climate change and developed similar audit approaches and questions to examine climate change action within their governments. As part of this initiative, the Office of the Auditor General of Canada decided to do climate change audits of all territories.
We examined whether the Government of Nunavut had a strategy and action plan in place for adapting to climate change and reducing greenhouse gas emissions; whether it was monitoring and reporting on progress made in implementing its strategy; and whether it had assessed the risks of climate change. This part of the audit focused primarily on the Department of Environment.
We also examined specific measures that the Department of Community and Government Services, the Nunavut Housing Corporation, and the Qulliq Energy Corporation took to reduce Nunavut’s greenhouse gas emissions and its dependence on fossil fuels, through energy-efficiency improvements and renewable energy initiatives.
We also examined specific adaptation efforts of the Department of Community and Government Services, and the Nunavut Housing Corporation. In particular, we examined whether permafrost changes that can occur due to climate change were considered to inform the design of infrastructure and during the assessment of buildings (for example, schools, health centres, and housing units).
The audit involved reviewing and analyzing documents, interviews, and site visits. Department officials were interviewed as well as community stakeholders and representatives of local governments. We conducted field work in Iqaluit and in a select number of communities.
We did not examine the role of other Government of Nunavut departments, such as the Department of Finance, the Department of Executive and Intergovernmental Affairs, and the Department of Economic Development and Transportation, or municipal governments.

Independent Auditor’s Report
Introduction
Background
1. Environment and Climate Change Canada’s climate data indicates that between 1948 and 2016, average temperatures increased by up to 2.7 degrees Celsius in Nunavut and by 1.7 degrees Celsius in Canada as a whole. In Nunavut, these rises in temperature have caused changes to ice conditions, permafrost, and precipitation. The Government of Nunavut’s Department of Environment has reported that this warming trend will likely continue.
2. Climate change research and local and traditional Inuit knowledge also indicate that Nunavut’s climate is changing. Exhibit 1 lists some of the impacts of climate change on Nunavut and the Arctic. While not all impacts can be attributed to climate change, it is a major factor.
Exhibit 1—Examples of impacts of climate change on Nunavut and the Arctic
Type of change: Warming
Impacts: Arctic sea ice has reduced.
Examples:
- The shortened and less reliable ice season has affected those who travel on sea ice. It affects cultural connections with the local environment as well as hunting and fishing, which can affect income and food security.
- Researchers have found that reduced sea ice has led to increased shipping activity in some areas surrounding Nunavut. This presents Nunavut with economic opportunities but also increases the risk of incidents that require emergency response, such as fuel spills.
- Less ice means less protection from waves and storm surges. Researchers have identified the communities of Clyde River, Hall Beach, and Kugluktuk as being vulnerable to coastal erosion and flooding.
Impacts: Permafrost is warming.
Example:
- Nunavut’s communities are built on permafrost, which is ground that has been frozen for two or more years. Warming air and ground temperatures have caused permafrost to warm. In some areas of Nunavut, warming permafrost has created hazards for residents, affected some land-based travel routes, and presented risks to archaeological sites. Thawing permafrost also poses risks to infrastructure, such as shifting, foundation distress, and other structural problems in buildings.
Type of change: Changing precipitation levels
Impacts: The annual average amount of regional snowfall has increased. Snow is melting earlier in the year.
Examples:
- In some instances, severe rain events have led to local flooding and washouts. For example, in Pangnirtung in 2008, significant damage to two bridges from a rainstorm and rapid snowmelt prevented access to the community’s water reservoir, sewage treatment plant, and landfill site.
- In Coral Harbour in 2012, significant damage to a road and bridge from rain and rapid snowmelt caused the community to be without access to its airport for about one week. The flooding also damaged the resupply pipeline for the community’s fuel tank farm.

3. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a leading cause of climate change is the emission into the atmosphere of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, from fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes. Although Nunavut is a small emitter of greenhouse gases, it is particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.
4. Virtually all of Nunavut’s greenhouse gas emissions come from using fossil fuels, such as diesel, gasoline, and jet fuel. These fuels are used for a variety of purposes, such as for generating electricity, for heating homes, and for various modes of transportation, and play a key role in the daily lives of Nunavummiut (the people of Nunavut). Providing reliable energy to Nunavut’s communities is particularly critical given the territory’s cold Arctic winters, during which average monthly temperatures in some communities are minus 25 degrees Celsius and below.
5. Nunavut relies entirely on imported fuels, which are supplied by ship to communities during the summer season. This makes the territory vulnerable to price increases, unforeseen supply disruptions, and fuel spills.
6. In its efforts to help Nunavut adapt to climate change and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the Government of Nunavut faces a number of challenges, such as
- delivering programs to and managing infrastructure in 25 communities, which are spread across almost 2 million square kilometres and are difficult to access (by air year-round and by sealift);
- addressing immediate priorities in areas such as health, housing, and education; and
- dealing with constraints on human resources, including high vacancies and staff turnover within the government.
7. Responding to the impacts of climate change is a shared responsibility. It requires collaboration within and across governments, and with municipalities, Inuit and non-governmental organizations, industry, and the public.
8. The Department of Environment’s Climate Change Secretariat is the lead for climate change in the territory. The result of a merger at the end of 2016 between the Department of Environment’s Climate Change Section and the Department of Economic Development and Transportation’s Energy Secretariat, the Climate Change Secretariat is responsible for managing the Government of Nunavut’s climate change policies and programs. This includes
Adaptation—Actions taken to prevent or reduce the negative impacts of climate change and/or build on positive impacts.
- developing adaptation programs, policies, and partnerships, which assist Nunavut in adapting to and minimizing the projected impacts of climate change;
- leading the inter-agency development of strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to lessen the territory’s reliance on imported diesel;
- encouraging the exchange of knowledge and information about climate change based on science and Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit (that is, traditional Inuit knowledge and values); and
- coordinating climate change actions for government departments, agencies, and communities.
9. A number of other government departments also have roles in preparing Nunavut to adapt to climate change and reducing its greenhouse gas emissions, such as
- the Department of Community and Government Services, which manages government-owned property;
- the Nunavut Housing Corporation, which manages almost 7,000 public and staff housing units; and
- the Qulliq Energy Corporation, Nunavut’s public utility.
Focus of the audit
10. This audit focused on whether selected Government of Nunavut organizations took measures to prepare for and adapt to the impacts of climate change on Nunavut and took measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in Nunavut.
11. This audit is important because climate change is affecting the daily life, traditional activities, and infrastructure in Nunavut. The government needs to know what it has to do to help the people of Nunavut adapt and make the territory resilient to the impacts of climate change. Increasing energy efficiency and using more renewable energy help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the territory’s dependence on fossil fuels.
12. We examined whether the Government of Nunavut had
- developed a strategy for adapting to climate change and reducing greenhouse gas emissions,
- developed an implementation plan for the strategy,
- monitored and reported on the implementation of its strategy, and
- assessed climate change risks to Nunavut and Nunavummiut.
13. We also examined specific measures that selected government organizations had taken to adapt to climate change and reduce greenhouse gas emissions:
- the efforts of the Department of Community and Government Services and the Nunavut Housing Corporation to adapt to climate change; and
- the efforts of the Department of Community and Government Services, the Nunavut Housing Corporation, and the Qulliq Energy Corporation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
14. We did not examine the role of other Government of Nunavut departments or municipal governments in adapting to the impacts of climate change or in reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
15. In 2016, many legislative audit offices across Canada decided to look at the issue of climate change and developed similar audit approaches and questions to examine climate change action within their governments. As part of this initiative, the Office of the Auditor General of Canada decided to do federal and territorial climate change audits.
16. More details about the audit objective, scope, approach, and criteria are in About the Audit at the end of this report.
Findings, Recommendations, and Responses
Planning and preparing
Overall message
17. Overall, we found that the Government of Nunavut was not adequately prepared to respond to climate change. Although it had strategies for adapting to climate change and managing the territory’s energy use and greenhouse gas emissions, it did not have implementation plans that outlined how and when the objectives of the strategies would be met and who would be responsible for what. It also did not publicly report on its implementation of either strategy. We also found that the Government of Nunavut did not fully assess the risks of climate change to Nunavut.
18. These findings matter because implementation plans provide direction to departments so that they can respond in a coordinated manner to the risks and impacts of climate change. Public reporting informs Nunavummiut about the Government of Nunavut’s progress in addressing climate change and keeps it accountable. Assessing the risks of climate change ensures that the government has the information it needs to direct its actions and resources to the most important areas.
The Government of Nunavut had strategies for adapting to climate change and managing its energy use but lacked plans to implement them
19. We found that the Government of Nunavut had a strategy for responding to the impacts of climate change and a strategy for managing its energy use and reducing its reliance on fossil fuels and greenhouse gases. However, both strategies lacked clear and measurable commitments, and timelines. The government prepared draft implementation plans, which outlined the actions needed to achieve the objectives, along with timelines, deliverables, and responsibilities. However, these plans were never finalized.
20. We also found that the government did not set a target for reducing greenhouse gas emissions or publicly report on the implementation of both of its adaptation and energy strategies.
21. Our analysis supporting this finding presents what we examined and discusses the following topics:
22. This finding matters because strategies and implementation plans give departments direction on the priorities and actions they need to take to adapt to climate change and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Identifying who is responsible for taking action, the expected deliverables, and the related timelines are important for tracking progress and holding the Government of Nunavut accountable for results.
23. Reporting publicly on progress is important because it tells Nunavummiut what the government has done to address the impacts of climate change and to reduce the territory’s greenhouse gas emissions and its reliance on fossil fuels.
24. Our recommendation in this area of examination appears at paragraph 36.
25. What we examined. We examined whether the Government of Nunavut had a strategy and implementation plan for adapting to the impacts of climate change and reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and whether the government publicly reported on progress.
26. Adaptation strategy. In 2011, the Department of Environment released Upagiaqtavut: Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation in Nunavut, a framework for climate change adaptation initiatives in Nunavut. Its purpose is to provide strategic direction and enable Nunavummiut to better adapt to current and future changes brought on by climate change.
27. The strategy contained 11 objectives under 4 themes: partnership building, research and monitoring, education and outreach, and government policy and planning. We found that its objectives focused on actions to be taken, not on outcomes. The strategy did not explain who would be responsible for achieving the objectives and lacked timelines for completing actions.
28. The Government of Nunavut’s Cabinet directed the Department of Environment to work with all departments to develop a plan to implement the strategy. In 2014, the Department of Environment, with input from other departments, produced a five-year draft action plan, which outlined the actions to be taken to achieve the objectives, the timelines for completing these actions, the deliverables, and the responsibilities for completing the actions. We found that the draft action plan was never finalized.
29. Energy strategy. In 2007, the Government of Nunavut released Ikummatiit: The Government of Nunavut Energy Strategy. Covering the period from 2007 to 2020, the strategy aims to reduce Nunavut’s dependence on fossil fuels, improve energy security, and reduce air pollution and greenhouse gases. These objectives are to be achieved by, among other things, increasing energy efficiency and using alternatives to fossil fuels.
30. The strategy contains 42 policy actions designed to fulfill its objectives. We found that it did not state who was responsible for implementing about two thirds of the actions and did not set any timelines for completing actions.
31. After the release of the strategy, Cabinet directed the Energy Secretariat (at the time, located in the Department of Executive and Intergovernmental Affairs) to work with relevant departments to develop an implementation plan for the strategy. We found that, in 2010, the Secretariat produced a detailed draft plan, which included descriptions of how policy actions would be implemented, timelines, deliverables, and responsibilities; however, the plan was never finalized.
32. Monitoring and public reporting. We found that the monitoring of the adaptation and energy strategies was limited. Although both contained commitments to produce annual public reports, these were never produced. An interdepartmental climate change working group was established to coordinate implementation and public reporting for both strategies, but the group was inactive and had not met in many years.
Reduction targets for greenhouse gas emissions—Targets that can be absolute or intensity targets. Absolute targets refer to reducing greenhouse gas emissions over time. Intensity targets refer to reducing the ratio of greenhouse gas emissions over time relative to a particular measurement, such as per capita or gross domestic product (GDP). Both types of targets often have a base year and target year.
33. Reduction targets. We examined whether the Government of Nunavut had set reduction targets for greenhouse gas emissions and whether it was monitoring the territory’s emissions. Targets are important because they communicate what the government wants to achieve and act as a benchmark for measuring progress. Monitoring emissions helps determine whether progress is being made to reduce them.
34. We found that the government did not set targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions or other energy-related targets, such as how much power it wanted to produce using renewable energy. However, we did find that the Climate Change Secretariat was monitoring the territory’s greenhouse gas emissions. A report on energy use and greenhouse gas emission trends in the territory was produced for the Secretariat in early 2017. Department officials told us that they were reviewing the report and expected to use it to establish a comprehensive greenhouse gas inventory.
35. We noted differences between Nunavut’s estimated greenhouse gas emissions and those in Environment and Climate Change Canada’s 2017 national greenhouse gas emission inventory. Although both sources of information indicated that Nunavut’s emissions were increasing, they differed in terms of Nunavut’s total emissions and the share of emissions by sector (for example, transportation, heating, and electricity). Secretariat officials told us that they were investigating these differences and were participating in a federal/territorial working group to improve emission estimates for the territories.
36. Recommendation. The Department of Environment, in collaboration with other key departments, should develop an implementation plan for the Government of Nunavut’s climate change strategies that
- identifies priorities along with concrete actions, timelines, and costs;
- includes reduction targets for greenhouse gas emissions;
- clearly identifies roles and responsibilities, including who is responsible for overseeing the implementation of the plan and accountabilities for implementing actions; and
- requires monitoring and reporting on the plan’s progress.
The plan should consider actions taken to date and be informed by an assessment of climate change risks.
The Department of Environment’s response. Agreed. The Department of Environment, through the Climate Change Secretariat, will collaborate with other key departments to identify priorities, concrete actions, timelines, costs, and implementation plans for climate change strategies. These strategies aim to take action on Nunavut’s greenhouse gas emissions, reliance on diesel fuel, and role in adapting and combatting climate change.
The Climate Change Secretariat was formed in November 2016 and has since begun work on a variety of foundational projects that will well position the Department of Environment to facilitate responding to such a recommendation. Preliminary work on community energy planning, greenhouse gas emissions, and alternative energy inventories will support the Government of Nunavut’s ability to identify realistic and reasonable greenhouse gas emission targets.
The Government of Nunavut did not fully assess the risks of climate change
37. We found that the Government of Nunavut did not fully assess the risks of climate change to Nunavut and Nunavummiut. For example, it did not assess which communities might be at greatest risk, how climate change could affect the delivery of government programs and services, and the impacts of climate change on biodiversity. We found that the government did assess risks for selected topics, such as the risks of climate change to sources of drinking water in communities. For seven communities, it also produced maps that identified areas unsuitable for development due to risks from the thawing of permafrost.
38. Our analysis supporting this finding presents what we examined and discusses the following topic:
39. This finding matters because understanding the risks of climate change enables the Government of Nunavut to prioritize the steps it needs to take to ensure that Nunavut is resilient to the impacts of climate change. It also helps identify what steps need to be taken to ensure government services (such as the annual resupply of fuel to communities) and infrastructure (such as airports, health centres, and schools) are resilient to climate change. Identifying areas in communities at risk due to changes in permafrost helps local governments avoid developing in these areas.
40. Our recommendation in this area of examination appears at paragraph 49.
41. What we examined. We examined whether the Government of Nunavut had assessed the risks of climate change, including their impact and how likely they were to occur.
42. Assessing climate change risks. We found that the Government of Nunavut’s adaptation strategy identified the potential risks that climate change poses to Nunavut, including the potential impacts on current and future generations. However, it had not analyzed or ranked these risks in terms of their impacts and the likelihood that they would occur, nor had it assessed which communities and regions could be most affected by climate change.
43. The five-year draft action plan that was prepared for Nunavut’s adaptation strategy contained several proposed actions designed to better understand the risks of climate change, including the following to be led by the Department of Environment:
- assessing the risks of climate change to the government;
- developing tools to assess the costs and benefits of taking actions to adapt to climate change and the costs—environmental, economic, and social—of not acting; and
- identifying the impacts of climate change to biodiversity, including on hunting and traditional ways of life.
44. These are important steps to take to better understand the risks of climate change; however, we found that the Department of Environment did not follow through on these actions. Department officials noted difficulties in weighing and ranking one impact against another as a challenge to assessing risks.
45. We found that risks for selected topics were assessed. An assessment of climate change risks to Nunavut’s mining sector, including to infrastructure such as access roads, airstrips, and tailings (mining waste) facilities, was produced for the Department of Environment and other organizations. The Department also began to develop guidance for its staff on how to consider climate change during their reviews of environmental impact assessments of proposed projects. Climate change considerations could include the project’s greenhouse gas emissions and the potential impact of climate change on the proposed project.
46. We found that the Department of Community and Government Services, with support from the Department of Environment and other organizations, conducted a terrain mapping project to inform community planning and help identify areas unsuitable for development. The project produced maps for seven communities (Arviat, Baker Lake, Cape Dorset, Gjoa Haven, Kimmirut, Kugluktuk, and Pangnirtung). These maps identified areas at risk of instability due to changes in permafrost and other hazards, such as proximity to a body of water.
47. We also found that an assessment of the risks to primary sources of drinking water was prepared in 2017 for the Department of Community and Government Services and the Department of Health (Exhibit 2).
Exhibit 2—Primary sources of drinking water in some of Nunavut’s communities were identified as high risk
In 2017, a desktop risk assessment of primary sources of drinking water in Nunavut's communities (outside of Iqaluit) was completed for the Department of Community and Government Services and the Department of Health. The assessment considered a number of factors, including the size of the community's watershed, population growth, and future climate scenarios. The assessment identified six communities at high risk of water scarcity between 2016 and 2040, as a result of their watershed sizes, of growing water demands, and of climate change: Cambridge Bay, Cape Dorset, Clyde River, Igloolik, Rankin Inlet, and Taloyoak. According to Department of Community and Government Services officials, the results of the assessment were being used to determine next steps, including onsite research.
48. Finally, we found that the Department of Environment acted to increase awareness of the risks of climate change. It created the Nunavut Climate Change Centre, a web-based climate change resource to provide climate change information to Nunavummiut. The website includes an online database of information about permafrost. The Department also provided training to government officials on climate change.
49. Recommendation. The Department of Environment’s Climate Change Secretariat, in collaboration with other Government of Nunavut organizations, should analyze and rank the risks of climate change to Nunavut on the basis of their potential impacts and how likely they are to occur. Results of this analysis should be used to inform future climate change priorities and actions.
The Department of Environment’s response. Agreed. The Department of Environment intends to work with other Government of Nunavut organizations and external bodies to identify and rank climate change risks and hazards to Nunavut.
The Department of Environment will host a pan-northern meeting in March 2018 on permafrost hazard mapping. This will bring northern communities and government decision makers together to determine risks, opportunities, and recommendations to better manage and respond to permafrost thaw and other climate change risks. Best practices and lessons learned from this session will help inform future work conducted to address other identified risks. Additional work is scheduled to begin the development of climate change risk mitigation criteria for decision makers.
Taking action
Overall message
50. Overall, we found that the Department of Community and Government Services and the Nunavut Housing Corporation had measures to help protect buildings from the impacts of climate change on permafrost, but these measures were not fully implemented. These organizations and the Qulliq Energy Corporation did take steps to improve the energy efficiency of government assets, including government buildings in Iqaluit, public housing units, and power plants. However, the use of renewable energy, such as solar and wind, was limited due in part to high capital costs.
51. These findings matter because infrastructure can be protected from the impacts of climate change. Designing buildings with the potential impacts of climate change on permafrost in mind and assessing existing buildings and other infrastructure for potential problems from changing permafrost can reduce the risk of damage and the need for costly repairs. A government that owns energy-efficient assets and uses renewable energy sources can help reduce the demand for and dependence on fossil fuels, and the emissions of greenhouse gases. This can also support the government’s vision of self-reliant Nunavummiut and of Qanuqtuurniq—the Inuit societal value of being innovative and resourceful.
52. Climate change has caused air and ground temperatures in Canada’s north to increase, causing permafrost to warm. As permafrost warms, the ground can thaw, causing it to settle. Increased ground temperatures can also cause the active layer—the top layer of ground that freezes and thaws in permafrost zones—to deepen, increasing upward ground movement due to frost heave.
53. When ground settles and frost heave occurs, buildings on permafrost, such as schools, health centres, and public housing units, can shift and suffer distress or damage. This can include cracks in foundations and walls, uneven floors, doors and windows that do not close or seal properly, and leaks from supply or sewage lines, all of which can require repairs.
54. According to data collected by Natural Resources Canada at selected sites across Nunavut, permafrost temperatures increased between 2008 and 2014. With increased temperatures projected to occur because of climate change, warming of permafrost is expected to continue.
55. Putting skirting or piling snow around foundations can also degrade and thaw permafrost, because it insulates permafrost from cold air and allows the heat from the building to warm the permafrost below. Water that pools around buildings due to poor drainage or melting snow can also cause permafrost to degrade.
56. Canadian standards and technical guidance outline measures that can be taken to protect infrastructure from the impacts of degrading and thawing permafrost. These include the National Standard of Canada for Geotechnical Site Investigations for Building Foundations in Permafrost Zones (2017); the National Standard of Canada for Moderating the Effects of Permafrost Degradation on Existing Building Foundations (2014); and the Technical Guide—Infrastructure in Permafrost: A Guideline for Climate Change Adaptation (2010). These measures involve
- conducting geotechnical site investigations of planned building sites, which consider permafrost conditions and projected changes due to climate change (done before construction, these investigations are used to inform the design of foundations that are appropriate for the building site and are resilient to the impacts of climate change on permafrost over the life of the structure); and
- periodically inspecting and assessing buildings for signs of distress or damage due to ground settlement, frost heave, and permafrost degradation, and taking appropriate measures to avoid future damage, such as adjusting or levelling foundations.
57. Once the thawing of permafrost begins, stopping it is usually difficult and expensive. Therefore, it is essential to help preserve permafrost both beneath and beside a building. This can be achieved by implementing measures such as
- properly managing snow and drainage around buildings to avoid water from pooling (Exhibit 3), and
- ensuring spaces underneath buildings are properly ventilated to prevent permafrost from warming.
Exhibit 3—Ensuring proper drainage around facilities, such as the Leo Ussak School in Rankin Inlet, can help avoid water from pooling and reduce the risk of permafrost degradation

The Department of Community and Government Services and the Nunavut Housing Corporation had measures to safeguard government buildings from the impacts of climate change on permafrost, but these measures were not fully implemented
58. We found that the Department of Community and Government Services and the Nunavut Housing Corporation collected information on permafrost conditions through geotechnical site investigations to inform the design of their buildings and other infrastructure. Climate projections were considered in most of the cases we examined. We also found that both organizations did not always carry out building assessments as scheduled, which can help identify potential problems caused by changes in permafrost. Finally, we found that both organizations did not consistently incorporate measures into their operations and maintenance procedures for managing snow and water around buildings that could help prevent permafrost degradation.
59. Our analysis supporting this finding presents what we examined and discusses the following topics:
60. This finding matters because having measures in place to safeguard Nunavut’s buildings from changing permafrost conditions can prevent damage from occurring. Considering climate projections when conducting geotechnical site investigations helps ensure that building foundations are resilient to the potential impacts of climate change on permafrost. Periodically assessing existing buildings and proactively managing water and snow can help minimize and avoid damage and related repairs that can occur due to permafrost degradation and thaw.
61. Our recommendations in this area of examination appear at paragraphs 64, 71, 72, and 74.
62. What we examined. We examined whether the Department of Community and Government Services and the Nunavut Housing Corporation had
- conducted geotechnical site investigations for selected projects (seven infrastructure projects built by the Department of Community and Government Services and nine public housing units built by the Nunavut Housing Corporation) and considered climate projections in these investigations;
- assessed buildings (such as schools, health centres, and housing units) for signs of damage from thawing permafrost; and
- developed procedures to manage water and snow around their facilities to avoid permafrost degradation.
63. Geotechnical site investigations. We found that both the Department of Community and Government Services and the Nunavut Housing Corporation conducted geotechnical site investigations or used geotechnical information to inform the design and construction of infrastructure on permafrost. Climate projections were considered in six of the seven investigations conducted by the Department and five of the nine investigations conducted by the Corporation. Incorporating this type of information is important for ensuring that building foundations and other infrastructure are resilient to climate change.
64. Recommendation. The Department of Community and Government Services and the Nunavut Housing Corporation should ensure that climate change projections are incorporated into geotechnical site investigations where required.
The Department of Community and Government Services’ response. Agreed. The Department of Community and Government Services will initiate measures to ensure that climate change projections are incorporated into the geotechnical site investigations where required going forward.
The Nunavut Housing Corporation’s response. Agreed. The Nunavut Housing Corporation will incorporate climate change predictions into future geotechnical studies, where necessary.
65. Building assessments. We found that both the Department of Community and Government Services and the Nunavut Housing Corporation had procedures for assessing those parts of buildings, such as foundations, that could be affected by permafrost settlement and degradation. However, these assessments were not always carried out as scheduled. As a result, the Department and the Corporation may have missed signs of distress being caused by changing permafrost conditions and may have delayed steps that could have been taken to avoid or reduce damage.
66. The Department of Community and Government Services officials indicated that the Department conducts semi-annual and five-year building condition assessments as part of the management of its buildings. These assessments cover a range of building components, such as windows, ceilings, foundations, and pads that could be affected by changing permafrost conditions. The Regional Director, Infrastructure, is responsible for the semi-annual assessments, while the Department’s Technical Services is responsible for the more detailed five-year assessments.
67. Department officials indicated that semi-annual assessments were often done annually due to a lack of resources and to weather-related problems. According to documentation provided by the Department, semi-annual or annual assessments were done from October 2015 to October 2017 for buildings in the Kivalliq and Qikiqtaaluk regions except in Iqaluit and Rankin Inlet, where the buildings were not assessed. Government buildings under the Department’s responsibility were assessed in the Kitikmeot Region only in 2017. Buildings in Cambridge Bay were not assessed from October 2015 to October 2017. We found that the level of detail in the assessment reports that were completed varied; the assessments also did not always follow a standardized template, which could have helped ensure that all relevant aspects of a building, including structural aspects, were considered.
68. For detailed assessments, we found that a third party did five-year building condition assessments of government buildings in 2012. Since then, the Department put a new process in place requiring that a minimum number of buildings undergo a detailed assessment every year and that all assets be covered within a five-year period. We found, on the basis of data it provided, that the Department had completed detailed assessments for the buildings under its responsibility in 12 of Nunavut’s 25 communities at the end of October 2017. The Department planned to assess the remaining buildings by the end of 2019. As a result, buildings in selected communities will have gone up to almost seven years without a detailed assessment.
69. We also found that the Department required annual inspections of thermosyphons (a system used to keep a foundation and surrounding permafrost cold). We found that the inspection procedure for thermosyphons was not integrated into the electronic system used by the Department to manage its maintenance activities. As a result, these inspections were not taking place. During our audit, the Department took steps to address this issue. According to the Department, at least 3 of the 13 systems under its responsibility had experienced problems.
70. For the Nunavut Housing Corporation, we found that it required that its buildings undergo detailed condition rating assessments every two years. These assessments follow a standardized template that covers structural issues, such as building foundations that could be affected by changes to permafrost. We found, on the basis of data provided by the Corporation, that fewer than half (about 43%) of its public housing units underwent a condition rating assessment between October 2015 and October 2017. We noted that to strengthen its maintenance practices, the Corporation had recently increased the number of staff in its Territorial Maintenance Division and was planning to introduce a new system for managing its condition rating assessments.
71. Recommendation. The Department of Community and Government Services should standardize its building assessment procedures and complete its building assessments according to its required schedule.
The Department of Community and Government Services’ response. Agreed. The Department of Community and Government Services will work with all internal organizations to standardize its building assessment procedures and complete building assessments of Government of Nunavut infrastructure in the year scheduled.
72. Recommendation. The Nunavut Housing Corporation should ensure that it completes its condition rating assessments according to its schedule.
The Nunavut Housing Corporation’s response. Agreed. The Nunavut Housing Corporation will work with its Local Housing Organizations to ensure building condition ratings are completed according to schedule. The Corporation expects to implement a new building-condition software system in the 2018–19 fiscal year.
73. Snow and water management. We found that the operations and maintenance procedures followed by the Department of Community and Government Services and the Nunavut Housing Corporation did not fully reflect practices recommended in Canadian standards for managing snow and water around buildings, which can help prevent permafrost degradation. Municipal governments play an important role in managing snow and drainage in their communities, including around government facilities. It will be important to involve them in any discussions regarding snow and water management.
74. Recommendation. The Department of Community and Government Services and the Nunavut Housing Corporation should develop best practices for managing snow and water to prevent permafrost degradation for their owned buildings and incorporate these practices into their operations and maintenance procedures. Where applicable, the two organizations should involve municipal governments in the discussions on snow and water management.
The Department of Community and Government Services’ response. Agreed. The Department of Community and Government Services will work with stakeholders, specifically the Nunavut Association of Municipalities, to educate and support the municipalities in the development and use of best practices for managing snow and water to prevent permafrost degradation of infrastructure objects.
The Nunavut Housing Corporation’s response. Agreed. The Nunavut Housing Corporation will work with the Department of Community and Government Services and municipalities to improve the management of drainage and snow accumulation issues.
Selected Government of Nunavut organizations took steps to improve the energy efficiency of some of their assets but faced barriers to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and Nunavut’s dependence on fossil fuels
75. We found that the Qulliq Energy Corporation, the Department of Community and Government Services, and the Nunavut Housing Corporation acted to improve the energy efficiency of some assets, including power plants, government buildings in Iqaluit, and new public housing units. The Qulliq Energy Corporation and the Department of Community and Government Services also had some small renewable energy projects in place. There were, however, barriers to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and Nunavut’s dependence on fossil fuels.
76. Our analysis supporting this finding presents what we examined and discusses the following topics:
- Qulliq Energy Corporation
- Nunavut Housing Corporation
- Department of Community and Government Services
77. This finding matters because improving the energy efficiency of government-owned assets (such as power plants and buildings) and getting power from renewable energy sources can help reduce Nunavut’s demand for fossil fuels and greenhouse gas emissions.
78. Our recommendations in this area of examination appear at paragraphs 91, 99, 100, and 105.
79. What we examined. We examined whether the Qulliq Energy Corporation, the Department of Community and Government Services, and the Nunavut Housing Corporation took steps to improve energy efficiency and were using renewable energy to reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. We did not audit the costs and benefits associated with the various projects discussed in this section.
80. Qulliq Energy Corporation. The Qulliq Energy Corporation supplies electricity to each of Nunavut’s 25 communities through stand-alone diesel power plants and community distribution grids. In the 2015 to 2016 fiscal year, the Corporation established a goal to reduce its dependence on fossil fuels by 2% by 2019. The Corporation told us that it would achieve this through improved fuel efficiency.
81. We found that the Corporation replaced or upgraded several of its power plants and was maintaining and operating them more efficiently. According to the Corporation’s data, although its consumption of diesel fuel increased between the 2012 to 2013 and 2015 to 2016 fiscal years, the Corporation was producing more power per litre of diesel, a sign that the fuel efficiency of its power plants had improved.
82. The Corporation was also operating district heating systems. These systems capture residual heat generated through electricity production at power plants and distribute the heat to customers for heating buildings. Using residual heat helps reduce the use of heating fuels and the emissions of greenhouse gases.
83. We found that although there was infrastructure for these systems in 9 communities, the Corporation was supplying heat to customers in only 4—Iqaluit, Rankin Inlet, Arviat, and Kugluktuk. The system in Pangnirtung was temporarily not operating due to a fire at the community’s power plant. The other systems were no longer operating, but according to the Corporation, documentation on why was incomplete. The Corporation’s data showed that between January 2014 and December 2016, the four operating systems had on average
- reduced customer demand for heating fuels (and reduced associated greenhouse gas emissions) by an estimated 2 million litres annually, and
- generated about $1.8 million per year in revenues.
84. According to the Corporation, district heating systems can be costly to build and upgrade, and these costs were a barrier to further enhancing and expanding these systems in Nunavut. The Corporation was exploring federal funding opportunities to help overcome this barrier.
85. We also found that the Corporation had taken steps toward using renewable energy (Exhibit 4).
Exhibit 4—The Qulliq Energy Corporation was investigating the use of renewable energy
Solar power. In 2016, the Qulliq Energy Corporation installed a small demonstration project on solar energy at its Iqaluit power plant. According to the Corporation, the project improved its knowledge of how solar panels perform in the Arctic. In 2017, the Corporation assessed the costs and benefits of installing a 500-kilowatt solar energy project in Iqaluit. The project was estimated to cost almost $7.5 million and to reduce fuel consumption by an estimated 196,000 litres per year and greenhouse gas emissions by an estimated 615 tonnes per year.
Wind power. In 2016, a study produced for the Qulliq Energy Corporation identified five communities with the highest potential for harnessing wind resources (Arviat, Baker Lake, Iqaluit, Rankin Inlet, and Sanikiluaq). The study estimated that wind turbines could displace diesel use by about 18% to 56% in these communities and would cost about $4.2 million to $68.8 million to install.
Hydroelectric power. The Corporation investigated using hydroelectric power in Iqaluit, which, according to the Corporation, could reduce the Corporation’s annual fuel consumption by up to an estimated 30% and provide a meaningful reduction in the territory’s greenhouse gas emissions. Hydro generators are also less expensive to maintain than their diesel counterparts. In the 2013 to 2014 fiscal year, the initiative was suspended in part due to the large capital investment required (over $350 million in 2013).
86. We found that the Corporation was planning to implement a net-metering program that would encourage small-scale renewable energy projects. Under the program, customers who generate electricity (for example, using solar panels) can send unused power to the Corporation and receive a credit. By using renewable energy, customers reduce their demand for fossil fuels, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and save energy costs. The program was still being finalized at the time of our audit.
87. According to the Corporation, there were a number of barriers to large-scale renewable energy projects:
- high capital costs, including the cost of batteries to store power;
- the need to replace or upgrade aging power plants in 13 communities, which limited the Corporation’s capacity to invest in other areas;
- technical challenges, such as the icing of wind turbine blades; and
- the need to ensure that local power plants and transmission grids remain stable when receiving intermittent energy generated by third parties using renewable energy.
88. We found that the Corporation was taking steps to overcome the capital cost of large renewable energy projects by considering federal funding opportunities and third-party financing and operation of these projects.
89. We also found that the Corporation was working to have the Qulliq Energy Corporation Act amended so that it could purchase power from third parties. It was also developing an independent power producers policy, which would outline to third parties how the Corporation would integrate power from them. The Corporation identified the end of 2018 as a timeline for completing these actions.
90. We found that the Corporation reported the fuel efficiency of its diesel power plants annually; however, it did not compare it with past performance, making it difficult to interpret trends. We also found that the Corporation did not set targets on using alternative energy, such as how many litres of diesel it wants to reduce by using renewable energy, or the proportion of total energy it wants to generate using alternative sources. It would be important to have such targets to assess the Corporation’s performance and to frame its approach to renewable energy. In addition, although the Corporation had investigated a number of different renewable energy options, it had not identified which initiatives will be priorities.
91. Recommendation. The Qulliq Energy Corporation should establish priorities and targets for renewable energy (such as what share of its energy production it wants to come from renewable energy). Targets should have a baseline and timelines against which the Corporation can measure performance. Future reporting by the Corporation should include its progress on its priorities and performance against targets.
The Qulliq Energy Corporation’s response. Agreed. The Qulliq Energy Corporation will consult with the Government of Nunavut to determine the territory’s renewable energy objectives. Following the consultation phase, the Corporation will review territorial objectives within the context of the Corporation’s unique operating environment; set the appropriate priorities, targets, and timelines; and report accordingly. The Corporation anticipates that the deployment of renewable energy technology will be impacted by the Corporation’s small rate base, along with financial, geographical, and technical challenges. These factors will need to be reconciled with the Corporation’s primary objective of delivering reliable and affordable energy in an Arctic setting.
92. Nunavut Housing Corporation. We examined measures the Nunavut Housing Corporation took to improve the energy efficiency of new public housing units. We found that the Corporation had installed energy-efficient lighting, appliances, and boilers into its new public housing units. It had also included improved insulation and energy-efficient windows in its new units to make them airtight and reduce heat loss. According to the results of a desktop evaluation, these new units exceeded the energy-efficiency requirements of the National Building Code of Canada. Although the Corporation did not have any renewable energy projects, it had plans to install a small-scale solar panel project in Baker Lake to understand its potential energy performance and maintenance requirements.
93. According to an analysis done by the Corporation, selected housing units built between 2006 and 2012 used from 10 to 13% less fuel (savings of about $600 in fuel costs) per unit per year compared with older units built in the 1980s and 1990s. However, the Corporation’s data indicated that per-unit costs for fuel and electricity increased between the 2011 to 2012 and 2016 to 2017 fiscal years.
94. We found that the Corporation did not have information on how the efficiency measures it introduced had performed. In 2017, the Corporation hired a financial analyst to analyze its fuel and electricity use, including consumption trends. According to the Corporation, an Energy Initiatives Coordinator position was created in 2015 to ensure that energy efficiency was maintained and improved for public housing units. However, the position was not filled.
95. We found that the Corporation did not set targets for reducing fuel and electricity use, nor did it report on trends in its fuel and electricity use. Setting a target and reporting on trends is important for assessing the impact that the Corporation’s energy-efficiency measures are having.
96. We also examined the Corporation’s maintenance of heat recovery ventilators (HRVs) in its public housing units. Because energy-efficient homes are designed to be airtight, with limited air circulation, HRVs are used to replace indoor air with fresh outdoor air. They help ensure good indoor air quality, control humidity, and avoid moisture build up, which can contribute to mold.
97. The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation commissioned a study on HRVs in northern Canada. Released in 2017, the study identified problems with installing, operating, and maintaining HRVs. These issues, along with the lack of HRVs in some housing units, were identified as potential reasons behind the presence of mold in some of the Nunavut Housing Corporation’s public housing units.
98. According to the Nunavut Housing Corporation, it has HRV units in 2,181 of its public housing units across the territory and requires all new public units to have HRVs. We found that it was not carrying out maintenance of its HRVs as required by its procedures. According to the Corporation’s data, 18% of the HRVs in its public housing units received required annual inspections and servicing during the 2016 to 2017 fiscal year. In 15 communities, none of the HRVs received annual maintenance. We noted that the Corporation was assessing options on how to improve its inspection and maintenance of HRVs.
99. Recommendation. The Nunavut Housing Corporation should set targets for fuel and electricity savings. Future reporting should include how fuel and electricity use has changed over time and discuss how the Corporation performed against its targets.
The Nunavut’s Housing Corporation’s response. Agreed. The Nunavut Housing Corporation plans to evaluate fuel and electrical consumption to identify areas offering potential savings based on any available funding specifically allocated for energy retrofits. Targets and future reporting will be informed by the results of this work, with the understanding that prioritization of this work will be dependent on Government of Nunavut mandates and the direction of the Corporation’s Board of Directors. The Corporation will comply with codes related to building design and energy efficiency in a northern climate.
100. Recommendation. The Nunavut Housing Corporation should take appropriate steps to ensure that heat recovery ventilators (HRVs) are maintained as required under its maintenance program.
The Nunavut Housing Corporation’s response. Agreed. The Nunavut Housing Corporation will ensure maintenance programs related to heat recovery ventilators (HRVs) are implemented according to schedule.
101. Department of Community and Government Services. We examined the Nunavut Energy Management Program of the Department of Community and Government Services. The program uses private-sector firms to conduct energy retrofits to government buildings, using future energy savings to repay the cost of the retrofits. The program set two objectives: a 20% reduction in energy consumption and an associated reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.
102. The program began in the 2008 to 2009 fiscal year with a pilot project in Iqaluit to retrofit 37 Government of Nunavut buildings. This included replacing existing interior and exterior lighting with new energy-efficient lights and fixtures; and installing heat-recovery systems, solar hot-water heating systems (Exhibit 5), and solar walls for air pre-heating.

103. According to the Department, the Iqaluit project cost $12.8 million and led to more than $1.8 million per year in savings in utility costs (including water, fuel, and electricity). It also reduced greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 2,090 tonnes per year. In mid-2017, the Department received approval to expand the program to the Kivalliq Region.
104. We found that the Department of Community and Government Services reported on the Iqaluit pilot project on its website. However, its reporting on the project’s costs and energy savings did not reflect current internal data and did not include reporting on estimated greenhouse gas reductions.
105. Recommendation. The Department of Community and Government Services should ensure that its public reporting on the Nunavut Energy Management Program is up to date.
The Department of Community and Government Services’ response. Agreed. The Department of Community and Government Services will endeavour to ensure that information pertaining to the Nunavut Energy Management Program is up to date on the Department’s website.
Conclusion
106. We concluded that the Government of Nunavut had a strategy for adapting to climate change, which considered potential changes and impacts on current and future generations. The government also had an energy strategy, which included policy actions aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. However, both strategies lacked plans that outlined how the strategies would be implemented and who would be responsible for what. The government had also not fully assessed the risks of climate change to Nunavut.
107. We also concluded that selected Government of Nunavut organizations had measures to safeguard government buildings from the impacts of climate change on permafrost, but these measures were not fully implemented. Selected government organizations took steps to make government assets more energy efficient. However, there were a number of barriers to implementing alternatives to fossil fuels, which would help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the territory’s reliance on fossil fuels.
About the Audit
This independent assurance report was prepared by the Office of the Auditor General of Canada on the response to climate change in Nunavut by the Department of Environment, the Department of Community and Government Services, the Nunavut Housing Corporation, and the Qulliq Energy Corporation. Our responsibility was to provide objective information, advice, and assurance to assist the Legislative Assembly in its scrutiny of the government’s management of resources and programs, and to conclude on whether selected departments’ implementation of climate change measures complied in all significant respects with the applicable criteria.
All work in this audit was performed to a reasonable level of assurance in accordance with the Canadian Standard for Assurance Engagements (CSAE) 3001—Direct Engagements set out by the Chartered Professional Accountants of Canada (CPA Canada) in the CPA Canada Handbook—Assurance.
The Office applies Canadian Standard on Quality Control 1 and, accordingly, maintains a comprehensive system of quality control, including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards, and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.
In conducting the audit work, we have complied with the independence and other ethical requirements of the relevant rules of professional conduct applicable to the practice of public accounting in Canada, which are founded on fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care, confidentiality, and professional behaviour.
In accordance with our regular audit process, we obtained the following from entity management:
- confirmation of management’s responsibility for the subject under audit;
- acknowledgement of the suitability of the criteria used in the audit;
- confirmation that all known information that has been requested, or that could affect the findings or audit conclusion, has been provided; and
- confirmation that the audit report is factually based.
Audit objective
The objective of this audit was to determine whether selected Government of Nunavut organizations took measures to reduce the territory’s emissions of greenhouse gases and to adapt to climate change impacts, taking into account these impacts on current and future generations.
Scope and approach
In the 2016 to 2017 fiscal year, many legislative audit offices across Canada decided to look at the issue of climate change and developed similar audit approaches and questions to examine climate change action within their governments. As part of this initiative, the Office of the Auditor General of Canada decided to do climate change audits of all territories.
We examined whether the Government of Nunavut had a strategy and action plan in place for adapting to climate change and reducing greenhouse gas emissions; whether it was monitoring and reporting on progress made in implementing its strategy; and whether it had assessed the risks of climate change. This part of the audit focused primarily on the Department of Environment.
We also examined specific measures that the Department of Community and Government Services, the Nunavut Housing Corporation, and the Qulliq Energy Corporation took to reduce Nunavut’s greenhouse gas emissions and its dependence on fossil fuels, through energy-efficiency improvements and renewable energy initiatives.
We also examined specific adaptation efforts of the Department of Community and Government Services, and the Nunavut Housing Corporation. In particular, we examined whether permafrost changes that can occur due to climate change were considered to inform the design of infrastructure and during the assessment of buildings (for example, schools, health centres, and housing units).
The audit involved reviewing and analyzing documents, interviews, and site visits. Department officials were interviewed as well as community stakeholders and representatives of local governments. We conducted field work in Iqaluit and in a select number of communities.
We did not examine the role of other Government of Nunavut departments, such as the Department of Finance, the Department of Executive and Intergovernmental Affairs, and the Department of Economic Development and Transportation, or municipal governments.

Dec 07, 2018, 10:08 ET
OTTAWA, Dec. 7, 2018 /CNW/ - Protecting the marine environment and all users of Canada's oceans and waterways is of paramount importance. That is why the Government of Canada, under the Oceans Protection Plan, is taking action to make Arctic resupply operations faster, safer, and more efficient for remote communities.
Transport Canada is assisting the Government of Nunavut to deliver marine safety infrastructure across the territory by providing funding to two projects. Transport Canada will contribute:
- $2,545,200 to help construct two 70-tonne mooring bollards for safer refuelling operations in each of five Nunavut communities. Fuel in Nunavut is delivered by tanker and is discharged through floating hoses to fixed manifolds connected to the community's tank farm. To safely undertake this type of operation, it is imperative to have multiple secure mooring points, including shoreline bollards.
- $2,185,000 to undertake a comprehensive community scoping study. Through community consultations, formal options development, physical site assessments, and selection of priority projects based on identified needs, this study will directly inform the practical implementation of essential marine infrastructure projects across Nunavut.
These investments are part of the $94.3 million Safety Equipment and Basic Marine Infrastructure in Northern Communities initiative under the Oceans Protection Plan. The initiative helps Northerners protect their communities and livelihoods with a marine safety system that is better positioned to prevent and respond to marine safety and pollution incidents.
The $1.5 billion Oceans Protection Plan is the largest investment ever made to protect Canada's coasts and waterways. Through this plan, the Government of Canada is creating a world-leading marine safety system that provides economic opportunities for Canadians today, while protecting our coasts and waterways for generations to come. This work is being done in close collaboration with Inuit and Indigenous peoples, local stakeholders and northern communities.

Climate change has been identified as compromising food security in many case studies with Inuit communities in Canada. Largely neglected in the scholarship however, is research focusing on the gendered dimensions of Inuit food security in a changing climate. This paper reports on a community based participatory research project involving semi-structured interviews with Inuit women (n = 42), 10 focus groups (n = 40), key informant interviews (n = 8), and participant observation, to identify and characterise the determinants of food security among Inuit females in the community of Arviat, and examine the role played by climate and climate change. Results indicate that significant changes in climate being observed are not currently affecting female food security, with socio-economic-cultural factors primary determinants of food security. The nature of the traditional food system in Arviat based on harvesting land mammals reduces sensitivity to changing sea ice conditions which have been problematic in other Inuit communities. However, dependence on a limited number of animals for diet (primarily caribou, arctic char) increases sensitivity to potential future disruptions caused by climate change to these species and reduces response diversity as a coping mechanism.

Historical records are valuable for assessing glacier change in the Canadian High Arctic. Ommanney’s (1969) detailed inventory of Axel Heiberg Island glaciers, based on photography from 1958–59, has been revisited, converted into digital format and compared to glacier extents mapped from 1999–2000 satellite imagery. Our results show that the island-wide ice coverage decreased by 15.92 km2 in the 42 year period, a loss of <1%. However, two trends are apparent: one of advance or minor retreat from basins hosting outlet glaciers from Müller and Steacie Ice Caps, and one of significant retreat, on the order of 50–80%, for independent ice masses, which include valley glaciers, mountain glaciers, glacierets, and ice caps smaller than 25 km2. If the contributions to ice advance of only three surging glaciers are removed, then the island-wide ice loss approaches 60 km2. Furthermore, it is notable that 90% of ice masses smaller than 0.2 km2 disappeared entirely during the 42 year study period, an observation confirmed by field studies. Successful predictions from the original inventory are highlighted and the likely mechanisms driving the observed advances and retreats are discussed.
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (Reference SolomonSolomon and others, 2007) concluded that the Arctic is particularly susceptible to the effects of global warming. This has been conclusively demonstrated by rapid changes in the extent and nature of the Arctic Ocean ice cover (Reference Nghiem, Rigor, Perovich, Clemente-Colón, Weatherly and NeumannNghiem and others, 2007; Reference Perovich, Kwok, Meier, Nghiem and Richter-MengePerovich and others, 2010; Reference WitzeWitze, 2010) and the extent and volume of ice caps in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, which are estimated to have lost 635.8 km3 between 1959 and 1999 (Reference Sharp, Copland, Filbert, Burgess and WilliamsonSharp and others, 2003).
Glaciers are particularly useful indicators of changes in climate, hence the renewed emphasis on the compilation of glacier inventories around the world to aid in our understanding of how climate is changing (Reference Haeberli, Cihlar and BarryHaeberli and others, 2000; Reference CogleyCogley, 2009; Reference OhmuraOhmura, 2009) and the likely impact on sea level.
Although a world glacier inventory had been proposed for the first International Geophysical Year (1958), there had been little international coordination until a similar project was proposed for the International Hydrological Decade (IHD; 1965–74). Raymond Nace, considered by many to be the father of the IHD, in calling for global inventories, explained the situation as follows:
‘considerable difference of opinion prevails about whether the ice masses are growing, shrinking or merely being maintained. It is important that this be determined because the ice areas are great weather factories and their melting would cause a rise of sea level.’ (Reference NaceNace, 1969, p.32)
The International Commission on Snow and Ice rose to the challenge of the IHD, and appointed committees to develop guidelines for assessing the attributes of various elements of the cryosphere. Those related to a global inventory of perennial snow and ice masses were developed under the direction of Fritz Müller at McGill University, Montréal, Canada, and published by UNESCO/International Association of Scientific Hydrology (IASH) (1970). The first to be completed for a substantial area using the new guidelines was that for Axel Heiberg Island (AHI) (Reference OmmanneyOmmanney, 1969). This comprehensive inventory presents an opportunity for assessing glacier changes over a 42 year period for part of the Canadian High Arctic by comparing it with a subsequent inventory compiled as part of a Global Land Ice Measurements from Space (GLIMS) project (Reference BishopBishop and others, 2004).
Reference OmmanneyOmmanney (2009) has recently described the background to the AHI inventory and the Canadian inventory program. There were a number of reasons for the selection of this area for a test of the guidelines in Canada:
‘Although it might have seemed more appropriate to carry out a pilot study of this nature in an area of greater human and economic importance it was necessary that the recommendations be tested in one of the least favourable areas so that the success there would prove the general applicability and suitability of the proposals and ensure that the study could be carried out for all glacierized areas in the country.’ (Reference OmmanneyOmmanney, 1969, p.25)
In addition to the remoteness of the island, AHI provided a landscape with varying degrees of ice coverage and a wide range of glacier types, with 55% of the area being attributed to outlet glaciers, 26% to valley, mountain and other independently sourced glaciers, 16% to ice caps and 3% to ice fields (Reference OmmanneyOmmanney, 1969). As in many other glacierized regions on Earth, the mapping of ice extents required remote-sensing methods using aerial photographs. Given that air photos were available from the late 1940s, the early 1950s and 1958–59, and that 1:250 000 Canadian National Topographic Series (NTS) maps were being prepared, the materials required for the proposed inventory were available. AHI was also chosen so that the fundamental information on the ice cover of the island would complement the work of the glaciologists and physical scientists who started working there in 1959, under the auspices of the Jacobsen–McGill University Arctic Research Expedition, led by Fritz Müller, and who have continued working there to the present using the McGill Arctic Research Station. While the basic inventory focused on one date, 1959, the resulting catalogue provides a structure for comparing earlier and subsequent glacier records and observations, creating a legacy for future generations (Reference Ommanney and AdamsOmmanney, 1987a, Reference Ommanney and Adamsb; Reference Ecclestone, Cogley, Adams, Taylor, Hardy and PomeroyEcclestone and others, 2000; Reference Cogley, Adams and EcclestoneCogley and others, 2011), and for all the researchers who continue to study the glaciers of the island.
To enable regional assessment in the original inventory (Reference OmmanneyOmmanney, 1969), AHI was divided into five principal hydrological basins, designated 46441–46445, which were then subdivided into lesser-order basins identified by letters (Fig. 1a). Glacier outlines were compiled at a scale of 1 :125 000 on advanced prints of the eleven 1 :250 000 NTS maps developed from 1958 and 1959 Canadian Government aerial photography. In this process, ice masses measuring 0.1–2.6 km2 were added to the inventory. Glacier areas were calculated using a Bruning Areagraph random dot overlay and a mechanical dot counter, noted as having a >97% precision (Reference OmmanneyOmmanney, 1969). The original and uncorrected NTS extents are available from Geomatics Canada and were used by Reference Sharp, Copland, Filbert, Burgess and WilliamsonSharp and others (2003) in their assessment of area and volume change of ice caps in the Canadian Arctic. As most survey lines were flown in 1959, we refer to the baseline inventory by this date for brevity. In developing the baseline inventory for AHI, Ommanney used air photos taken by the Royal Canadian Air Force in 1958 from an altitude of 30 000 ft (9144 m), and stereophotogrammetric methods to check and improve the glacier boundaries of the NTS. Features down to 0.01 km2 were included following checks against earlier trimetrogon photography, taken in 1950 and 1952, and against the more limited vertical air-photo coverage from the US Army–Air Force task force ‘Operation Polaris’ in 1947; a process which revealed the perennial nature of these small ice patches.
The 1120 glaciers (including 12 rock glaciers) in the baseline inventory were identified sequentially according to region, basin and number, then assigned a single set of geographic and Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates and attributes such as aspect, elevation, area and volume. Following the UNESCO/IASH (1970) manual for the World Glacier Inventory, a six-digit code that identified the qualitative characteristics of each glacier was also assigned (Table 1). The ice masses and rock glaciers identified covered a combined total area of 11 734.9 km2 (Reference OmmanneyOmmanney, 1969). The difference between this value and the 11 978 km2 reported by Reference Sharp, Copland, Filbert, Burgess and WilliamsonSharp and others (2003) from NTS extents can be attributed to the corrections of these extents made by Reference OmmanneyOmmanney (1969).
The second inventory of glaciers in this study utilizes the Global Land Ice Measurements from Space (GLIMS) database, the extents of which were originally delineated using Landsat 7 scenes from 1999 and 2000 over AHI. The precision required of GLIMS data is 0.001 km2 with a minimum glacier size of 0.01 km2 from clear Landsat 7 scenes (15 m spatial resolution) (Reference PaulPaul and others, 2010). The GLIMS dataset delineates not only terminus extents and margins, but also individual glacier catchments in the upper reaches of ice fields where accumulation areas are adjacent (outlined according to the ice-flow regime). This information, though extremely beneficial for individual glacier assessment, unfortunately cannot be used in this study because glacier outlines are not available from the baseline inventory. Instead, all glaciers from the GLIMS inventory were first combined as a single feature and subsequently divided according to the regions and basins of the baseline inventory. Thus, the two datasets can be compared without discrepancies associated with differing accumulation-area boundaries. The smallest ice mass identified in the GLIMS inventory of AHI glaciers measures 0.04 km2.
Some pre-processing was required as, in their original format, the two inventories were not directly comparable. First, the boundaries of the regions and basins were manually delineated from scanned versions of the baseline inventory maps (Reference OmmanneyOmmanney, 1969) using the Environmental Systems Research Institute’s (ESRI) ArcGIS software and projected to fit zone 14-north of the UTM projection using the North American Datum 1983 (NAD83). On these maps, points identifying each glacier were plotted, the glacier characteristics from the Reference OmmanneyOmmanney (1969) report were entered as point-associated attributes to include the orientation (accumulation and ablation areas), mean elevations (accumulation and ablation areas), accumulation–area ratio (AAR), depth and volume, and the six-digit classification was recorded (Table 1).
To verify that the inventory data entered remained true through the data entry process, the attributes of the five largest and five smallest glaciers (in area) were checked in each basin, as well as three glaciers selected randomly from within the basin. Following these attribute checks, which suggested a 0.3% error in data entry (13/4654), a final comparison found the area sum of each basin in the digital inventory to match the area sums reported in the baseline inventory. The greatest discrepancies between the two inventories can be attributed to the removal of 12 rock glaciers from the dataset, as they are not considered to contribute to ice coverage in the GLIMS inventory.
Finally, to minimize inconsistencies between the two inventories, and to ease the task of cataloguing and temporally comparing hundreds of glaciers, ice coverage for both inventories was assessed according to the five geographic regions and lesser-order basins of the baseline inventory, rather than on a glacier-by-glacier basis.
Our comparison of the extent of ice coverage between 1959 and 2000 is summarized in Figure 1b. Changes in ice coverage are noted as a percentage of the 1959 area, such that a value of −4 (e.g. area 46444a) indicates that 96% of 1959 ice extent remains.
The island-wide ice coverage in the year 2000 inventory (11 709.3 km2) is only 15.92 km2 less than the 1959 extent of 1172 5.22 km2 (without rock glacier contributions). This loss of <1 % during the 42 year period was unexpected considering consistent reports of ice loss from other glacierized areas in the Arctic (Reference Sharp, Copland, Filbert, Burgess and WilliamsonSharp and others, 2003; Reference SolomonSolomon and others, 2007; Reference Andreassen, Paul, Kääb and HausbergAndreassen and others, 2008). Further analysis reveals, however, that there are two distinct trends in the response of glaciers on AHI and that simply measuring and comparing the areas observed from the two inventories does not provide a complete picture. In the following discussion of results, we highlight the occurrence and distribution of the dominant trend, glacier recession, and discuss a mechanism for the sparse, yet marked, occurrence of glacier growth in regions dominated by outlet glaciers of Müller Ice Cap (MIC).
First, let us compare Reference OmmanneyOmmanney’s (1969) assessments of glacier terminus behaviour, these being retreat, advance or surge characteristics (according to the classification table of the baseline inventory), with the distribution, sign and magnitude of area changes measured between 1959 and 2000. Figure 2a illustrates the frequency of these glacier characteristics for each region and basin and shows that retreating glaciers overwhelmingly dominate glacier populations in all regions and basins. Of the 1108 glaciers listed in the baseline inventory, 90.5% showed retreating characteristics, while 2.9% were stationary and 5.7% were advancing. The remaining glaciers were either unclassified or listed as potential surge-type glaciers, which we discuss later. Though retreating glaciers were the most common glacier type observed in 1959, the contribution of these ice masses to overall area loss was masked by that of the less common, though significantly larger, advancing glaciers (Fig. 2b and c, respectively).
The eight basins exhibiting an increase in ice coverage are all located in region 46444. Of these, five are dominated by glaciers with accumulation areas fed by MIC: Strand Fiord (d), Expedition Fiord (e), Iceberg Bay (f), Middle Fiord (g) and Skaare Fiord (m). The greatest growth was observed in the Iceberg Bay basin, where the ice cover increased by 77.81 km2. Growth was observed to a lesser extent along the eastern rim of MIC in Li Fiord (h), Bunde Fiord (j) and the eastern Schei Peninsula (l). When considering island-wide change, these increases are significant enough to counterbalance losses observed more generally across the island, resulting in the small island-wide change in ice coverage.
Reference OmmanneyOmmanney’s (1969) observations of advancing termini (Fig. 2) primarily related to those basins centred on the two largest ice bodies, MIC (region 46444) and Steacie Ice Cap (SIC; 46441), where glaciers he identified as advancing and stationary comprised most of the ice cover and were clearly larger on average (Fig. 2c). However, despite the contributions of advance-categorized glaciers to SIC, this region exhibited shrinkage on the order of ∼180 km2 from 1959 to 2000, the nature of which is discussed immediately below. Considering the regional and basin-specific results from this study (noted above each column in Fig. 2), recent observations of growth from some of the MIC basins suggest that the advance of some of the glacier termini continues.
In a survey across the Canadian Arctic of 51 glaciers exhibiting surge characteristics, three glaciers of western AHI (‘Good Friday Bay Glacier’, Iceberg Glacier and ‘Middle or Airdrop Glacier’) show the most dramatic surge activity (Reference Copland, Sharp and DowdeswellCopland and others, 2003). Two of the three surge-type glaciers identified on AHI in the Reference Copland, Sharp and DowdeswellCopland and others (2003) study, Iceberg Glacier and ‘Middle or Airdrop Glacier’, are in basins where ice coverage has increased since 1959. Though these three surge-type glaciers alone added 85.45 km2 of ice to the 2000 inventory, these advances should not be misinterpreted as positive mass balance. Thus, if we subtract the contribution of these three surging glaciers the island-wide shrinkage quadruples from ∼15 to ∼60 km2. In the case of the Iceberg Bay and Middle Fiord glaciers, surges were responsible for one-third of the area gain in ice cover for their basins (46444F and 46444G). Adjusting to account for surging-glacier contributions, the 46444F basin advance changes from 6.9% of the 1959 coverage to 5%, and that for basin 46444G from 8.1% to 5.6%. For ‘Good Friday Bay Glacier’, which is an outlet of SIC, the corrected results for this retreating basin increase from 3.8% ice loss to 6%.
While not all advance observed in basins of MIC can be explained by confirmed surge activity, numerous recent studies suggest that our understanding of climate-driven changes linked to ice coverage is incomplete and that ice dynamics are both skewing and underestimating regional observations of ice loss (Reference Kaser, Cogley, Dyurgerov, Meier and OhmuraKaser and others, 2006; Reference Rignot and KanagaratnamRignot and Kanagaratnam, 2006; Reference BellBell, 2008). For Thompson Glacier of Expedition Fiord (46444e), Reference Cogley, Adams and EcclestoneCogley and others (2011) suggest that, in light of the findings of Reference Copland, Sharp and DowdeswellCopland and others (2003) and the distorted medial moraine characteristics, the glacier’s advance prior to 2000 may have been exhibiting ‘slow-surge’ characteristics. We speculate that growth in other glacier basins on western AHI might similarly be attributed to the dynamic processes of increased ice velocity leading to a redistribution of ice from the higher elevations of MIC to the major outlet-glacier tongues at the margins. This conjecture, however, will require future remote-sensing and in situ studies of AHI glaciers to assess any reductions in ice thickness of MIC, specifically in the accumulation areas of the large outlet glaciers. Contemporaneous with dynamic processes, it is possible that glacier growth from MIC can be attributed to the longer response time of large outlet glaciers to the positive mass-balance conditions during the Little Ice Age (Reference Cogley, Adams and EcclestoneCogley and others, 2011). It is likely that this process can explain why the smaller and thinner White Glacier has been exhibiting retreat alongside the previously advancing Thompson Glacier. The fact that the advance of Thompson has now stopped suggests that non-surging outlets from MIC will henceforth exhibit retreat as has been observed for most of the island’s other glaciers.
As illustrated in Figure 1b, regions dominated by outlet glaciers from the two major ice bodies on the island, SIC and MIC, have shown expansion or lesser shrinkage. Although Figure 2b shows that growing and stationary glaciers represented most of the ice cover in the SIC (46441) region during the 1950s, the measured 186.88 km2 of ice loss in 2000 suggests that either the advance of glacier termini has stopped since the 1950s, or the rate of advance has decreased and previously stationary glaciers have begun to retreat. Although the nature of our datasets precludes glacier-by-glacier analysis, we have been able to assess the relative changes in larger outlet and valley glaciers in basins hosting both.
By delineating divisions between ice-cap-derived and independent glaciers, we can assess the state of individual ice masses separately from the coalescent ice fields. We used this method to determine whether the outlet glaciers of the SIC region (46441), considered together, have been advancing, en masse. Figure 3 shows the division between SIC-derived glaciers and independent glaciers, and documents ice losses between 1959 and 2000. It is clear that all glaciers in the region have experienced ice loss, but that the losses experienced by independent glaciers are ∼30% greater than those of the SIC-derived glaciers.
Across AHI, regions dominated by small glaciers identified as retreating in the 1950s have since shown a dramatic degree of ice loss. Small ice caps, cirque glaciers, mountain glaciers, ice aprons and glacierets persist as the primary glacier types along the western and northern peninsulas of AHI (regions 46442 and 46443). These are the regions where Reference OmmanneyOmmanney (1969) reported the highest number of retreat-type glaciers and where the smallest glaciers on the island are concentrated (Fig. 2). In these two regions, 992.89 km2 of ice has been lost since 1959, activity consistent with the abundance of retreat classifications assigned in the baseline inventory. Two-thirds of all glaciers in these regions are independent, i.e. they are not outlet glaciers of the few small ice caps. The higher ice losses measured in these regions can be attributed mainly to the small glacier sizes, most being <0.5 km2. Region 46445, which exhibited the greatest percentage ice loss of all the regions on the island, was the one with the least ice cover in 1959 (8.82 km2). By 2000, glacier coverage had dropped to 3.21 km2, and four of the seven glaciers identified in 1959 had disappeared. The 64% loss observed here may be representative of the response that can be expected generally from remnant and isolated glaciers.
Across the island, observations of significant retreat consistently coincide with higher numbers of these small, remnant glaciers, and glaciers at lower elevations (Fig. 4). The Pearson correlation coefficients between area fluctuations (1959–2000), glacier area (1959) and the average accumulation-area elevation (1959) are r = 0.477 (P(r = 0) = 0.0103) and r = 0.425 (P(r = 0) = 0.0241), respectively. Unfortunately, we are unable to derive equilibrium-line elevations using the example set by Reference Braithwaite and RaperBraithwaite and Raper (2009), as the baseline inventory reports the average accumulation-area elevation and the average ablation-area elevation, rather than the maximum and minimum glacier elevations required. However, Figure 5 maintains that small glaciers and those below elevations of ∼1100 m are particularly susceptible to rises in the freezing level associated with a warming climate, which agrees with the findings of Reference Braun, Hardy and BradleyBraun and others (2004) and Reference Dyurgerov, Meier, Bamber and PayneDyurgerov and Meier (2004). If current climatic trends on AHI persist or intensify, substantial additional retreat can be expected here.
Island-wide, 294 glaciers that were mapped in the baseline inventory were not identified in the GLIMS inventory. Initially, it appeared that these glacierets and mountain glaciers could account for the loss of 146.04 km2 of ice if all 294 glaciers were indeed missing. Though these glaciers only represented 1.25% of the ice coverage in 1959, this is still a significant finding given that it suggests that 26% of the glaciers identified by Reference OmmanneyOmmanney (1969) are no longer present. Figure 5 illustrates some of the glaciers identified in the baseline inventory that could not be identified in satellite imagery from the year 2000 for the GLIMS inventory. These losses were noted mainly in regions 46442 and 46443. In region 46442, one-third (53/152) of the glaciers from the 1959 inventory were not recorded in the 2000 inventory. In region 46443, only 47% of glaciers remain (75/158).
Are all these glaciers truly ‘missing’? Discrepancies between the two inventories may be attributed to conflicting notions of how large ice masses must be to be considered glaciers and, compared to aerial photography, the lower-resolution satellite imagery may create an artificial bias against the detection of small ice masses in the GLIMS inventory. To determine whether these ‘missing’ glaciers have indeed disappeared in the past 50 years, we visited 23 sites of the identified features in summer 2009. Of these, 13 sites had no ice and were deemed to have truly disappeared at some time during the past 50 years (e.g. Fig. 5a). Six sites had ice which was insubstantial in thickness and extent, with entirely bare ice indicating the lack of an accumulation area (e.g. Fig. 5b). The ice in the remaining 4 sites was substantial enough to be mapped as glaciers, but displayed insubstantial accumulation areas and significantly smaller area coverage than observed in the 1959 aerial photographs (e.g. Fig. 5c). With these proportions in mind, it is more likely that the loss of ∼82.5 km2 of ice can be attributed to the disappearance of ∼165 glaciers, and that the remaining ∼128 glaciers from the baseline inventory that went undetected in the GLIMS inventory have shrunk to less than 0.04 km2 (the smallest ice area detected in the GLIMS inventory). As GLIMS methodology states a lower area limit for catalogued glaciers of 0.01 km2 and a precision of 0.001 km2, we interpret the loss of these ice bodies from the GLIMS inventory as being associated with either less-than-favourable imaging conditions for the Landsat 7 scenes, or human error related to conflicting interpretations of glacier definition. To resolve these latter conflicts, it is recommended that future inventory creators refer to multi-year imagery to confirm the perennial status of small ice bodies, as was demonstrated for small ice bodies in generating the baseline inventory (Reference OmmanneyOmmanney, 1969).
Island-wide, the area coverage of glaciers derived from major ice caps in the year 2000 was found to be on the order of 90% of the 1959 extent, whereas independent ice masses (remnant glaciers, niche glaciers, cirque glaciers and ice aprons) maintained only ∼50–80% of their 1959 extent.
According to assessments made by Reference OmmanneyOmmanney (1969), >90% of glaciers showed either marked or slight retreat at the date to which his inventory refers. The remaining glaciers, which exhibited either marked advance or surge potential, were limited to regions dominated by the outlet glaciers of SIC and MIC. Our measurements of glacier growth or minimal shrinkage within these two regions, and more prevalent shrinkage elsewhere, indicate that Reference OmmanneyOmmanney’s (1969) assessments were both perceptive and correct.
Similar to trends observed throughout polar and mountainous regions, we observed the greatest ice loss in regions dominated by small, remnant glaciers. These findings have been attributed to the greater sensitivity of small glaciers to climate forcing (Reference Braun, Hardy and BradleyBraun and others, 2004; Reference Dyurgerov, Meier, Bamber and PayneDyurgerov and Meier, 2004; Reference Paul, Kääb and HaeberliPaul and others, 2007; Reference Andreassen, Paul, Kääb and HausbergAndreassen and others, 2008; Reference Paul and AndreassenPaul and Andreassen, 2009; Reference Paul and SvobodaPaul and Svoboda, 2009; Reference Bolch, Menounos and WheateBolch and others, 2010). Most surprising was that 294 small glaciers, over one-quarter of all glaciers on the island (according to 1959 definitions), were unlisted in the 2000 GLIMS inventory. Field reconnaissance of ‘missing glacier’ locations suggests that, if our field observations are scaled up, ∼165 small glaciers and perennial ice patches have disappeared from the island since 1959, and that the remaining ‘missing glaciers’ are artefacts associated with the use of satellite imagery, which has a comparatively coarser resolution than the photography collected in 1959. As Eureka, to the east of AHI, has experienced a 3.2°C increase in annual average surface temperature since 1972 (G. Lesins and others, unpublished information), we believe that the glacier shrinkage reported here has been in response to that warming, similar to glacier responses to climate warming reported elsewhere in the circumpolar regions (Reference DowdeswellDowdeswell and others, 1997; Reference Sharp, Copland, Filbert, Burgess and WilliamsonSharp and others, 2003; Reference Arendt, Walsh and HarrisonArendt and others, 2009).
The increase in ice area around MIC is thought to be due both to the surges of Iceberg Glacier and ‘Airdrop Glacier’ and changes in ice velocity, which are more pronounced along the steeper western margin of the ice cap than in the glaciers along the eastern margin which terminate on a broad and shallow sloping plateau.
The potential exists to extend the temporal coverage by incorporating: extents from the Little Ice Age generated by Reference Wolken, England and DykeWolken and others (2008), as was done for the Glacier National Park area (Reference Champoux and OmmanneyChampoux and Ommanney, 1986); previous limits identifiable from photography in the 1940s and 1950s; and glacier extents from past and future satellite imagery. While beyond the scope of this study, changes in ice volume should be investigated to determine whether there has been a more substantial overall loss of mass from the island. Fortunately, annual mass balances have been measured in the Expedition Fiord area (Reference Adams, Cogley, Ecclestone and DemuthAdams and others, 1998; Reference Cogley and AdamsCogley and Adams, 2000; Reference Cogley, Adams and EcclestoneCogley and others, 2011) for the last 50 years, so critical field data to complement the broader regional studies continue to accumulate. As the small ice masses have proven to be particularly responsive to climate forcing, it is important that measurements continue on Baby Glacier (∼0.6 km2) (Reference Adams, Cogley, Ecclestone and DemuthAdams and others, 1998). The mass-balance measurements summarized by Reference Cogley, Adams and EcclestoneCogley and others (2011) are temporally complementary to the baseline inventory as they provide a nearly continuous series of measurements since 1959 for White and Baby Glaciers, with respective mass balances of −175 and −150 mm w.e. a−1.
Reference Evans and CoxEvans and Cox (2010), in their study of Spitsbergen glaciers, commented on the value of inventories for recovering climate information, while expressing concern about the omission of smaller glaciers from many inventories. The value of including such glaciers has been demonstrated in this study, as has the value of the original classification table that allowed us to differentiate components of an inhomogeneous population that are subject to different lags and forcings. A simple comparison of differences in area is not enough to assess a regional glacier response to climate change.

Using a variety of optical satellite scenes, this study quantifies the change in the areal extent of 1773 glaciers across Northern Ellesmere Island between ~1999 and ~2015. Our results show that the regional ice coverage decreased by 1705.3 km2 over the ~16-year period, a loss of ~5.9%. Ice shelves had the greatest losses relative to their size, of ~42.4%. Glaciers feeding into ice shelves reduced in area by 4.7%, while tidewater glaciers reduced in area by 3.3%. Marine-terminating glaciers with floating ice tongues reduced in area by 4.9%, and 19 of these 27 ice tongues disintegrated, causing these glaciers to retreat to their grounding lines. Land-terminating glaciers lost 4.9% of their 1999 area, including the complete loss of three small ice caps (<1.5 km2). Our study highlights the high sensitivity of the ice cover of Northern Ellesmere Island to recent climate warming and the continued losses that are likely to occur in the future. In particular, the ice masses most susceptible to further losses are marine-terminating glaciers with floating termini and small land-terminating ice caps at low elevations.
The Canadian Arctic Archipelago (CAA) contains ~150 000 km2 of glacier ice, making this region the most glaciated in the world outside of Greenland and Antarctica (Pfeffer and others, Reference Pfeffer2014). Based on satellite gravimetry measurements, this region has become the single largest contributor to eustatic sea-level rise outside of the major ice sheets since 2003 (Harig and Simons, Reference Harig and Simons2016), during a period of rapid warming of glacier surface temperatures (Mortimer and others, Reference Mortimer, Sharp and Wouters2016). The ice in this area can be separated into two groups, the southern area that spans Baffin (~36 839 km2) and Bylot (~4859 km2) islands, and the northern area (107 488 km2) that spans the Queen Elizabeth Islands, of which 27 556 km2 (all ~1960 areas) is located on Northern Ellesmere Island (Fig. 1; Andrews, Reference Andrews, Williams and Ferrigno2002; Sharp and others, Reference Sharp, Kargel, Bishop, Kaab, Raup and Leonard2014).
The first detailed measurements of glacier thickness and volume change across Northern Ellesmere Island were conducted by Abdalati and others (Reference Abdalati2004), who used repeat airborne altimetry measurements over the period 1995–2000 to calculate changes of −3.52 km3 a−1 (the highest rate of ice volume loss compared with all other ice caps in the CAA). Sharp and others (Reference Sharp, Kargel, Bishop, Kaab, Raup and Leonard2014) performed measurements of the area change of glaciers (excluding ice shelves) on Northern Ellesmere Island up to the year 2000, by using ice extents from 1956 to 1961 derived from aerial photography and 2000 extents delineated using an unsupervised classification of Landsat 7 ETM+ and ASTER imagery. Their study revealed that Northern Ellesmere experienced a reduction in glaciated area of 927 km2 (3.4% of initial area) over this period, the greatest area loss of all regions measured across the CAA. The largest mean percentage area changes for Northern Ellesmere occurred from glaciers <1 km2 in area, which lost an average of 29.2% of their initial ice area. Since 2000, a few studies have been conducted on Northern Ellesmere Island to assess changes in ice shelf area (e.g., Copland and others, Reference Copland, Mueller and Weir2007; Mueller and others, Reference Mueller, Copland and Jeffries2017a, Reference Mueller, Copland, Jeffries, Copland and Muellerb) and the changes of individual ice caps (Braun and others, Reference Braun, Hardy and Bradley2004; Serreze and others, Reference Serreze, Raup, Braun, Hardy and Bradley2017), but no detailed regional assessment of glacier changes has been conducted.
Here we present a comprehensive inventory of the number and extent of all glaciers on Northern Ellesmere Island, using satellite data acquired between 1999 and 2016. This is the first study to present recent area change measurements for this region and to analyze the spatial variability in glacier change in relation to terrain controls. Our data will be made available in the Global Land Ice Measurements from Space (GLIMS) database (http://www.glims.org).
Ellesmere Island is the largest island in the Queen Elizabeth Islands, with an area of 196 236 km2 and a length of 830 km (Fig. 1). The island is the most mountainous in the CAA and can be separated into different ice regions from north to south that includes Northern Ellesmere Icefield, Agassiz Ice Cap, Prince of Wales Icefield, Manson Icefield and Sydkap Icefield (Fig. 1). The study area of Northern Ellesmere is separated from the rest of Ellesmere Island by the Hazen Plateau and Greely Fiord and has a maximum elevation of 2616 m at Barbeau Peak (Fig. 2). Lake Hazen is a large inland lake, with a surface area of 537.5 km2, which stretches in a southwest-northeast direction in the southeast part of Northern Ellesmere (Fig. 2). The Northern Ellesmere Icefield spans the majority of the island, while ice shelves and marine-terminating glaciers flow off the northern coastline. Smaller ice caps, such as Grant and Ad Astra, surround the main ice caps, but the majority are unnamed.
The climate regime of Northern Ellesmere varies between the coastal regions, interior lowlands and highlands. The coastal waters contain a mix of first- and multi-year ice. In summer, fall and early winter (during the sea-ice consolidation period), the varying coverage of sea ice and open water leads to high frequencies of fog and low cloud over the channels and along the coastlines (Maxwell, Reference Maxwell1981). The interior lowlands are surrounded by mountains which cause a rain shadow that results in low mean precipitation, while exposed slopes at higher elevations receive >200 mm of precipitation per year (Maxwell, Reference Maxwell1981). At Eureka weather station, ~100 km to the southwest of the Northern Ellesmere Icefield, mean monthly precipitable water ranged from 1.8 mm in late winter to 12 mm in July between 1961 and 2007, with a 10% increase in mean annual precipitable water over this period (Fig. 1; Lesins and others, Reference Lesins, Duck and Drummond2010). The increase in precipitable water has been dominated by increases during the spring, summer and fall, with the greatest increase occurring during summer at a rate of 0.3 mm decade−1 since 1961. Over the 54-year period, the station recorded a mean air temperature of −19.1°C.
Area changes for each glacier were determined from optical satellite imagery within the periods ~1999 (period 1) and ~2015 (period 2) (Table 1). These periods were selected to provide the broadest temporal range with the highest resolution imagery, primarily from Landsat 7 (ETM+) and Landsat 8 (OLI). The north coast of Ellesmere Island was beyond the orbit of Landsat 7 in 1999, so ASTER imagery from 2002 and 2003 was used instead, covering 5.2% of the total glaciated area. Glacier coverage for Ward Hunt Ice Shelf and for glaciers along the far north-east coast of Northern Ellesmere (comprising ~4.5% of the total glaciated area) was not available for 1999–2003, so Formosat-2 imagery from 2008 and ASTER imagery from 2009 was used in its place for period 1. Due to the lack of satellite coverage over the Markham Ice Shelf for period 1 (Fig. 2), the extent (from 2003) was obtained from Mueller and others (Reference Mueller, Copland and Jeffries2017a). In the second period, Landsat 8 imagery from 2015 and 2016 provided complete coverage of the study area.
The ice cover across Northern Ellesmere Island was divided into individual drainage basins using a combination of elevation data and optical satellite imagery. Basins were delineated using a pre-release version of the ArcticDEM, a DEM with 8 m resolution constructed by the Polar Geospatial Center (University of Minnesota) from in-track, high-resolution (~0.5 m) Digital Globe imagery from 2012–15. A polygon shapefile was delineated for each drainage basin by using the Basin tool in ESRI ArcGIS 10.3.1. To create the basins, sinks were filled and an eight-direction (D8) flow model was used, which determines the flow direction of each raster cell based on the steepest path of the eight surrounding cells (Jenson and Domingue, Reference Jenson and Domingue1988). The automated basin outlines were verified visually against the 2015/16 Landsat 8 mosaic using visible features such as flow lines, and adjusted as necessary.
An outline of the ice extent was delineated for each glacier and nunatak from orthorectified ASTER (15 m resolution) and Landsat imagery (30 m resolution enhanced with the 15 m panchromatic band) and georeferenced Formosat-2 imagery (8 m resolution) (Table 1). Images with little to no cloud cover acquired during late summer were preferentially selected due to their minimal snow cover. Pan-sharpened Landsat 8 images acquired in 2015/16 were mosaicked and used as the master image against which all other satellite images were aligned (Fig. 2; bolded scenes in Table 1). Eight ASTER images and one Formosat-2 image were georeferenced to the Landsat mosaic using 13–20 ground control points (GCPs), depending on the amount of flat and stable bedrock available in the scene. Georectification was completed using a zero-order polynomial shift in ESRI ArcGIS 10.3.1, which resulted in root mean square errors (RMSE) ranging from 15.02 to 21.80 m (Table 1). One Formosat-2 image was transformed using a first-order polynomial transformation and had an RMSE of 21.81 m. All other imagery was well-aligned and did not require modification.
During the digitization process, pan-sharpened Landsat scenes were displayed in both true colour and false colour; the false colour composites were represented with bands 4, 3 and 1 (for both Landsat 7 and Landsat 8) in the red, green and blue (RGB) channels, respectively. ASTER scenes were represented with bands 3, 2 and 1 in the RGB channels. To avoid misclassification, only glaciers >0.1 km2 in area (in 1999) were digitized in this study, although glaciers that shrank to areas <0.1 km2 during the second period of study were included for continuity of the dataset.
Once the ice extents and ice divides had been defined, nunataks were subtracted from these outlines so that each polygon represented only the area of ice and not internal rock. The image acquisition dates were used to convert measured area (in km2) of the two time periods into standardized rates of percentage change per decade. Each glacier was assigned a unique ID following the format outlined by GLIMS, which incorporates centroid coordinates of each glacier (Raup and Khalsa, Reference Raup and Khalsa2010). The official name was included for glaciers with a name assigned in the Canadian Geographical Names Data Base of Natural Resources Canada (http://www4.rncan.gc.ca/search-place-names/search).
In total, 11 terrain variables were derived for the glaciers (in ~2015) measured in this study to examine the influence of physiography on area losses. The coordinates of the centroid of each glacier were extracted. The minimum, maximum and mean elevation, mean slope, flow length and mean aspect for each glacier were extracted from the ArcticDEM using the Spatial Analyst extension in ArcGIS 10.3.1. The east-west and north-south scalar aspects were derived from the sine and cosine of the mean of these scalar aspects (Copland, Reference Copland, Lane, Richards and Chandler1998). The main terminus for each glacier was visually assessed and classified into one of five types:
(a) Land-terminating glaciers refers to all outlet glaciers and ice caps that terminate on land, and in this study includes glaciers with proglacial lakes or glaciers that calve into the proglacial lakes of neighbouring glaciers.
(b) Tidewater glaciers are marine-terminating ice masses that are grounded on the sea floor (Dowdeswell and Jeffries, Reference Dowdeswell, Jeffries, Copland and Mueller2017). These glaciers were distinguished by their lack of extension away from the coastline and lack of tidal cracks. This category also includes glaciers flowing into ice shelves but without visual evidence of becoming incorporated into the ice shelf. Also included are coastal ice caps that flow into the sea. Note that if any land is apparent between the terminus and the coastline, the glacier is classified as land-terminating.
(c) Ice tongues are the floating extensions of single valley glaciers over the ocean (Mueller and others, Reference Mueller, Copland and Jeffries2017a, Reference Mueller, Copland, Jeffries, Copland and Muellerb). In this study, ice tongues are classified as floating termini that extend into a bay or fiord and include ice fragments clustered together and frozen in place by sea ice around the terminus.
(d) Ice shelves comprise extensive, permanent floating landfast ice features that are >20 m thick (Dowdeswell and Jeffries, Reference Dowdeswell, Jeffries, Copland and Mueller2017). In this study, ice shelves were identifiable by their characteristic undulating surface topography and their infilling of bays and fiords along the northern coastline.
(e) Ice shelf-terminating refers to glaciers that flow into ice shelves. Although these glaciers contribute directly to the ice shelves, they are separated from the ice shelf as per the GLIMS procedure (Raup and Khalsa, Reference Raup and Khalsa2010).
To provide an estimate of the changes in AAR of the ice cover of Northern Ellesmere Island, the hypsometry of this region was compared with estimates of the changes in equilibrium line altitude (ELA) over the study period. The ELA across Northern Ellesmere Island at the start of period 1 was determined from digitizing the map of Wolken and others (Reference Wolken, England and Dyke2008), which in turn was recreated from Miller and others (Reference Miller, Bradley and Andrews1975). Wolken and others (Reference Wolken, England and Dyke2008) describe this map as representing the ELA in 1960, but we assume that this ELA is broadly representative of conditions at the start of period 1. This is based on mass-balance measurements on other Queen Elizabeth Islands ice caps which show generally weak trends over this period (Koerner, Reference Koerner2005; Thomson and others, Reference Thomson, Zemp, Copland, Cogley and Ecclestone2017), and the observation that average glacier mass balance was five times more negative between 2005 and 2009 than 1963–2004 (Sharp and others, Reference Sharp, Kargel, Bishop, Kaab, Raup and Leonard2014). Since 1999, we estimate that the ELA on Northern Ellesmere has risen by ~100–300 m, based on measurements at White Glacier (Fig. 1) (mean ELA 1960–1998 = 1022 m; mean ELA 1999–2014 = 1205 m; Thomson and others, Reference Thomson, Zemp, Copland, Cogley and Ecclestone2017) and measurements on northern Agassiz Ice Cap that indicate the 2014/15 ELA was 300 m above the 1977–2015 mean (Burgess, Reference Burgess2017).
To calculate error associated with the alignment and resolution of the satellite imagery, we used the method defined by Hall and others (Reference Hall, Baa, Schöner, Bindschadler and Chien2003). The uncertainty in the change of the ice extent in the linear dimension (d) between two satellite images was calculated from (after Williams and others, Reference Williams, Hall, Sigurđsson and Chien1997):
where r 1 is the cell size of the first image, r 2 is the cell size of the second image and RMSE is the error calculated during the georectification process (Table 1). The finest resolution (15 m) and the highest RMSE value (21.81 m) were used in this calculation. The linear uncertainty was converted to area uncertainty using (after Hall and others, Reference Hall, Baa, Schöner, Bindschadler and Chien2003):
where A = x 2 and x = linear side dimension (15 m). This calculation produced an error of ±0.0013 km2.
To calculate human error that may occur during the digitization process, the same operator digitized three different glaciers from the dataset for Northern Ellesmere, of differing sizes, environments, and locations, at a consistent scale of 1: 10 000. Each glacier was digitized five times for each time period using imagery from the study. G85164W81925N, G75159W81335N and G69499W82211N were selected based on their range in size, distribution and terminal environment: G85164W81925N (5.99 km2 in 1999) is a marine-terminating glacier in the northeast, G75159W81335N (1.00 km2 in 1999) is a small ice cap in the southern region, and G69499W82211N (254.52 km2 in 1999) is a large land-terminating glacier in the western region (Fig. 2). The mean error for both time periods varied between 0.004 km2 (0.07%) for G85164W81925N, 0.004 km2 (0.69%) for G75159W81335N and 0.136 km2 (0.05%) for G69499W82211N. The largest of these errors (0.14 km2) was summed with the satellite error (0.0013 km2) to provide a total error. Based on these error calculations, glacier area changes were considered significant if they were >0.14 km2.
To examine climate conditions since 1950, NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis monthly mean data was downloaded from the NOAA Earth System Research Laboratory website (http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/reanalysis/reanalysis.shtml). These data are drawn from an assimilated gridded (2.5° × 2.5° grid) dataset, based on observations from the land surface, ship, rawinsonde, piloted balloon, aircraft, satellite and other data (Kalnay and others, Reference Kalnay1996). It should be noted that NCEP/NCAR data prior to 1979 are of a lower quality to the lack of assimilation data, although this is considered to be of minor significance as this study is primarily concerned with changes in conditions since ~1999. For this study, mean monthly surface air temperatures from 1948 to 2016 were analyzed for grid cells centered on Northern Ellesmere Island from 80.587–83.190°N to 60.678–92.296°W. This climate dataset was verified by comparing observations collected by an automatic weather station in Purple Valley (Fig. 2) over the period 2008–16 to the NCEP/NCAR data gridcell centered on this region (82.500°N, −80.999°W). The close resemblance between these datasets (Fig. 3) suggests that the reanalysis data are suitable for assessing trends in air temperature across Northern Ellesmere.
For ~2015 a total of 1768 glaciers were identified, comprising 1702 land-terminating glaciers, 45 tidewater glaciers, eight marine-terminating glaciers with ice tongues, six ice shelf terminating glaciers and seven ice shelves or remnant ice shelves (Table 2; Fig. 2b and Fig. 4a). Land-terminating glaciers made up the highest proportion of the total ice area (63.4%), followed by tidewater glaciers (18.2%) (Table 2; Fig. 4a). Glaciers between 0.1 and 1 km2 in size made up 43.3% of the total number of glaciers, but only 1.2% of their total area (Fig. 4b). In contrast, the majority (40.8%) of glaciers were between 100 and 1000 km2 in size (Fig. 4b). The largest single ice mass is M'Clintock Glacier (G75759W82147N), a marine-terminating glacier with an ice tongue, measuring 1468.4 km2 in area and with a centreline flow length of ~44 km (Fig. 2). The majority of individual glaciers had a north-east facing aspect, while the majority of the total ice area had a north-facing aspect (Fig. 4c).
Mean glacier elevation ranged from 19 m a.s.l. (M'Clintock Ice Shelf; G77428W83023N) to 1519 m a.s.l. (G73513W81780N). Turnstone Glacier (G74388W81792N) had the highest maximum elevation (2603 m a.s.l.) as it flowed from Barbeau Peak. Overall, 54.1% of glaciers had a mean elevation between 500 and 1000 m a.s.l., with <1% having a mean elevation <100 m a.s.l. (Fig. 4d). There was a fairly strong relationship (r 2 = 0.253, P = 3.23 × 10−44) between maximum elevation and glacier area (Fig. 4e), with the highest elevations concentrated from east to west along the main spine of the icefields. Glaciers with ice tongues had the highest mean difference in the highest and lowest points of elevation: 1595.0 m, compared with ice shelves with the lowest mean relief of 33.4 m. Glacier slope varied inversely with glacier area (r 2 = 0.3055, P = 5.53 × 10−19), with smaller glaciers tending to be steeper (Fig. 4f). By glacier type, ice shelves tended to have the lowest gradient (mean slope of 2.0°) which is reflected in their large flat structure. The steepest glaciers, with a mean slope of >30°, were land-terminating with areas <1 km2.
The central part of the Northern Ellesmere Icefield comprises the largest contiguous ice mass in the study region, with an area of 19 445 km2 in 2015 (outlined in black on Fig. 2) and length of up to ~300 km and width of ~160 km, located between 81°N and 83°N. It had a mean elevation of 1203 m a.s.l. This icefield contained 360 glaciers in 2015, of which 344 were land-terminating, 12 were tidewater-terminating and four were marine-terminating with ice tongues. Land-terminating glaciers made up the majority of the icefield and had a total area of 11 294 km2. All of the marine-terminating glaciers drained along the northern coast, with the exception of one tidewater glacier (Otto Glacier/G82716W81419N) flowing off the west coast (Fig. 2).
Over the study period, changes in glacier area primarily occurred due to the calving of ice shelves and ice tongues, changes in the position of land-terminating glacier termini, narrowing of glacier trunks and tributary branches, and increases in the area of nunataks. In general, there was a widespread decrease in glacier area for almost all glaciers in the study area (Table 2; Fig. 5). Out of the 1773 glaciers present in the first period, 1353 (76.3%) of them lost >0.14 km2 (the limit of uncertainty) of their area. The remaining 420 glaciers all decreased in area, but not beyond the error limits of this study, and are therefore classified as stationary. No glaciers increased in area over the period ~1999–~2015.
A total of 1703 land-terminating glaciers were outlined across Northern Ellesmere Island for ~1999 (Table 2). Between ~1999 and ~2015, 416 were considered stationary and 1287 shrank beyond the limits of uncertainty. Of these 1287 glaciers, their total area loss was 844.7 km2 (4.8% of their initial area), but 150 glaciers (11.7%) lost >50% of their initial area. Separated by size class, the highest mean losses occurred from glaciers that measured <1 km2 in the first time period, at a mean rate of 30.4% decade−1 (Fig. 6). With each increase in size class, the mean rate of area loss decreased, with the lowest mean area losses (0.4% decade−1) belonging to glaciers >1000 km2. The greatest total area loss of 11.9 km2 (14.3%) occurred from G89730W81726N, a medium-sized (83 km2 in 1999) ice cap on the northwest coast of Northern Ellesmere Island (Fig. 2). Relative to initial area, the greatest losses came from G74438W81359N, G76500W81203N and G76132W82570N, that all disappeared (Fig. 7). These small glaciers were all <1.5 km2 in initial area and distributed north and south of the Northern Ellesmere Icefield (Fig. 2).
A total of 28 glaciers were classified as tidewater in ~1999, with a total area of 1894.8 km2 (Table 2). By ~2015, 24 tidewater glaciers had shrunk and lost a total area of 61.9 km2, 3.3% of the initial ice area, at a mean rate of 8.7% decade−1. Four glaciers did not lose area beyond the limit of uncertainty and were therefore classified as stationary. According to size class, the smallest tidewater glaciers (three glaciers measuring 1–5 km2) had the greatest mean loss of 22.9% decade−1 (Fig. 6). Similar to land-terminating glaciers, as the size class increased the mean rate of ice loss decreased with the exception of tidewater glaciers between 500 and 1000 km2 that had a higher mean loss (2.7% decade−1) than glaciers 100–500 km2 (1.8% decade−1). The greatest total area loss occurred from Otto Glacier (G82716W81419N), the largest tidewater glacier on Northern Ellesmere, which lost 19.5 km2, 1.6% of its initial ice area. However, this glacier is a known surge-type glacier (Hattersley-Smith, Reference Hattersley-Smith1969; Copland and others, Reference Copland, Sharp and Dowdeswell2003), which may explain some of these losses. The highest relative rate of area loss occurred from G74911W83042N and G91546W81713N which both lost ~27% decade−1. Two glaciers (Bent Glacier/G78692W81412N, and G85628W82087N) retreated to the point of becoming land-terminating.
In the first period, 27 marine-terminating glaciers with ice tongues were identified along the northern coast of Ellesmere Island, covering an area of 7843.7 km2 (Table 2). All 23 glaciers shrank by the year ~2015, with a total loss of 313.98 km2, or 3.6% of their initial area at a mean rate of 6.1% decade−1. Classed by size, glaciers with ice tongues between 1 and 5 km2 had the highest mean area loss of 11.4% decade−1 (Fig. 6). Of the 23 glaciers with ice tongues measured, only eight remained by the second period: G79570W82808N, Ayles (G80489W82741N), Serson (G84958W82170N), G79117W82870N, G80481W81907N, Disraeli (G72723W82423N), Milne (G78878W82327N) and M'Clintock (G75759W82147N) glaciers. The remaining 19 retreated toward their grounding lines, causing the glaciers to lose their ice tongues and become classified as tidewater glaciers instead (Fig. 8). The greatest total area loss occurred from Disraeli Glacier, with a loss of 35.6 km2, equivalent to 2.7% of its initial area. The greatest rate of area loss, relative to its area, occurred from G80169W82886N at 15.5% decade−1.
Between 1999 and 2009, nine ice shelves and/or ice shelf remnants were identified along the northern coastline of Northern Ellesmere Island with a total area of 1028.7 km2 (Table 2). From west to east, these comprise the Serson (G86130W82356N), Wooton (G84583W82434N), Petersen (G82050W82526N), Milne (G81511W82702N), Ayles (G80719W82854N), East Ayles (G79679W82827N), M'Clintock (G77428W83023N), Ward Hunt (G74723W83074N) and Markham (G71378W83067N) ice shelves. By ~2015, the ice shelves lost 436.1 km2 of ice area, 42.4% of their original area. The greatest total area loss occurred from the Serson Ice Shelf (G86130W82356N), which lost 137.58 km2, leaving behind a small ice shelf fragment on the northeast coast of Serson Bay. The Markham (G71378W83067N; 49.1 km2) and Ayles (G80719W82854N; 75.4 km2) ice shelves lost their entire area.
In ~1999, six glaciers terminating into ice shelves occurred along the northern coast of Ellesmere Island, contributing mass to the Petersen, Milne and East Ayles ice shelves. By ~2015, these glaciers continued to flow into these ice shelves, but had lost a total area of 10.3 km2, at a mean rate of 4.2% decade−1. The greatest total area loss of 3.5 km2 occurred from G81767W82616N, a glacier flowing into the south-west region of the Milne Ice Shelf (G81511W82702N). The greatest loss relative to initial size occurred to G81776W82542N, a glacier flowing into the north-east side of Petersen Ice Shelf, which lost 15.4% at a rate of 9% decade−1.
To better understand the potential relationships between area losses and physiography, 11 terrain variables (Section 2.3; Table 3) were acquired from the 1346 glaciers that underwent shrinkage between ~1999 and ~2015 and had coverage in the ArcticDEM. The terminus environment for each glacier was classified as 1 if it terminated off the coast and 0 if it terminated on land. Glaciers that underwent considerable change prior to the acquisition of the 2012–15 satellite imagery used to generate the ArcticDEM, such as Serson Ice Shelf, were excluded from the terrain analysis.
Once the terrain analysis had been completed, principal component analysis (PCA) was used to determine the relationship between terrain variables and remove collinearity between them. The PCA identified four significant components (eigenvalue >1) (Table 3). Component 1 is primarily an altitude factor that describes glaciers with high minimum, maximum and mean elevations, which tend to have steeper slopes and terminate on land. Component 2 is primarily a size factor that describes glaciers with longer flow lengths and larger areas, which also tend to reach to higher maximum and mean elevations. Component 3 is a location factor, dominated by glaciers that are located in areas that are further north and east than average. Component 4 is a north-facing aspect factor.
Over the period of study, components 2 and 3 were significantly (P < 0.0001) correlated with the % decade−1 area changes (Table 3). Component 2 was the most important factor (r = −0.461), which indicates that the biggest % decade−1 changes occurred on relatively short and small glaciers at lower elevations. Component 3 (r = 0.205) suggests that greater area losses occurred in the north-east. When the terrain factors for component 2 are plotted against area changes (Fig. 9), this reaffirms the fact that the terrain factors within component 2 are significantly correlated with area loss (P < 0.0001). The component 3 terrain factors, latitude and longitude, have a significant (P < 0.001) but the weak positive relationship with area changes; r 2 = 0.022 and r 2 = 0.007, respectively.
From these analyses, it is apparent that glacier size, elevation and flow length have been the dominant topographic controls on glacier shrinkage over the period ~1999–2015. In this case, the highest shrinkage rates occurred on small, short, low elevation glaciers. This is consistent with our results that show higher area changes from the small isolated remnant ice caps that surround the main icefields (Figs 6, 7). For example, ice masses that lost >50% decade−1 (with the exception of ice shelves) had initial areas <5.4 km2, maximum elevations <1676 m and flow lengths <4745 m.
In order to examine the past and future susceptibility of the glacier cover across Northern Ellesmere to melt, the ELA at the start of the study period (Fig. 10a) was used to calculate the regional size of the ablation zone, and from that the regional AAR. In 1999, 35.2% of the ice area was in the ablation zone (AAR = 0.648) (Fig. 10b, c). If this ELA rose by a conservative 100 m, the ablation zone would comprise 47.1% of the total glacier cover (AAR = 0.529). If it rose by 200 or 300 m, as seems plausible based on measurements on nearby ice caps (Burgess, Reference Burgess2017; Thomson and others, Reference Thomson, Zemp, Copland, Cogley and Ecclestone2017), the ablation zone area would then comprise 60.2% (AAR = 0.398) or 72.3% (AAR = 0.277) of the overall glacier cover, respectively.
Mean annual surface air temperatures across Northern Ellesmere Island increased by 3.6°C (0.5°C decade−1) between 1948 and 2016 (r 2 = 0.59, P = 9.01 × 10−15; Fig. 11a). A shift seems to have occurred in the mid-1990s when temperature increases accelerated from 0.12°C decade−1 from 1948 to 1994 to 0.78°C decade−1 from 1995 to 2016. Since 1948, fall (September, October, November) has shown the greatest overall increase in mean monthly surface temperature by 0.74°C decade−1 (P = 1.45 × 10−13), followed by winter (December, January, February) at 0.65°C decade−1 (P = 7.75 × 10−10) and spring (March, April, May) at 0.46°C decade−1 (Fig. 11). Summer (June, July, August) had the weakest rate of warming at 0.24°C decade−1 (P = 3.86 × 10−05), although there has been a regime shift from mean negative to mean positive summer surface air temperatures since the year 2000. Of the 20 warmest mean annual surface air temperatures since 1946, 16 have occurred since 2000. Every summer since 2000 has exceeded the climatological summer mean temperature (−0.7°C) by 0.6–2.7°C. Compared with the climatological mean from 1981 to 2010, mean monthly temperature anomalies have been consistently above the 30-year average since 2000.
From the above results, it is clear that the ice cover of Northern Ellesmere Island has been undergoing widespread loss since 1999, with two trends standing out among the observations: (1) The dominance of the shrinkage of relatively small, low elevation glaciers in terms of relative area loss; (2) The substantial loss of floating ice from ice shelves and ice tongues along the northern coast. In the following analysis, we begin by comparing our inventory with others of the study region. We then examine the relationships between large area changes and small land-terminating glaciers, together with changes in the ELA and AAR. To gain a better understanding the rapid loss of floating ice termini, we then examine the influence of oceanographic factors.
One previous complete glacier inventory for Northern Ellesmere Island includes the outlines in the GLIMS database. These outlines were provided to GLIMS by the Randolph Glacier Inventory (RGI 6.0), a global inventory of glacier outlines (https://www.glims.org/RGI/). According to the inventory metadata these outlines provide coverage for 1999 and were completed by several analysts using a semi-automated glacier classification. Our 1999 inventory differs from the GLIMS inventory in several ways, including total area values and basin delineations. According to the GLIMS database, Northern Ellesmere had an area of 27 377 km2, some 1569 km2 less than the area calculated in our study. The main reason for this difference is because the GLIMS dataset does not include all the floating termini extending from the northern coastline: ice shelves and ice tongues. For example, the area covered by ice shelves in our inventory amounts to >1050 km2. In addition, our inventory incorporates several more small ice caps (along the northern coastline) and better outlines nunataks across the region. Our basin delineations also differ from those of the GLIMS database, because our delineations were generated with the recently released, high-resolution ArcticDEM and verified manually.
A comprehensive inventory (from 1959 to 2015) of the floating portion of ice shelves and ice tongues along the northern coast of Ellesmere Island was produced by Mueller and others (Reference Mueller, Copland and Jeffries2017a, Reference Mueller, Copland, Jeffries, Copland and Muellerb). These outlines were digitized manually using anecdotal/survey data (1906), aerial photographs/maps (1959), optical satellite imagery (1963–1992) and SAR satellite imagery (2003–2015). The outlines include only floating ice that ends at the grounding line (i.e., excluding any land ice). In contrast, our ice tongue measurements include the entire drainage basin for each glacier, making a direct comparison with our dataset difficult. However, both datasets for the ice shelves are comparable because they both only include floating ice. For 2015, the ice shelf inventory by Mueller and others (Reference Mueller, Copland and Jeffries2017a, Reference Mueller, Copland, Jeffries, Copland and Muellerb) calculated a total area of 532.2 km2, whereas our inventory calculated a total area of 592.6 km2. The greatest difference between the two datasets is in the outlines of Ward Hunt Ice Shelf, where the discrepancy between the two datasets was 53.4 km2. Unlike the inventory by Mueller and others (Reference Mueller, Copland and Jeffries2017a, Reference Mueller, Copland, Jeffries, Copland and Muellerb), our outlines of Ward Hunt do not exclude any of the small ice rises on the eastern half of the ice shelf. In comparing the remaining ice shelf extents, the difference in area measurements does not exceed 4.3 km2.
An inventory describing the distribution of surge-type glaciers across the Canadian High Arctic was generated by Copland and others (Reference Copland, Sharp and Dowdeswell2003), and included Northern Ellesmere. Copland and others (Reference Copland, Sharp and Dowdeswell2003) used 1959/60 aerial photographs and 1999–2000 Landsat 7 imagery to visually identify potential surging glaciers based on the presence of surface features (e.g. looped medial moraines, intense folding, heavy crevassing and rapid advance) consistent with surge activity. The findings identified eight possible surge-type glaciers across Northern Ellesmere, four likely surge-type glaciers and one observed surge. The observed surge was from Otto Glacier (G82716W81419N), a glacier that was reported to have surged between 1950 and 1959 (by Hattersley-Smith, Reference Hattersley-Smith1969) and continued to surge or surge again by 1999 (Copland and others, Reference Copland, Sharp and Dowdeswell2003). An active surge was also reported for the Milne Glacier from 1966 to 1983, when the glacier advanced by 4.25 km at a rate of 250 m a−1 (Jeffries, Reference Jeffries1984). Based on the recent surge activity of the Otto and Milne Glaciers, it is possible that the losses reported in our study (22.54 and 19.48 km2, respectively) may be linked to the quiescent phase of their surge cycles. If all 13 of the glaciers identified by Copland and others (Reference Copland, Sharp and Dowdeswell2003) as being surge-type retreated solely as a result of surge behaviour, then this would account for 10.9% of the area changes determined across Northern Ellesmere in our study. However, the actual area changes attributable to surging are likely much less than this as only Otto and Chapman glaciers are known to have surged during the period 1999–2015 (Van Wychen and others, Reference Van Wychen2016).
Based on the terrain analysis presented in Section 3.3, the largest area changes occurred from small, low elevation glaciers. Separated by size class, the largest area changes occurred from land-terminating glaciers that were <1 km2, with a mean loss of 30.4% decade−1 (Fig. 6). Based on the results from Sharp and others (Reference Sharp, Kargel, Bishop, Kaab, Raup and Leonard2014), this trend was also apparent on Northern Ellesmere between ~1960 and ~2000, when 218 glaciers <1 km2 and 1–5 km2 in size had the highest mean losses of 29.2% (0.73% decade−1) and 25.6% (0.64% decade−1), respectively. For the other size classes described by Sharp and others (Reference Sharp, Kargel, Bishop, Kaab, Raup and Leonard2014), losses ranged from 22.2% for glaciers 5–10 km2 in area, decreasing to 2% for glaciers >10 000 km2. Sharp and others (Reference Sharp, Kargel, Bishop, Kaab, Raup and Leonard2014) also noted this trend on Agassiz Ice Cap, Prince of Wales Icefield, South Ellesmere Island, Axel Heiberg Island and Devon Island. Similarly, Thomson and others (Reference Thomson, Osinski and Ommanney2011) described a trend of significant retreat of small independent ice masses on Axel Heiberg Island, which included ice caps <25 km2, along with the complete disappearance of 90% of ice masses smaller than 0.2 km2 over the period 1958–2000.
Braun and others (Reference Braun, Hardy and Bradley2004) examined the mass balance and area fluctuations of four ice caps on the Hazen Plateau of Northern Ellesmere from 1959 to 2002, including the St. Patrick Bay (also in our study; Fig. 2), Murray and Simmons Ice Caps. In their study, the substantial loss observed from these small ice caps was attributed to low winter snow accumulation, the absence of ice flow and small vertical relief. Braun and others (Reference Braun, Hardy and Bradley2004) described these small ice masses as relicts of the Little Ice Age, no longer sustainable in the current climate as the ELA rises above their summits (>1103 m). Rising ELAs have also been observed in the mass-balance records of White Glacier, Axel Heiberg Island, the nearest long-term mass-balance monitoring site to Northern Ellesmere (Fig. 1). If the ELA at the start of our study period in ~1999 ascended as much as the ~200 m rise in ELA recorded at White Glacier since 1999 (Thomson and others, Reference Thomson, Zemp, Copland, Cogley and Ecclestone2017), then 60.2% of the regional glacier cover across Northern Ellesmere would be in the ablation zone (AAR = 0.398), and 589 (33.3%) glaciers would be completely below the ELA. According to Dyurgerov and others (Reference Dyurgerov, Meier and Bahr2009) most glaciers with balanced regimes will have an AAR of ~0.40 to 0.80, which would suggest that Northern Ellesmere is out of balance with the current climate. If the ELA were to rise 300 m, 940 (53.2%) glaciers would be completely below the ELA and the regional AAR would only be 0.277 (Fig. 10).
Serreze and others (Reference Serreze, Raup, Braun, Hardy and Bradley2017) described the continued loss of the Hazen Plateau ice caps up to 2016, and revealed that the St. Patrick Bay Ice Caps only had 5% of their 1959 area remaining (10.42 km2 in 1959 vs 0.50 km2 in 2016). The authors noted that the ice caps even shrank noticeably between 2014 and 2015, in direct response to the particularly warm summer of 2015. The rapid loss of these ice caps was also attributed to the more pronounced appearance of dirt layers on the ice surface, leading to a decrease in summer surface albedo. In 2016 the Murray and Simmons ice caps still had 39% and 25% of their 1959 ice areas remaining, respectively, which was linked to their higher mean elevations (up to ~290 m higher), thus providing relatively cooler summer conditions.
Between 1999 and 2015, there was a marked loss in floating glacier termini, including the loss of 18 ice tongues, the complete loss of the Ayles and Markham ice shelves, and substantial decreases in the Serson and Ward Hunt ice shelves. Unlike land-terminating glaciers that typically shrink gradually under atmospheric forcing, marine-terminating glaciers and ice shelves are subject to oceanographic forcing and can lose mass rapidly through calving.
Detailed studies have been conducted on several Arctic ice shelves, including the Petersen and Ayles, that document the events leading up to calving events (Copland and others, Reference Copland, Mortimer, White, Richer McCallum, Mueller, Copland and Mueller2017). In the study by White and others (Reference White, Copland, Mueller and Van Wychen2015), the Petersen Ice Shelf is shown to have undergone a series of calving events between 2005 and 2012, during record high summer temperatures, that resulted in a ~61% loss in ice area. The calving events were initiated by the loss of >50-year-old multi-year landfast sea ice (MLSI) that fringed the ice shelf front in 2005, and by open water events in 2008, 2011 and 2012. White and others (Reference White, Copland, Mueller and Van Wychen2015) also reported that in situ thinning and pre-existing fractures in the ice shelf would have weakened it, thus allowing ice islands to separate from the ice shelf during open water events and drift away. Copland and others (Reference Copland, Mueller and Weir2007) described the conditions leading to the complete collapse of the Ayles Ice Shelf in August 2005 that resulted in it calving within the space of a few hours and producing an 87.1 km2 ice island. Similar to the Petersen, Copland and others (Reference Copland, Mueller and Weir2007, Reference Copland, Mortimer, White, Richer McCallum, Mueller, Copland and Mueller2017) reported that this collapse was initiated by record high summer temperatures in 2005, and by the loss of landfast sea ice that had previously fringed the ice shelf. Copland and others (Reference Copland, Mueller and Weir2007) also reported that high offshore winds occurred during the event.
For marine-terminating glaciers with floating termini, the presence of ice mélange and sea ice provides a seasonally dependent stabilizing mechanism that allows the termini to remain intact and possibly advance (Reeh and others, Reference Reeh, Thomsen, Higgins and Weidick2001; Pimentel and others, Reference Pimentel2017). This has been evident with ice tongues composed of agglomerated ice blocks such as at the front of Jakobshavn Isbrae, Greenland (Amundsen and others, Reference Amundsen2010). During winter, sea ice forms and binds the ice mélange and prevents glacier calving, while the retreat of sea ice in spring causes the mélange to weaken and calving to recommence. Todd and Christoffersen (Reference Todd and Christoffersen2014) examined the calving dynamics of Store Glacier in West Greenland and found that the presence of ice mélange was principally responsible for the observed seasonal advance of the terminus.
These factors may have also played an important role in the loss of the floating ice tongues observed in this study, particularly in Yelverton Inlet and Bay where several ice tongues disappeared over the study period. According to Pope and others (Reference Pope, Copland and Mueller2012), 932.6 km2 of MLSI occupied Yelverton Inlet and Bay, including Kulutingwak Fiord in 1959. By August 2005, ~330 km2 of MLSI broke away from Yelverton Bay and was soon followed by the fragmentation of 690 km2 of older MLSI from Yelverton Inlet. In summer 2008 fragments of MLSI in Yelverton Bay and Kulutingwak Fiord broke apart and drifted away. In summer 2010 the last remaining plug of MLSI in Yelverton Inlet broke away, along with sections of MLSI from Kulutingwak Fiord. The loss of MLSI from this region means that the glaciers flowing into this system would then be exposed to an entirely new environment consisting of open water and young, thinner sea ice. It is likely that the loss of the floating ice tongues was a direct response to the loss of the back pressure previously provided by the thick and semi-permanent MLSI cover.
According to our observations between ~1999 and ~2015, regional ice coverage has decreased by 5.89% (3.68% decade−1) over the 16-year study period. This equates to an area loss of 822 km2 decade−1. From 1948–2016, the highest rate of warming occurred during fall and winter at 0.74 and 0.65°C decade−1, respectively. Although summer showed the lowest rate of temperature increase (0.24°C decade−1), the change in the mean summer temperature over time has resulted in a change from mean negative temperatures to mean positive temperatures since 2007 (with the exception of 2014). There is evidence for a small increase in precipitation over time on Ellesmere Island at Eureka (~10% between 1961 and 2007; Lesins and others, Reference Lesins, Duck and Drummond2010), but this is insufficient to compensate for the rapid recent increase in air temperatures.
Recent area losses from some glaciers, such as the Milne (G78878W82327N) and Otto (G82716W81419N), could be explained by retreat during quiescent periods after potential surge-type behaviour observed over past decades (Hattersley-Smith, Reference Hattersley-Smith1969; Jeffries, Reference Jeffries1984; Copland and others, Reference Copland, Sharp and Dowdeswell2003), but this is likely much <10% of the regional total. Two main trends for the remaining glaciers include the rapid loss of small, low elevation land-terminating glaciers and the loss of floating glacier termini in the form of ice tongues and ice shelves. The loss of small glaciers is a trend that has continued since the 1950s, and has been observed in other regions across the CAA as well (Braun and others, Reference Braun, Hardy and Bradley2004; Thomson and others, Reference Thomson, Osinski and Ommanney2011; Sharp and others, Reference Sharp, Kargel, Bishop, Kaab, Raup and Leonard2014; Serreze and others, Reference Serreze, Raup, Braun, Hardy and Bradley2017). Our analysis also revealed the complete loss of three small ice caps. The increased loss of small ice caps on Northern Ellesmere can be attributed to their increased sensitivity to the accelerated warming in the region, and the decrease in their surface albedo due to the accumulation of surface debris (Serreze and others, Reference Serreze, Raup, Braun, Hardy and Bradley2017). Small glaciers with relatively higher mean elevation are slightly less sensitive due to their cooler summer temperatures at high altitudes (Serreze and others, Reference Serreze, Raup, Braun, Hardy and Bradley2017). This is apparent in our study, where for land-terminating glaciers <10 km2, glaciers with mean elevations <700 m had a mean loss of 25.7% decade−1 whereas glaciers with mean elevations >700 m had a mean loss of 16.0% decade−1.
Over our 16-year study period, there was a substantial change in the amount of floating ice. Ice shelves lost ~42.4% of their initial ice area, including the complete loss of the Ayles Ice Shelf (−83.5 km2) and nearly the complete loss of the Serson Ice Shelf (−184.0 km2). Our inventory also identified the loss of 18 floating ice tongues, causing these marine-terminating glaciers to retreat to their grounding lines. Past studies have linked the loss of ice shelves to warmer summer temperatures, offshore winds and the loss of the protective barrier created by MLSI (Copland and others, Reference Copland, Mueller and Weir2007, Reference Copland, Mortimer, White, Richer McCallum, Mueller, Copland and Mueller2017; White and others, Reference White, Copland, Mueller and Van Wychen2015). These factors may have also played an important role in the loss of floating ice tongues observed in this study, particularly in Yelverton Inlet and Bay where several ice tongues have disappeared since the loss of MLSI in this region in summers 2008 and 2009 (Pope and others, Reference Pope, Copland and Mueller2012).
This study demonstrates that the icescape of Northern Ellesmere is changing and, if current temperatures persist or continue to increase, small ice caps will be the first to vanish and coastal zones will become free of floating glacier termini and ice shelves. If the ELA has risen by 300 m since 1960 levels, which seems possible given the rapid recent changes recorded by mass-balance programs on other nearby ice caps, then >50% of glaciers are currently completely in the ablation zone. It is important that regional inventories such as this one continue to be created and updated to monitor changing glacial landscapes in a warming climate.

February 24, 2010, was a big day for Agnico Eagle Mines Limited’s Meadowbank project, as Board chairman Jim Nasso, flanked by Inuit business and community leaders, watched the first pour of molten gold and silver doré from the roaring refractory furnace at the $700 million project.
Nasso passed that still-warm ingot among his guests, and later among the hundreds of excited workers who posed to have a photo with it. President and CEO Sean Boyd toasted their work at a gala mine site dinner with glasses of gold-flecked champagne and news that gold bullion that very day had touched a new record of $1,260 an ounce on world markets.
Before the Meadowbank mine was launched in 2010, the vast Kivalliq region of Nunavut hadn’t seen an operating mine for 25 years. But it has been the engine of a new economy, creating hundreds of jobs and fostered millions of dollars in business ventures for a cluster of small Inuit communities with very few other career opportunities.
For its veteran parent company, the mine’s $1 million-a-day output is the biggest in its portfolio of five mines in Canada, Mexico and Finland, making Agnico Eagle Canada’s fifth largest gold producer at $US1.8 billion in revenue last year.
Rewards come with Effort and Teamwork
The reward had not come without its measure of effort, investment and teamwork from both the company and its 790-strong workforce.
The Meadowbank project is geographically almost smack in the centre of Canada, yet is far from any existing infrastructure. Baker Lake, the nearest community, is about 110 kilometres south over an all-weather road scraped up from the tundra. It is the longest road in all of Nunavut.
Hauling in the construction, fuel and production materials is restricted to summer ocean freighters sailing into Hudson’s Bay, then by barge 320 kilometres inland to storage sites and tanks at Baker, and finally overland year-round via the road to the mine.
The 28 megawatt diesel plant that powers and heats the 11,000 tpd mill and 450 person camp has a voracious thirst. When the brutally cold winter of 2012-13 threatened fuel stocks, Meadowbank’s General Manager Dominique Girard took the critical problem to his team and worked out some solutions.
“We were looking at having to fly in fuel, and had to cut consumption. One option was to postpone projects, but also to stop idling all vehicles — when it’s warmer than -25C, equipment is stopped.”
“We achieved it, we did not have to fly in fuel… from 210,000 litres per day over January and February, we were down to 180,000 litres,” said Girard. “We saved around $400,000 in our first quarter over the year before… a major boost to the costs.”
The mine also started to burn its own waste engine oil, and is looking to source waste oil from community operations in Baker Lake. The landing strip at site was recently lengthened to accommodate Boeing 737 “combi” jets, an expense that’s easily compensated by greater efficiency of the bigger planes over small, prop-driven Convair aircraft.
“The real future (for really great efficiency) is not these individual steps,” says Girard. “We are working on the culture among all employees and contractors. If we have one thousand people working to reduce our costs, over the years, the savings will be huge.”
Growing that culture of teamwork crossed a major threshold early in the morning of March 10, 2011, when a disastrous fire wiped out the camp’s kitchen and office wing (see sidebar). Battling the cold and dark, the team stopped it before it could reach the accommodation block.
“A change started after the fire,” says Girard. “The fire created a sense of urgency, we mobilized the workforce to work together.” While it halted production, the full operation was restarted after only three weeks with temporary facilities and a vigorous new sense of what they can do by working together.
“It’s not magic. We use a systematic way to work. We do a risk assessment, we plan based on priorities while encouraging new ideas, we execute the mitigation plan and we celebrate our successes. ” says Girard. “We are minimizing risk and planning in advance how we could do better.”
A Clear Social Intent
Agnico Eagle has been earning kudos for investing in social responsibility, sustainability and corporate performance abroad and at home. An example of that social intent can be found at the Meadowbank mine.
It poured its first gold to great applause — and great expectation — that it would kick start the region’s remarkable mineral potential. Accepting the challenge of a chronically under-employed Inuit workforce with no mining experience, the company and the seven Kivalliq communities shared a vision: a stable sustainable mining economy and less dependence on flying in southern workers.
Meadowbank reckoned that on-the-job training, partnerships with a (short-lived) mine training alliance, and a steady pay cheque would be the key incentives for Inuit to stay on. Indeed, by 2011, Inuit workers were bringing $16 million home from their two-and-two week rotations.
But after two years, it wasn’t working out. A disappointingly high rate of no-shows was so bad it was hobbling production. The problem, said mine manager Girard, was the high cost of the additional workforce required to maintain a steady operation.
“In hind-sight, I would say maybe our expectations were a little high. Local employees were not ready to work in a mining environment, it was a culture shock,” he says, ” and changes were made over the last 24 months. We shifted to a one-on-one career path approach, including the southern hires, graphing an individual progression path showing timelines and milestones leading to promotions and higher wages.
“Today we are seeing perhaps fewer employees succeeding through the training program but the ones who pass are staying with us. We are doing a better assessment during the training, and we invest in work readiness up front to help them get used to being away from home, camp life, safety and personal finances.”
“They can see right at the beginning where they start, how long it takes, and what they need to do to grow into the job,” he said. They purchased a haul truck simulator and started an on-site 350-hour training program, and will be upgrading the reading and math skills,
It’s paying off, says Girard. Inuit turnover of 25 per cent in 2011 dropped to 16 per cent in 2012 and so far this year, a very impressive eight per cent. The program has even better results among non-Inuit: turnovers of 13 per cent in 2011 have almost disappeared, to two per cent this year. While the mine does not set aboriginal hiring targets, 246 Kivalliq Inuit were on the payroll in June of this year, just over a third of the total workforce of 786.
“In my mind, to stay over 30% is a very, very good achievement and we have many growing into more skilled positions thanks to the career path.”
Ambitious Growth, Disciplined Spending
The Kivalliq’s sparse mining history counts only two long-closed mines: North Rankin Nickel of the 1950s, and the Cullaton Lake-Shear Lake gold mine, west of Arviat, in the early 1980s. The Meadowbank deposit was found in 1987 and was acquired by Agnico Eagle in 2007 from Cumberland Resources. Development had alrea
dy started including negotiating impact benefit and partnership agreements with Inuit organizations.
The deposit, currently being mined from three pits all within seven kilometres of the mill complex, has 2.3 million ounces of gold in reserves and will yield 358,000 ounces annually through 2015. Exploration continues to define the resource, expected to operate until at least 2018. Eight to 10 doré bars a week are poured, running about 81 per cent gold and 19 per cent silver.
The parent company charts its roots back seven decades to 1953 when five marginal miners joined to form Cobalt Consolidated Mining. In 1957 they adopted the scientific symbols for their prime products — silver, nickel and cobalt — and became Agnico Mines. Led by Paul Penna, it merged with Eagle Mines Ltd, and in 1974 brought Eagle’s Joutel deposit into production.
It later acquired the Dumagami property from Noranda Mines, renamed it LaRonde, and from this foundation built a diverse portfolio of properties in Finland (Kittila), Mexico (La India, Pinos Altos) as well as in the prolific Abitibi gold fields of Quebec (LaRonde, Lapa, Goldex).
In 2012 it poured a record 1,043,811 ounces of gold and almost 4.7 million ounces of silver. Its gold reserves stand at 18.7 million ounces, plus approximately 96 million ounces of silver, 220,000 tonnes of zinc and 73,000 tonnes of copper.
And in an environment where metals have lost a lot of their shine, Agnico Eagle has an ambitious growth forecast of boosting gold output by 20 per cent — to 1.2 million ounces — by 2015.
In a July 2013 message to investors, CEO Boyd said the 200,000 new ounces will come from new properties and ramping up production at others. But during the current volatile market, he also announced it will be curbing exploration and capital spending by $US250 million over the same period.
“The low gold price has actually accelerated the industry from a high growth phase into a more moderate growth phase, focused on execution and delivery of plans,” said Boyd. “Agnico Eagle is no exception…. we’ve got the production growth, we’re able to pull back on some of that capital investment to improve flexibility and withstand the volatility.”
While the cuts are substantial, the company stills plans on ploughing some $US400 million into capital at existing mines and on exploration in Canada, Mexico, Finland, Alaska and Nevada.
Among the company’s advanced projects, another Arctic deposit stands out as its largest yet — the Meliadine find, 290 kilometres southeast of Meadowbank and just 25 kilometres north of the Kivalliq hub of Rankin Inlet.
Proven and probable reserves pegged at three million ounces have been found in seven deposits within a sprawling strike zone some 80 kilometres long. The company plans to invest approximately $125 million over the next two years on definition and grassroots drilling, ramp development, permitting and the completion this summer of a 24 kilometre all-season road to Rankin Inlet.
Further development will depend on the results of a technical report by mid-2014, market conditions and board approval. With a 60-year track record of performance, and 31 years of paying consecutive dividends, Meliadine may well be the next success story for both Agnico Eagle, its shareholders and Nunavut.
FIRE! at Meadowbank
The fire started small but grew steadily, spreading in the crawlspace under the kitchen and office wings and threatening the living quarters for some 400 workers at the Meadowbank gold mine near Baker Lake, Nunavut.
The danger was magnified by the weather. It was March 10, still dead-cold winter, and with the nearest help a two-hour drive from Baker Lake, the Meadowbank team was on its own. When the alarm was turned in at 4 A.M., workers were evacuated to the gymnasium and firefighters beat back the stubborn blaze with no injuries.
Production was not impaired, but the camp couldn’t feed the whole workforce. It sent about 300 workers home and kept a skeleton crew of 150 until a temporary kitchen was flown in. Meadowbank was back in full swing by April, suffering $18 million in direct costs and carving 50,000 ounces off its 360,000 ounce target for the year.
The cause may indirectly have been an opportunistic wolverine. An electrician had tried to repair the heat trace on a frozen pipe the day before, but the animal – regarded as one of the Arctic’s most ferocious critters – had claimed the cozy crawlspace as his. The worker wisely retreated but the fire started hours later, blamed on a short circuit. There is no word on the fate of the wolverine. .

The study, conducted by the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego, found shipping in Milne Inlet increased 583 per cent between 2015 and 2019. In 2015, there were 40 project-related transits in the region; four years later, there were 243.

“That increase is probably on par with some of the most rapid increases in commercial shipping on the planet,” Joshua Jones, the author of the study and an oceanographer at the institution, told The Narwhal. “The noise from ships can overlap with or make it more difficult to hear sounds that the animals themselves produce to communicate with each other or use to navigate within their environment.”
And there could be even more shipping traffic on the horizon.
Baffinland, which opened the Mary River Mine on Baffin Island in 2014, is now looking to double its capacity under a second phase of development, which is under review by the Nunavut Impact Review Board. Under Phase 2, Baffinland is proposing 176 voyages (or 352 project-related transits) for ore carriers between July and November each year.
Baffinland is currently permitted to ship six million tonnes of iron ore from its port on Milne Inlet, just west of the community of Pond Inlet, located on Eclipse Sound. The company wants to produce 12 million tonnes of iron ore per year and construct a 110-kilometre railway to move that ore from mine to port (it currently uses a tote road for that purpose).
The proposed increase in shipping in the area “raises alarms” because impacts on narwhal haven’t been studied enough, said Christopher Debicki, vice-president of policy development and counsel for Oceans North, a charity that helped fund the Scripps study.
“It’s grossly premature to come before an impact review board and propose to double or, as we suspect, triple shipping volumes out of this region,” he said.
Oceans North submitted the study to the review board on Jan. 18, ahead of public hearings into the expansion project.
Inuit hunters oppose plan, say narwhals are already suffering
Inuit hunters, who call themselves Nuluujaat Land Guardians, say Baffinland’s proposed expansion project will severely impact animals they rely on for subsistence, including narwhals, Clyde River Mayor Jerry Natanine told The Narwhal.
“Right now, we’re saying that the expansion project should not go ahead,” he said. “Considering the mine is already affecting the area too much, we have to figure out how to make sure there’s less effect, less noise in the area, so that the whales can come back and so that people can continue their traditional practices.”
On Feb. 4, two days before the public hearings adjourned until April, Inuit hunters blocked a tote road and airstrip at the mine, holding their ground for one week until a temporary injunction was issued. As reported by Nunatsiaq News, Baffinland estimated the blockade cost it $14 million.
Natanine said Inuit have been raising concerns about narwhals for years, adding the whales are increasingly exhibiting signs of ill health. He believes high volumes of shipping traffic are to blame.
“Hunters that caught some narwhals said they were so stressed that they hardly had any blubber on them,” he said. “They were very skinny. Not even edible.”
Amanda Hanson Main, technical adviser for the Mittimatalik Hunters and Trappers Organization, which is based in Pond Inlet, Nunavut, told The Narwhal hunters are seeing fewer calving and tusking events in Milne Inlet.
“They’re harder to hunt because they’re already stressed about the shipping,” she said.
A recent study, which is soon to be published in the journal Arctic Science, found that as shipping to and from the Mary River Mine increased, so too did the levels of cortisol in narwhal blubber. Between 2013 and 2019, when shipping significantly increased in the area, cortisol — a stress response hormone — more than doubled in narwhals compared to pre-mine years, according to the study.
However, the study found there are several factors at play.
“Increased vessel traffic, changing ice conditions, altered Arctic food webs, increased predation pressure from killer whales and cumulative impacts from these sources likely all contribute to increased stress levels for narwhals,” the authors conclude in the study, adding that there’s a need to continue monitoring the animals.
Some Inuit organizations aren’t completely opposed to the company’s expansion plan as many Inuit are employed by the mine.
The Qikiqtani Inuit Association — the landlord of the Qikiqtaaluk Region, which allows Baffinland to operate there through a commercial lease — signed an Inuit Certainty Agreement with the company on June 16. The agreement puts forward certain benefits such as Inuit employment and environmental monitoring efforts throughout the mine’s 21-year life.
Noise from ships may affect narwhal behaviour and communication: study
In 2016, as part of the Scripps study, Jones placed two underwater microphones in Eclipse Sound to determine how the soundscape changes when ships pass over it and how that may affect marine mammals, including narwhals and ringed seals, both of which are harvested by Inuit for subsistence.
To do that, he looked at the frequencies narwhals and ringed seals use for communication and compared them with noises emitted by ships.
The study found that vessel noise can affect both mammals depending on how close they are to the ships. As ships get close to narwhals, they emit noises at frequencies that start to interfere or “overlap” with the high-pitched noises narwhals use to communicate and navigate. “If they get close enough, they emit sounds that are loud enough that they could be causing behavioural disturbance in narwhals,” Jones said.
The farther away a ship is from an animal, the lower the pitch of sound it produces. When the noise reaches a lower decibel level, it can impede communication patterns of ringed seals, which make deep barks and grunts.
Ship noise can impact narwhals and ringed seals when vessels are within a few kilometres to more than 30 kilometres away, Jones said.
Jones found that some ships are noisier than others. The loudest sounds came from fuel and chemical tankers, along with an ice breaker the mine uses to chart a course through the sea ice as it begins to melt. (Shipping occurs between mid-July and late October, when there is the least ice present.)
Jones emphasized that the overlap of ship and marine mammal frequencies is predicated on a lot of guesswork and more research is needed to fully understand the extent of disturbances.
One of the key limitations, he said, is that they don’t have a measurement for narwhal hearing.
“There is no hearing test in the world for narwhal, so we’re stuck with some guesses.”
However, there’s no denying the sheer volume of ships in Eclipse Sound is “remarkable,” Jones said.
“It probably makes Eclipse Sound and Milne Inlet one of the most important areas in the world to try to understand the effects of changing shipping traffic on marine mammals because that change is happening so rapidly,” he said.
Heather Smiles, manager of stakeholder relations with Baffinland, told The Narwhal the company “has some of the most extensive and conservative mitigations for shipping in Canada, and certainty in the Arctic.”
According to a presentation Baffinland submitted to the public hearing, there’s no potential for temporary or permanent acoustic injury on marine mammals.
The report states “multiple lines of evidence indicate narwhals will be disturbed by vessel-based sound,” but those effects are “short term and localized.”
To mitigate possible disturbance, the company intends to implement speed restrictions and limit the number of transits in heavy ice, according to the document.

A proposed road connecting Yellowknife to the Arctic Coast — cutting deep into caribou calving grounds while crossing 640 kilometres of thawing permafrost — has leapt closer to reality, with $61.5 million in new funding pledged this week from the federal government and the government of the Northwest Territories.
The road, first proposed in 2012 by MMG Limited, a multinational mining corporation whose major shareholder is the Chinese government, aims to open up remote areas to mining that would otherwise be too expensive to reach. So far, only small pockets of land close to Yellowknife and existing highways have been economically available for most mining.
But biologists are worried about the impacts of the potential road and its associated development on the Arctic’s vulnerable land and marine ecosystems. The road could see nine new mines developed in the range of the Bathurst caribou herd, which is already in steep decline.
The project has a component on each side of the Nunavut/Northwest Territories border. In Nunavut, the $500 million “Grays Bay Road and Port Project” would be the first road connecting Nunavut to the rest of Canada. In the Northwest Territories, the “Slave Geological Province Corridor” is pegged at $1.1 billion.
On Tuesday the federal government pledged $21.5 million toward the first phase of development for the Grays Bay project through the National Trade Corridors Fund. The 230-kilometre road would connect a winter road servicing diamond mines in the Northwest Territories to a proposed deep-water port at Grays Bay on the Northwest Passage route.
On Wednesday, another $30 million in federal funding was announced for the Slave geological corridor, along with $10 million from the Northwest Territories government.
“Strategic investments in infrastructure — road, energy and communications — would lower the costs for exploration and development, and provide new opportunities for mines that have significant operational requirements for infrastructure,” a backgrounder released by the government of the Northwest Territories explained.
MMG Limited, which aims to develop the Izok and High Lake copper and zinc deposits in Nunavut, issued a press release on Wednesday calling the Grays Bay road and port project a “game changer” and thanking the federal government for funding to advance the project to “shovel-ready stage.”
“Road and port access is the key to unlocking the Izok Corridor, hosting some of the world’s most attractive undeveloped zinc and copper deposits,” MMG CEO Geoffrey Gao said in the release.
MMG had originally proposed that the federal government cover 75 per cent of the road costs and the Nunavut government pay the rest. MMG’s major shareholder is China Minmetals Corporation, one of China’s largest state-owned enterprises.
‘A basin-opening road’
There are no communities along the road’s proposed route and Northwest Territories MLA Kevin O’Reilly said the only purpose is “to facilitate mineral development.”
“There is always money for roads, but nothing for the caribou crisis,” O’Rielly told the Northwest Territories legislative assembly in March.
The proposed road would cut into the heart of the range of the Bathurst caribou herd, which extends straight north from the northern edge of Saskatchewan to the Arctic coast and eastward across the north side of Great Slave Lake. The vast majority of that area is either sparsely populated or uninhabited, but two decades of heavy mining exploration activity has been blamed in part for the herd’s precipitous decline.
From a population of nearly half a million in the mid 1980s, the Bathurst caribou plummeted to around 8,200 animals by 2018 — a decline of 98 per cent in a generation.
Only about 5.6 per cent of the herd’s total range has been disturbed, according to the Bathurst Caribou Range Plan Working Group. But a new road into the heart of the herd’s habitat and calving grounds could quickly change things, according to Brandon Laforest, Arctic species and ecosystems specialist for the World Wildlife Fund.
“You need to consider the cumulative impact of building what’s being self-proclaimed as a basin-opening road — in terms of the many offshoots that will happen, the many mines that will open up, the traffic being generated from those mines, including the traffic in the marine environment from ships,” Laforest said.
Brenda Parlee, University of Alberta associate professor of resource economics, said the Northwest Territories range plan for the Bathurst caribou — three years in the making with “essentially no budget” — is expected this summer.
Projections for nine more mines in caribou habitat
In developing its draft range plan the Northwest Territories government considered three possible development scenarios.
If the road corridor goes ahead, there would be 12 active mines in the Bathurst caribou range (up from three diamond mines already in operation). Aside from the mines themselves, the local roads and camps that connect them would hum with activity as supplies, ore and workers come and go. The full impacts of mine development on caribou — in terms of land and water disturbance, noise, dust and other kinds of habitat degradation — are still being studied.
“We keep looking at the minutiae for the amount of dust, or the amount of time the caribou spends running versus foraging, when the ecosystems are complicated,” Parlee said. “But if you step back from that kind of science, and you look at essentially what the elders have been saying for years, you can see how these decisions are ecologically impactful.”
The main road — let alone its spur roads, mines and port — would also have consequences for the herd.
“Any factors that impede recovery of the herd, even small-scale disturbances that reduce calf survival, can affect Inuit and other Aboriginal people’s ability to harvest this herd,” Lorraine Searle, director of securities and project assessment for the Northwest Territories’ lands department, wrote in a submission to the Nunavut Impact Review Board regarding the road.
That review was halted last summer to give the Kitikmeot Inuit Association, now the project proponent, a chance to work out its next steps after the Nunavut government initially withdrew financial support for the project when it appeared the federal government would not fund it.
The fragmentation of caribou habitat has long been established as a major cause for the decline of many herds across Canada.
“If we’re talking about a caribou herd that, population-wise, was a great deal healthier, the question of a road might be parenthetical to a discussion about development,” Parlee said.
“But given the fact that the Bathurst herd is essentially on the brink of something that no one wants to talk about, you’re adding yet another landscape level disturbance to a habitat that’s already compromised. It speaks for itself in terms of what’s important and what’s not important.”
‘We either have development or a healthy Bathurst herd’
The burden of dealing with crashing caribou populations across the Arctic has fallen almost exclusively on Indigenous hunters instead of on industry. The Northwest Territories government banned non-Indigenous hunters from harvesting Bathurst caribou, later expanding the ban to include Indigenous harvesting.
A study published in the journal Science Advances in 2018 condemned this approach, calling it “hypocrisy” to ban Indigenous hunting while approving large-scale projects that would further hurt caribou populations.
Parlee, one of the paper’s authors, said people in the northern communities — people she has been working with for more than 20 years — didn’t feel their voices were being heard by decision-makers in the north. Avoiding speaking on their behalf, Parlee said the data speaks for itself.
“It’s essentially a trade-off; we either have development or a healthy Bathurst herd in that area,” she said. “But I think it’s a fiction that we can have both.”
“Who bears the cost, and who benefits, is important,” Parlee said. “What kind of values are we protecting — and what kind of values are we disregarding?’
Arctic roads melting
Before this week’s funding announcement, the Grays Bay road and port project on the Nunavut side of the border was stalled following the rejection of a funding application to the federal government, which led to a postponement of the project’s environmental review. The Kitikmeot Inuit Association said Wednesday it intends to complete the assessment.
The port could help lower the costs of living for people in nearby communities like Cambridge Bay or Kugluktuk. Charlie Lyall, vice-president of Kitikmeot Inuit Association, told CBC the road would significantly lower the cost of living in the Kitikmeot as goods could be driven up through the Northwest Territories, put on ships at the Grays Bay port and distributed to communities.
It would also be the loading point for ships carrying ore from the new mines. Unlike diamonds or gold, which can be flown out, less valuable minerals need to be transported by ship or rail to be economically worthwhile.
“If you have a bulk mine that opens up, like an iron ore mine, that generates multiple transects daily,” Laforest said. The ships would need to travel east or west through the Northwest Passage — if west, breaking ice that the Dolphin and Union caribou herd depend on for crossing from Victoria Island to the mainland.
“Any icebreaking there would be disastrous for that herd,” Laforest said.
If the ships went east, they would likely travel through the newly established Tallurutiup Imanga National Marine Conservation Area, “a breathtaking Arctic landscape where narwhals live side by side with thousands of seabirds,” as described by Parks Canada.
In its submission to the Nunavut Impacts Review Board, the Kitikmeot Inuit Association said the icebreaking would not be done while the caribou are crossing.
Other roads built through the Arctic, such as the Dempster Highway or the Inuvik to Tuktoyaktuk Highway, have been dealing with growing maintenance costs as thawing permafrost heaves and slumps beneath them — and the highway itself can accelerate those impacts.
Louis Rifkind, mining analyst for the Yukon Conservation Society, said the road’s impacts on the landscape are likely to persist for a long time.
“Once the road goes in, it’s very rare for it to get torn out and remediated.”
Questionable local benefits
The justification for the investment by the government has remained the same: payback in the form of royalties, jobs and taxes. Mines in the North, however, have high proportions of southern workers flying in and out — not living in the communities.
In the Northwest Territories’ diamond mines, southerners made up more than half the workers the last time the government survey of mining employees was released in 2014. In Nunavut, the numbers are even higher: 60 to 70 per cent of the mining workforce is made up of fly-in/fly-out workers.
Social problems have quickly followed the development of northern mines. In the wake of the Meadowbank mine opening near Qamani’tuaq (Baker Lake), Nunavut, a 2016 UBC report found 71 per cent of women reported an increased use of alcohol in the community, while half experienced racism and sexual harassment at the mine itself.
“In the case of Qamani’tuaq and the Meadowbank mine, these opportunities are clearly a ‘mixed blessing,’” the authors wrote.
An early report on the Slave Geological Province proposal from the Conference Board of Canada found “the direct costs of the transportation infrastructure will be borne primarily by the public sector while the mine development costs will be borne primarily by the mine operators. Similarly, the quantified benefits will also accrue mostly to the mine operators.”
Put more simply, in the words of Rifkind: “The taxpayers are taking all the financial risk.”
Editor’s note: The Grays Bay road map was updated to correctly identify the range of the Bluenose-East caribou herd, which was previous mislabelled as the Dolphin and Union herd range.

The Qikiqtani Inuit Association should have addressed environmental concerns with a large mine expansion project on Baffin Island before it inked a benefits deal with the owner, according to a joint letter signed by mayors of five Inuit communities and chairs of local hunters and trappers organizations.
Baffinland Iron Mines wants to double iron ore production at its Mary River Mine on north Baffin Island under a second phase of development, which is being assessed by the Nunavut Impact Review Board. After months of delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the signing of the deal led the board to restart hearings. A pre-hearing conference wrapped up this week and the review board has yet to set a date for the final hearings.
The Qikiqtani Inuit Association, which is landlord of the Qikiqtaaluk Region and allows Baffinland to operate there through a commercial lease, signed the Inuit Certainty Agreement with the company on June 16. The agreement outlines benefits to the communities — such as Inuit employment and environmental monitoring efforts — throughout the mine’s life of about 21 years.

But leaders of hamlets and hunting organizations say the Qikiqtani Inuit Association, which represents 15,000 Inuit, signed the agreement prematurely and overlooked community concerns.
Louie Primo, senior administrative officer of Sanirajak (Hall Beach), told The Narwhal it doesn’t make sense to establish benefits with communities that remain concerned about environmental damage that could result from an expanded mine. “It doesn’t really resolve anything,” he said.
The joint letter, dated Aug. 29, was signed by representatives from Sanirajak, Pond Inlet, Igloolik, Arctic Bay and Clyde River.
The letter states that by inking the agreement, the association “has demonstrated a particular interest in the outcome of the hearing process and has a particular bias that must be balanced by a fair and complete consideration of all issues and concerns.”
The letter goes on to state that the agreement was put together “without meaningful input from our organizations” and the communities plan to adequately address possible impacts during the assessment process.
“We respectfully reserve the right to determine agreement with the project based on our own findings; separately and distinct from the ICA and the association’s determination.”
A spokesperson with the association declined to comment, stating that the organization is currently involved in meeting with affected communities.
Letter to Qikiqtani Inuit Association about Inuit Certainty Agreement with Baffinland by The Narwhal on Scribd
Minister of Northern Affairs urged review board to restart process
Technical meetings, community roundtables and hearings about the Mary River expansion project have been rocky, stopping and starting for almost a year. In March, hearings were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which limited both travel and public gatherings. They were rescheduled to be held virtually, but were cancelled due to concerns from intervenors that some people might not be able to participate in that format.
Almost one month after the certainty agreement was signed, Dan Vandal, minister of Northern Affairs, urged the review board to reboot the review process.
In a July 10 letter to the review board, he said “it is appropriate to recommence the formal reconsideration at this time” on the grounds that the Inuit Certainty Agreement was signed and both Baffinland and the Qikiqtani Inuit Association had requested it move ahead.
He further justified this recommendation by citing a section of the Nunavut Planning and Project Assessment Act, which states: “The responsible minister may indicate to the board that a review or a reconsideration of terms and conditions is a priority in relation to other reviews or reconsiderations and may propose a reasonable period within which it must be completed.”
The minister’s letter makes no mention of other projects over which to prioritize, and the hearing was not postponed due to any conflicting projects.
Mélanie Mellon, a spokesperson with Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs, said the Inuit Certainty Agreement “is a sign of progress, however decisions about the next steps in the Phase 2 reconsideration process are the board’s responsibility.”
With the easing of public health restrictions, the review board scheduled a blend of pre-hearing teleconferences, in-person meetings and video conferences between Aug. 31 and Oct. 1, according to a July 29 letter from Karen Costello, executive director of the review board to interested parties.
“The board has concluded that modifications and new approaches are necessary because an indefinite suspension of the board’s usual in-person proceedings to await a return to normal is unacceptable,” it says.
Once the hearing process is complete, the review board will issue a recommendation to the federal government on whether or not to allow the expansion project to go forward.
A spokesperson for Baffinland didn’t return a request for comment prior to publication.
Concerns around Baffinland’s expansion plans
Baffinland is permitted to ship six million tonnes of iron ore from its port on Milne Inlet, just west of the community of Pond Inlet, located on Eclipse Sound. The company wants to increase production up to 12 million tonnes of iron ore per year and construct a 110-kilometre railway to move that ore from mine to port (it currently uses a tote road).
If the expansion is approved, the number of annual voyages by ore carriers would more than double, from 81 in 2019 to 176.
Community representatives and environmental groups remain concerned about what increased ship traffic could do to sensitive habitats and the marine mammals that rely on them to survive. These concerns were also raised by the Government of Greenland. Earlier this year, the Government of Canada affirmed the Kingdom of Denmark’s right to be part of the expansion project’s assessment due to potential transboundary impacts.
“Overall, the transportation of the iron ore in the Mary River project must be considered one of the greatest threats to marine mammals in the Arctic,” Greenland’s Directorate for the Environment and Nature said in a memo included in a February letter from Denmark to the Canadian government, adding that there are risks of oil spills and collisions with whales.
Greenland’s memo also noted that ice breaking and ship traffic could affect the habitat of seals, walruses and whales, noting that bowhead whales are just returning to the area after virtually disappearing for 100 years.
The region is particularly important to narwhals, with Eclipse Sound, which Milne Inlet opens into, being home to 10 per cent of the world’s population of the species, the memo said.
If Baffinland’s proposed plan goes ahead, noise created by ships could permanently prevent narwhals from feeding in the area, it said.
Dollars and commitments outlined in Inuit Certainty Agreement
The Inuit Certainty Agreement includes environmental protection, employment and compensation for wildlife loss. Most benefits — such as a country food study and Inuit-led monitoring program — would be bankrolled by Baffinland, including $3 million for childcare infrastructure in the five affected communities and the extension of a program that offers $400,000 per year for fuel for Pond Inlet harvesters for the remainder of the mine’s life.
Neither Baffinland nor the Qikiqtani Inuit Association would provide The Narwhal with a total dollar figure for the agreement.
“As a transparent Inuit organization, QIA will release and discuss financial matters pertaining to the ICA with its board and impacted communities,” Sima Sahar Zerehi, a spokesperson for the association, wrote in an email to The Narwhal. “It is of utmost importance that this information is communicated and considered by those most impacted when considering whether or not to support the project proposal.”
According to the agreement summary document, the agreement “provides greater Inuit control and oversight, direct community benefits and new and expanded programs for Inuit in communities impacted by the Mary River project.”
The agreement also requires that Baffinland have enough financial security in place to “ensure that the entire Mary River project site will be cleaned up and restored when the project is completed.”
The Qikiqtani Inuit Association will hold money earmarked for reclamation, the document says, and, if there’s a dispute over the amount needed, Baffinland will provide the amount recommended by the association while the issue is settled.
Under the agreement, an adaptive management plan will be produced to monitor impacts from the project and prevent similar impacts in the future.
But Primo said an adaptive management plan may not be enough to address the intensity of the project.
“Let’s say that the activity becomes so great that the marine mammals just all leave and there’s nothing more there for the people to hunt,” he said. “I don’t know how you deal with that with an adaptive management process.”

If there’s scientific evidence backing up claims that barren-ground caribou won’t be impacted by a proposed mine expansion on Baffin Island, the mayor of Clyde River, Nunavut, has yet to see it.
Jerry Natanine told The Narwhal an absence of available data is stoking concern that increasing the size of one of the world’s northernmost mines could come at a serious cost to the environment and Inuit culture.
“We just want to hear what the scientists think and there’s been no one to answer,” he said.

Baffinland Iron Mines wants to double iron ore production at its Mary River Mine on north Baffin Island under a second phase of development, which is currently being assessed by the Nunavut Impact Review Board. Part of the expansion project involves building a railway to move that ore from mine to port, replacing a supply road.
The mine site is near traditional caribou hunting grounds that residents from Clyde River often use, Natanine said.
“We go caribou hunting there, and if they build that railroad, we’re thinking it’s gonna block migrations,” he said.
Natanine said that railway could affect the caribou’s migratory patterns and, as a result, subsistence harvesting. This is why having access to the science behind the project is so important, he added.
Yet, in an Oct. 29 letter to Premier Joe Savikataaq, Natanine states that the Government of Nunavut has “repeatedly refused” to provide information showing potential effects on caribou and whether government scientists agree with the mining company’s assertion that impacts will be “not significant.”
“This is unacceptable,” Natanine wrote in the letter. “For proper consultation and public engagement to occur, the government needs to make public all available information about potential effects on our environment and wildlife.”
“Apparently, the [government] has decided that the speculative benefits of the Mary River mine … somehow outweigh any possible negative effects on the ecology and hunting economy that already provide important economic and cultural benefits to our region.”
A spokesperson with the Government of Nunavut declined to comment in an email to The Narwhal, adding that “it wouldn’t be fair to provide a media statement before the courtesy of responding to Mr. Natanine directly.”
‘We want to protect our way of life, our hunting culture’
Baffinland is permitted to ship six million tonnes of iron ore from its port on Milne Inlet, just west of the community of Pond Inlet. The company wants to increase production by up to 12 million tonnes of iron ore per year. The company states that moving that amount of ore requires a 110-kilometre railway.
Natanine worries caribou could be scared off by the new railway or, worse, hit by locomotives. He said the new tracks could encroach on caribou habitat and be difficult for herds to cross.
“Caribou make trails and they always use the same trails over and over again every year,” Natanine said. “Traditionally, we’re not allowed to walk on that [trail] or do anything to it because the caribou are very sensitive to that.”
“What the mine is proposing to do is build a railway on these trails for caribou. We are questioning [the government] to see what their biologists … think about that.”
“The benefit of employment is something that we value, but, really, the bottom line is that we want to protect our way of life, our hunting culture.”
Baffin Island caribou were previously in decline
A survey conducted by the Government of Nunavut in 2014 estimated a population of 4,652 caribou on Baffin Island, which “confirmed a major decline of caribou” on the island compared to estimates taken in the 1990s.
The survey results, along with local observations, spurred an eight-month moratorium on harvesting. In 2015, a harvesting cap of 250 male caribou per year was implemented, which remains to this day.
Since then, caribou numbers on the island have improved, according to a 2019 government report. In 2019, 1,584 caribou were counted in southern Baffin Island compared to 346 caribou in 2014.
Natanine wants the caribou to remain in good shape. The expansion project could conflict with that, he added.
“We’re not really sure what’s gonna happen.”
With proper mitigation measures, caribou won’t be affected, company says
With mitigations in place such as adjusted speed limits, seasonal traffic limits on the railway and regular monitoring of caribou near the project, “caribou are not expected to be affected at the population level,” Megan Lord-Hoyle, vice-president of sustainable development for Baffinland, said in an email to The Narwhal.
During the review process, she said the company made additional commitments to protect caribou in response to concerns raised by Inuit, the Government of Nunavut and the Qikiqtani Inuit Association (the landlord of the Qikiqtaaluk Region, which allows Baffinland to operate there through a commercial lease).
These commitments include caribou research and data sharing between the company and the Government of Nunavut to “support regional caribou monitoring,” adjusting the railway design to make embankments gentler and working with Inuit and regulators, like the Nunavut Impact Review Board, to make it easier for caribou to cross the railway once built, Lord-Hoyle said.
The Inuit Certainty Agreement, a benefits-sharing and environmental assurance agreement co-signed by the Qikiqtani Inuit Association and Baffinland, is a means for Inuit to be more involved in adaptive management processes “by giving them direct approval authority over monitoring indicators, thresholds of acceptable change and predetermined responses,” she said.

Year after year, the ground across much of Canada’s Arctic is getting softer, turning to mud, falling into seas and rivers.
Permafrost, the glue that holds together so much of the north’s landscape – sometimes referred to by scientists as “nature’s freezer” – is warming up.
The changes come slowly, but the effects are dramatic – when we can see them.
In Nunavut, water and sewer pipes in the capital Iqaluit are cracking during the winter as the ground shifts – costing the city hundreds of thousands of dollars in repairs. In Nunavik, the northern third of Quebec, ponds and lakes are “browning” as thawing permafrost deposits organic matter into the water. In the west, cracks large enough to swallow a man have opened on the Alaska Highway in the Yukon. Great chunks of soil and ice are falling off coastline in the Northwest Territories and tumbling into the Beaufort Sea.
But permafrost thaw is just one symptom of a warming climate wreaking havoc in Canada’s Arctic. Thick, multi-year sea ice is disappearing, only to be replaced by thin seasonal ice; open, ice-free water is coming sooner and lasting longer; snow cover is increasing in some areas, decreasing in others; animal and plant species not seen by residents in the past are turning up, while others are disappearing.
Cumulatively, these changes are profoundly affecting the ways of life and traditions of Indigenous peoples of the north, who rely on the ice, land and sea.
“Indeed our identity is strongly linked to the ice, cold and snow,” said Siila Watt-Cloutier, an Inuit environmental, cultural and human rights advocate and author of the book The Right to be Cold. “Our right to hunt, our right to health, our right to educate our children, our right to safety and security … in fact, all of our human rights as Indigenous peoples would be minimized and destroyed by climate change.”
The Arctic has been described as Canada’s canary in a coal mine by Inuit residents and scientists alike when it comes to climate change.
Between 1948 and 2016, the annual mean temperature in Canada’s north increased by 2.3 degrees, about three times the global rate, federal scientists recently concluded. They also predict that even if global greenhouse gas emissions are reduced, average winter temperatures will rise by as much as 4 degrees in the Arctic by 2050. Under a scenario in which emissions continue to rise, average winter temperatures could rise by as much as 7 degrees.
Mean winter temperature increases across Canada between 1948 and 2016
Eventually, southern Canada will begin to experience similar temperature increases in winter between the years 2081 and 2100, according to the projections.
“What happens in the Arctic doesn’t stay in the Arctic,” said Watt-Cloutier.
“The people who are on the ground still sourcing their food from nature and who are connected to nature become not only the guardians, but we become the sentinels for the rest of the planet.”
About five years ago, Don Coughlin noticed that the rubber seals around the windows of his Iqaluit home were failing. The windows misted as moisture penetrated the spaces between the panes of his double- and triple-glazed windows.
The 67-year-old retiree then noticed that his back door wasn’t closing properly. He began to suspect thawing permafrost under his house.
“It’s the only thing that could do it,” said Coughlin, noting that in the 48 years since he moved to Nunavut, he has noticed warmer winter temperatures and earlier ice break-ups on Frobisher Bay. “Everything’s changing for sure.”
Like most homes in Iqaluit, Coughlin’s is built on piles – long steel pipes drilled deep into the permafrost (or bedrock if it can be reached).
Permafrost has what is known as the active layer, the top portion of soil that freezes during the winter and thaws in the summer. Ideally, piles go deeper than the active layer to fuse with the solid, permanently frozen permafrost below. Locked in, the piles keep structures level even as temperatures in the active layer change.
But warmer weather is increasing the depth of the active layer and warming the permafrost below.
This can cause piles to shift up and down, buckling floors, cracking walls and warping door and window frames of the buildings above.
In the crawlspace under his home, Coughlin found most of the piles holding up his house were uneven. Some had heaved up by more than two inches. He also found that a wood beam holding up his house was warped due to the pressure exerted by the moving piles.
“If we wanted to sell (the house), it would be harder and we’d get a much lower price because of it,” he said.
Coughlin estimates it could cost as much as $50,000 to re-level his home.
Piles holding up people’s homes aren’t the only crucial pieces of infrastructure being affected by thawing permafrost.
The City of Iqaluit has in recent years been burying its water and sewer pipes deeper and deeper in the hope of avoiding the movement caused by the freezing and thawing in the active layer.
Over the last 10 years, water pipes buried in the ground have begun to move and crack with increasing frequency as the active layer has grown, says Iqaluit mayor Madeleine Redfern. Since January, the city of 8,000 has seen four significant water line breaks.
“One of the pipes that broke was 17 feet below the surface, and it took over a week for the heavy machinery to even reach the pipe,” Redfern said. “Quite a number of our residents were without water not just for hours, but in some cases days.”
The city spent over $300,000 this past winter to tackle the problem. “That’s a lot on a municipal budget of just over $40 million,” she said.
Permafrost, defined as ground containing ice, soil, peat and rocks that stays frozen for a minimum of two years, underlies about 50 per cent of Canada.
Permafrost distribution in Canada
Between 2014 and 2017, the Iqaluit International Airport underwent $300 million worth of improvements, including a new terminal and lighting system. A significant portion of the funds was spent to repair runways and taxiways that had cracked and warped due to ice-rich permafrost thaw. One of the taxiways was so deformed, jets couldn’t use it.
Michel Allard, a permafrost expert and a professor in the geography department at Université Laval, created a permafrost and geology map of Iqaluit and discovered that the airport was built on top of a network of ice wedges – v-shaped bodies of ice that vertically taper downward into the permafrost.
In warmer weather, ice wedges thaw, causing the ground to sink.
Cracks in the runway and taxiways had to be excavated and filled with styrofoam insulation before the surface was repaved during the upgrades.
“The big issue is if climate warming continues, eventually the active layer will get deeper,” said Allard. “We can expect that the damage will start to occur again ... it is going to be sensitive to climate warming. There is no escape.”
Across town, local athletes were dealt a blow when city staff discovered in 2003 that a section of the two-year-old Arctic Winter Games Arena ice pad was sinking and shifting due to thawing permafrost. The rink was out of commission for seven years while the city tore up the concrete pad, installed a new foundation of piles drilled deep into the ground and built a steel grid floor at a cost of $2.2 million.
Since it’s reopening in 2010, there haven’t been any problems, but pavement in the parking lot is starting to sink.
Redfern says there is a mismatch between the criteria to access federal funds for climate change projects and what her community needs.
“The vast majority of climate change programs are focused on reducing greenhouse gas emissions,” she noted. “Not to say that those initiatives aren’t important, but the reality is that we’re dealing with climate change effects now.”
Redfern said a lack of precipitation last year led to the alarming possibility that the amount of water in Iqaluit’s reservoir, Lake Geraldine, would be insufficient to meet demand. The city spent millions of dollars pumping water from a nearby river to replenish the reservoir.
Redfern says that when the city tried to get funding to address the water shortage, “we were being told by different federal officials and bureaucrats, ‘No, no, no ... There’s more precipitation.’”
“Canada’s Arctic is four million square kilometres. It’s not uniform,” she said.
Last year, the Office of the Auditor General of Canada found that the territorial government had not fully assessed the risks of a changing climate by, for example, failing to identify communities at greatest risk and determine how climate change was affecting biodiversity.
“Climate change is such a large subject area and it has been hard to prioritize activities,” said Sara Holzman, acting climate change adaptation manager with the Nunavut government.
She said the territory is working with its federal counterparts “to help them develop programs that work for us in the North.”
Allen Gordon doesn’t dare cross the Koksoak River for the annual spring goose hunt anymore.
Not since that May evening in the mid-1990s when he and a friend crossed the river while returning from goose blinds about 10 kilometres from their homes in Kuujjuaq, a village of about 2,800 in Nunavik, the northernmost region of Quebec.
The pair were crossing the river near Old Fort Chimo, a trading post set up by the Hudson’s Bay Company in the 1830s. They noticed that the ice was cracked, thin and moving. The next day, the ice broke up, much earlier in the season than it had in the past.
“That scared us,” said Gordon, an Inuit guide and executive director of the Nunavik Tourism Association. “We used to have absolutely no worries going down that way … With the warming of the temperature, we didn’t realize, we were still thinking it was still safe like before.”
Gordon never went back. Since then, he says the river, which used to stay frozen until the second week of June, has been breaking up in May.
A 2011 study forecast that sea ice in Hudson Bay and surrounding water bodies will become about 50 per cent thinner on average in the Hudson Strait and Ungava Bay between 2041 and 2070 when compared to 1961-1990.
Farther north, the prognosis isn’t any better.
According to Canada’s Changing Climate Report, released this year by Environment and Climate Change Canada, continued reductions in sea ice area can be expected across the Canadian Arctic during summer and most Arctic marine regions will have no sea ice for part of the summer by 2050.
This is caused by a longer melt season thanks to warmer temperatures in the spring. The resulting dark, open water absorbs more radiation from the sun and becomes warmer. This in turn results in later fall freeze-ups.
This is not new. From 1968 to 2015, summer sea ice area decreased at a rate of between five and 20 per cent per decade, depending on region, across the Canadian Arctic, according to the report.
Gordon says declining sea ice on Ungava Bay is resulting in big changes.
Ringed seals, which Inuit rely on for meat and skins, need sea ice to create snow burrows where they give birth to their pups.
“But with no more sea ice being frozen thick enough, the seals have moved away,” he said.
Now, polar bears, which eat seals, are coming ashore to look for different food sources, Gordon said. “We’re actually seeing more than ever.”
Watt-Cloutier, who also lives in Kuujjuaq, says snow and ice are integral parts of Inuit identity.
“That allows us to go out and hunt in our organic supermarkets, which is out on the land and the ice to feed our families,” she said. “This is who we are. We are still hunters. We’re still fishers. We’re still gatherers. Even though we have modern work days, we are still a people very, very connected to our way of life.”
In 2005, as chair of the Inuit Circumpolar Conference, Watt-Cloutier launched a petition addressed to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, alleging that global warming due to greenhouse gas emissions from the United States violated Inuit human rights. Supported by testimony from more than five dozen Inuit hunters and elders from northern Canada and Alaska, the petition, which ultimately failed, described how global warming was destroying the environment and their hunting-based culture.
“Governments have all the right rhetoric when they’re campaigning, but they certainly aren’t doing the right thing in terms of protecting many of the lands of Indigenous people,” she said.
Some 2,000 kilometres northwest of Nunavik, where the M’Clure Strait opens into the vast expanse of the Beaufort Sea, lies the westernmost island of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, Banks Island.
Here on this cold, remote land mass in the Northwest Territories, virtually uninhabited by humans (the population hovers close to 100), scientists keep a close watch as the effects of climate change unfold.
In his 43 years of studying permafrost in the Arctic, Antoni Lewkowicz, a geography professor at the University of Ottawa and president of the Canadian Permafrost Association, has seen the impacts of climate change first-hand but not to the magnitude he and fellow researcher Robert Way discovered recently on Banks Island.
Using satellite images of the island taken over 31 years, the researchers discovered a 60-fold growth in the number of landslides caused by melting ground ice in permafrost. These landslides, known as “retrogressive thaw slumps,” or RTS, increased from 63 in 1984 to 3,942 in 2015, with a maximum of 4,077 observed in 2013.
They predict that after 2075, more than 10,000 new retrogressive thaw slumps will appear every decade on the island as the climate continues to warm.
“My emotion was mostly astonishment at the degree and importance of the change,” said Lewkowicz, noting that his findings linked the changes to warm summers.
Thaw slumps are being documented throughout northwestern Canada and Alaska.
In warm temperatures, the active layer thaws more rapidly and deeply into the frozen, ancient permafrost below.
Soil and mud in the active layer becomes dislodged and slides or oozes away, exposing the ice within the permafrost. Once the ice is exposed on these newly formed slopes, known as headwalls, it begins to melt.
Depending on the temperature, headwalls can retreat by as many as 10 to 15 metres per year, cratering the land. The displaced sediments can impact water quality in streams and lakes, contribute to coastal erosion, and disrupt traditional Indigenous travel routes.
“Climate warming means that what used to be extreme is becoming more common and what used to be impossible is now becoming possible,” Lewkowicz said.
A byproduct of thawing permafrost is the release of carbon from decaying organic materials that have accumulated in the frozen ground over thousands of years. Scientists estimate that almost 1.7 trillion tonnes of organic carbon is stored in northern permafrost – twice as much carbon as there is in the atmosphere.
When permafrost thaws, microbes break down this organic material, releasing both carbon dioxide and methane into the atmosphere. Together, these two greenhouse gases contribute to what Guelph University ecosystem ecologist Merritt Turetsky calls “Arctic amplification” of climate change.
“Permafrost thaw is triggering carbon emissions, which triggers more warming, which triggers more permafrost thaw, which triggers more carbon emissions,” she said. “You get into this amplifying positive feedback.”
Turetsky and her research colleagues recently estimated that between 60 billion and 100 billion tonnes of carbon could be released by 2300 due to abrupt thawing of ice-rich permafrost in lakes, wetlands and hills in just 20 per cent of the northern permafrost region. That’s not including a projected release of another 200 billion tonnes of carbon from gradual thawing of permafrost elsewhere.
Estimated carbon stored in northern permafrost
Another side effect of this warming could be the release of naturally occurring mercury, which can become harmful to humans and wildlife if it gets into the food chain.
A 2018 study estimates that more than 120 million litres of mercury, the equivalent of about 50 Olympic swimming pools, is stored in permafrost in the Northern Hemisphere.
That’s twice as much mercury than is contained in the world’s soils, atmosphere and ocean combined, said Kevin Schaefer, a co-author of the study and lead scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Centre in Boulder, Colorado.
Under the business-as-usual scenario in which we continue to burn fossil fuels as fast as we can, between a third and 99 per cent of permafrost in the northern hemisphere could thaw out by 2100, Schaefer said.
“Some fraction of that mercury that’s already in the organic matter will be released into the ecosystem ... this could be a risk to food supply and water supplies in the northern hemisphere,” he said.
Scott Dallimore, a research scientist with the Geological Survey of Canada, notes that methane is already leaking into the atmosphere from permafrost on land and under the sea. Dallimore is a leader of a United Nations Environmental Program to assess research needs related to Arctic permafrost and says there is a knowledge gap concerning how much methane is released.
“Given that methane is 30 times more potent as a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide and that methane release from warming permafrost has global implications, we need to know how much is being released and if the rate will increase in the future,” he said.
Territorial governments are already experiencing big headaches as they try to keep up with thawing permafrost that can make driving on roads and highways like riding a roller coaster.
In the Yukon, motorists have to watch for large cracks appearing on the shoulders of the Alaska Highway, which runs northwest from Dawson Creek, B.C., through Whitehorse in the Yukon, to Delta Junction, Alaska.
Paul Murchison, director of transport engineering for the Yukon government, says the highway is built on ice-rich permafrost that is very close to the freezing point, making it especially susceptible to thawing in warmer temperatures.
During the winter, snow accumulates on the shoulders and acts as an insulator, preventing the permafrost from cooling. The ice in the permafrost melts and destabilizes the ground, opening large cracks.
“It’s like you’re breaking the back of the road over the permafrost,” Murchison said.
Farther north in Dawson City, the Yukon River has not been freezing over in winter for the past three years, making the construction of an ice bridge – a vital supply route in the winter – impossible.
In its absence, the community is forced to rely on potentially riskier informal crossings at different locations on the river, said Murchison.
Dealing with these changes has put a strain on budgets, a trend that is expected to continue as temperatures continue to rise.
“We can’t adapt to climate change with the current funding that we have,” Murchison said. “I think you see that across the country.”
Every year, Noella Cockney watches helplessly as the unrelenting waves of the Beaufort Sea cut away at the ground holding up her home.
Cockney estimates that in the last four years alone she has lost about 10 metres of land between the edge of the shore and her red, clapboard house on Beaufort Road in Tuktoyaktuk, an Inuvialuit hamlet of about 900 at the top of the Northwest Territories.
Where once her late father could comfortably drive a front-end loader around the west side of the house, Cockney now can’t even fit her ATV.
“Right now, my front door steps are maybe two, two-and-a-half feet from the drop off of the shore,” she said. “I’m just hoping that there’s not too much west wind this year. If it’s mostly east wind then I’ll be safe. If we have two or three west winds, good blows, I have a feeling my doorstep will fall over the edge.”
Cockney, 51, along with a handful of other residents left on this wind- and wave-battered arm jutting northward from town, are waiting for local officials to start a relocation process that will see the homes loaded onto skids and hauled over the ice to more stable ground.
But time is running out. A few years ago, the hamlet dumped a bunch of boulders along the shore behind her house to try to stop the erosion. It was not enough.
“They just sunk,” said Cockney. “They’re a little farther out into the ocean side and you can’t see them anymore.”
For Tuktoyaktuk mayor Merven Gruben, the erosion on the west coast isn’t new. For years he’s been ringing alarm bells about how climate change is affecting the North, he says.
“I’ve said we were the canary in the coal mine,” said Gruben. “That canary has been dead a long time already.”
Gruben says he hopes a new consultant’s report on erosion affecting the hamlet will help motivate the federal government to part with more funding to address the problem.
“People live on permafrost. It’s basically one big freakin’ ice cube,” he said, noting the most drastic changes he’s seen have been over the last 10 to 15 years.
Already officials have had to move half a dozen homes due to erosion, while another four, including Cockney’s, are in the queue. Gruben has seen what can happen if the town waits too long.
“We’re losing a lot of coastline. Ice just continually melting,” he said. “We had a curling rink at one time in our town and that’s gone into the ocean.”
Dustin Whalen, a coastal geologist with Natural Resources Canada, says Tuktoyaktuk is being hit with a climate-change double-whammy in the form of thawing permafrost, on which the hamlet is built, and more intense wave action due to disappearing sea ice.
“There’s less sea ice, there’s more open water, there’s more erosion,” he said.
Multi-year sea ice in the Beaufort Sea during the summer declined at a rate of approximately seven per cent per decade between 1968 and 2016, according to Canada’s Changing Climate Report. In addition, sea levels around Tuktoyaktuk are projected to rise more than 60 cm by 2100 under a scenario of high greenhouse gas emissions.
Of increasing concern, said Whalen, is Tuktoyaktuk Island, a thin stretch of land about 250 metres from shore that naturally protects the mainland. It is currently eroding at a rate of 2.1 metres per year, he said.
Whalen and colleagues predict that if current climate trends continue, the vulnerable middle of the island will submerge first, effectively cutting the island in half, by the year 2050.
“Then all of a sudden the harbour becomes this huge open water exposed to the open ocean, the impact of waves,” he said. “It’s trouble.”
While the threats posed by thawing permafrost and erosion certainly concern Gruben, he is almost defiant in his outlook.
“Us Inuvialuit people are very adaptable and we go with change,” he said. “We have lots of room to move. We’re by far not sinking into the ocean, that’s for damn sure. We’re always going to be there.” . To celebrate Canada’s 150th birthday, we are exploring all 10 provinces and three territories. Today’s issue is devoted to Nunavut. Watch for our Ontario coverage on Aug. 5.
NEAR ARCTIC BAY, NUNAVUT—Drawn to the Canadian Arctic from four nations around the world, we are united by a singular mission to see a narwhal, dubbed the unicorn of the sea for its long and twisted tusk but also nicknamed the “corpse whale” because some morbid types insist its mottled skin looks like that of a drowned sailor.
We stop cautiously by the floe edge — where the melting winter sea ice meets open Arctic Ocean at Lancaster Sound — and wait for four Inuit guides to make a ruling. Armed with harpoons and a deep understanding of this harsh environment, they poke the ground repeatedly to measure how thick the layered ice is.
They confer and give the thumbs up, then drop a microphone into the water and drape the cord over a harpoon so we can hear underwater through a hydrophone. The rest of the Arctic Kingdom team whips up a cooking tent, wind shelter and bathroom and passes out folding chairs.
Seeing the mythical narwhal migrating to its coastal feeding grounds is paramount to the success or failure of this trip, but each of us — two Canadians, six Americans, four Brits and two Austrians — has multiple motives to have come so far.
To have the wildlife adventure of a lifetime rounded out by polar bears, sea birds and seals. To experience 24-hour sunlight and winter in June. To conquer a fear of camping in yurts on the frozen but melting ocean ice. To see the Arctic before climate change takes a further toll. To live on the literal edge — a.k.a. the floe edge or “line of life” where mammals and birds mingle.
I’m here at the top of the world to scratch an intense itch to visit Canada’s youngest, wildest territory and see the land through Inuit eyes. Those eyes wind up belonging to Dexter Koonoo, Darryl Levi, Justin Muckpa and Apak Taqtu. I devote hours to watching these Arctic Bay men laugh, joke and really enjoy each other’s company.
“The more you laugh,” Koonoo explains, “the less stress you have.”
Layers of stress dissolve during an eight-hour charter flight from Ottawa to Arctic Bay on northern Baffin Island. There is no cell service in the hamlet of 900 and the last Wi-Fi is at the Tangmaarvik Inn before we take a school bus to Victor Bay for a three-hour, 60-kilometre journey to base camp by qamutik (Inuit wooden sleds) pulled by snowmobiles.
Fourteen guests — including vets, police, government workers, businesspeople, a doctor and a business/banking executive — slowly get to know each other and 10 staff. Along with the Inuit guides there is expedition leader Françoise Gervais, assistant expedition leader Vickie Rochon, camp manager Emri Canvin, camp manager in training Norm Rabiscah (from Manitoba and the Cree Nation), and chefs Mathew Sutherland and Andrew Dillon.
The guides are proud family men with large broods. Koonoo is the volunteer fire chief, Levi a singer, Muckpa a carver and Taqtu starred in a documentary called A Boy Among Polar Bears. They love hockey and listen to Rihanna. Our easygoing chats gravitate to food.
Chocolate chip cookies or Oreos, I ask the Arctic Bay boys, who hunt and fish, but also shop at the Northern store and Taqqut Co-op.
“Both.”
Crunchy or smooth peanut butter?
“We don’t like crunchy things.”
Pasta or rice?
“Both.”
Favourite food that comes when the sealift docks in August with dried goods?
“Fresh pop.”
There is no pop (fresh or otherwise) on the sea ice, or alcohol since Nunavut has dry communities and alcohol restrictions, but unlimited tea and coffee is served from heavy-duty green thermoses.
I am drinking Earl Grey and reading a cheap thriller when the narwhal arrive. It is the third day at the floe edge and the cynics among us feared the moment would never come.
“I saw a tusk,” declares an avid “wildlifer” with great binoculars from New York, and everyone whips out cameras, tripods and binoculars and then stops moving so boots crunching on snow don’t scare the narwhal away.
Narwhal “tusks” are actually a tooth that grows through the upper jaw bone. Scientists used to think males used tusks for mating season battles, but discovered they’re covered in nerve endings that help assess the environment. Narwhal are deep divers who feast mainly on halibut, cod and squid and usually travel in small family pods.
The Inuit hunt narwhal for meat, skin and tusks on a quota system and share the meat with the community. There is no hunting allowed on our trip.
We stand in awed silence watching a narwhal pod gracefully pass, gasping whenever one lifts its head and massive tusk straight up from the water.
Loading...
An hour or two later, after the pod is gone and a polar bear that has been stalking us moves away, we don flotation suits and launch inflatable kayaks.
The ocean is still. The sun is making a rare appearance. The stunning silence is broken only by the gentle flutter of thick-billed murre, glaucous gull and guillemot wings, and then by something unfamiliar that sounds like a moan coming out an air hole.
“Narwhal,” Taqtu says quietly.
We can’t see them, so we simply enjoy the fleeting auditory moment.
Everything is fleeting in the Arctic. The temperature hovers just above zero, but wind, snow and fog come and go, and the floe edge constantly changes as pieces break off and float away.
I think a lot about the territory’s “untamed, unspoiled, undiscovered” tourism buzzwords as we watch a polar bear float by on an icy raft. We discover a seal den under the snow, marvel at the large hole seals make to rest on the ice, and examine what’s left of a fresh kill that a polar bear has had its way with and left for the birds.
For our breakfasts and dinners, we gather in the dining tent under laminated maps of Nunavut — the territory is just 18 years old and home to about 37,000 people — and feast on pepper-crusted caribou steaks, dried fruit and roasted nut quinoa, charcuterie, Arctic char Benedicts and sticky date pudding French toast. Lunch is served on the sea ice and is always soup, like tomato with avocado slices and pan-fried bannock.
Anxious about being off the grid, I get a satellite communicator to share my adventure with my family by text, and to have an SOS button if something extreme happens. It doesn’t.
A dog named Boy watches over our camp to sniff out polar bear threats. The camp is safely 20 kilometres from the ice floe and each hour-long journey back and forth brings new discoveries.
Under a “bird cliff” at the edge of Sirmilik National Park, we learn about the northern fulmar. Rochon and Gervais regale us with details on the long-tailed jaegers, black-legged kittiwakes, Arctic terns and king eiders that we see.
“Sometimes it’s good to leave the camera and just enjoy with your eyes,” Gervais gently reminds us.
I am grateful the Inuit guides have agreed to join us in what Gervais calls “the white desert,” since school is out and most families have gone camping to fish for char, hunt narwhal and seal, and go “egg picking” for geese eggs.
It’s beautiful to watch the guides gleefully snorkel, knowing that the Inuit rarely swim except in lakes.
Long-lost feelings — patience, serenity, joy — wash over me during five long days under the midnight sun. I especially love the daily conveys between the ice floe back and base camp in an Inuit sled towed by Koonoo’s snowmobile.
Talk turns to how these men dislike the capital city of Iqaluit (population 8,000 and many creature comforts) because there is “nothing to do,” and how they get just 42 television channels. The kids love Treehouse, but there’s no good movie channel.
“This is our action TV,” Taqtu says, gesturing to Nunavut.
“Adventure? Romance? Comedy? Horror?” I ask.
“Everything is possible,” Koonoo replies. “You’ve just got to wait for it.”

When you go:
We took the Great Migrations of the Northwest Passage trip with Arctic Kingdom (arctickingdom.com). I flew to Ottawa on Air Canada and stayed at the Days Inn Ottawa Airport (daysinnottawa.com) to catch an early charter to Arctic Bay. Our group overnighted at the Tangmaarvik Inn in Arctic Bay before and after camping in yurts on the sea ice. Arctic Kingdom has a variety of small-group trips in Nunavut and northern Manitoba and does custom adventures. . It has not been a good summer for the Arctic.
Perhaps more than anywhere on Earth, the Arctic has felt most acutely the effects of climate change — evidence of which is unfolding in real time as residents and wildlife contend with a mess not of their own making.
While Europeans baked under a few sweltering days in June and July, Arctic residents faced an altogether different paradigm.
A changing Arctic brings problems foreign to those in the south: The inability to travel, the struggle to secure nutritious food, the arrival of new species, the loss of others, and perhaps most damaging, the potential disappearance of one’s culture.
“The people in the North are the most affected from the impact of climate change,” said Mishak Allurut, a community leader in Arctic Bay, Nunavut. “Their whole livelihood revolves around the environment.
Here is a look at how the Arctic and some of its people fared over the past three months while being subjected to some of the hottest weather on record.
Mercury Rising
Parts of the Arctic felt more like Ontario cottage country this summer as the world experienced its hottest June followed by scorching temperatures in July, making it the hottest month since record keeping began in 1880.
Multiple records were smashed in Alert, Nunavut, the northernmost permanent community on Earth. Temperatures hit a record 21 degrees on July 14, breaking the previous record of 20 degrees set in 1956.
“This is an example of what we’re seeing across the entire planet, which are a lot of records being broken, particularly in the maximum temperatures,” said Armel Castellan, a meteorologist with Environment and Climate Change Canada.
The heat refused to let up in Alert as the temperature hit 20.3 degrees on July 15, breaking the previous record of 15.7 degrees for that day set in 1971. The next day, July 16, reached 17.8 degrees to tie the record for that day set back in 2015.
August turned out to be the warmest August on record in Alert by more than one degree, with an average temperature of 4.3 degrees, according to weather watcher Patrick Duplessis, an atmospheric science PhD student at Dalhousie University.
“Beating a monthly average temperature record by a whole degree is quite impressive, especially in summer months, where variability is small,” Duplessis said.
To the south, in Nunavut’s capital Iqaluit, the temperature hit 22.7 degrees on June 28, setting a record for that month, while July 9 – Nunavut Day – was a balmy 23.4 degrees, breaking the previous record of 22.2 degrees set in 1969.
The story was much the same internationally. On July 26, Sweden recorded 34.8 degrees in the village of Markusvinsa, setting that country’s record for the highest temperature inside the Arctic Circle. The next day, the municipality of Saltdal, Norway, saw the mercury hit 34.6 degrees, also the highest temperature ever recorded inside the Arctic Circle in that country.
Alaska recorded its hottest month on record in July, with an average temperature of 14.5 degrees, beating the previous warmest month of July 2004.
Rick Thoman, a climate scientist at the Alaska Centre for Climate Assessment and Policy, said what’s happening in the Arctic “is a preview of things to come for those south of the Arctic. Temperature is on an escalator “going up,” he said. “With the combination of very warm oceans, low sea ice, we loaded the dice and then the atmosphere co-operated by giving us the third piece of the puzzle to push it up yet again.”
On Thin Ice
Earlier this year, Mishak Allurut and some other hunters traveled about 100 kilometres south from their homes in Arctic Bay, Nunavut, to fish for Arctic char, an important food source for the Inuit.
The fish migrate downstream from freshwater to the sea in the spring, so hunters set up their nets on the edge of the ice where the rivers flow into the ocean. One of Allurut’s fellow hunters lost his nets after they slipped into the water when the ice on which they were set melted in just a matter of hours.
“Usually it takes three or four days to have an open area, but this time it took only one,” said Allurut, co-ordinator of the Inuit stewards who manage the waters around Arctic Bay as part of the Nauttiqsuqtiit Tallurutiup Imanga program. Tallurutiup Imanga is a national marine conservation area established this summer around Lancaster Sound in northeastern Nunavut.
“We have to travel on ice to and from our harvesting areas, so, because the ice was melting fast I was worried about travelling back to the community.”
The dangerous ice conditions also meant that his community could harvest just one narwhal this summer; normally they would bring in 20 to 30, he said.
Arctic sea ice coverage reached record or near-record lows this summer. June saw the second-smallest average sea ice coverage for that month, and was also the 20th consecutive June with coverage below average, according to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).
July was worse, with sea ice coverage nearly 20 per cent below the 1981-2010 average, marking the lowest coverage in that month ever recorded.
Loss of ice coverage in August slowed but in some areas, such as the Beaufort and Laptev seas, coverage was more diffuse, with open water between ice floes.
“You’ve got a blue ocean now that you didn’t have before. We’ve never seen anything like this before,” said Mark Serreze, director of the National Snow and Ice Data Centre in Boulder, Colorado.
Unusually, Alaskan waters in the Beaufort Sea were completely clear of sea ice by the first week of August, with the nearest ice about 240 kilometres northeast of Kaktovik, a small coastal city at the top of the state. While ice has been that far from shore before, climate scientist Thoman noted that such a change isn’t expected until much later in the season.
“The main thing about this year is it happened so early,” Thoman said.
Sea ice coverage in the western Canadian Arctic in the last week of August was the fourth-lowest for that week on record since 1981, while coverage in the eastern Canadian Arctic for the same week was the second-lowest on record.
Median ice coverage in the eastern Arctic has historically been around 17 per cent at the end of August.
“Now we’re down to five,” said Gilles Langis, a senior ice forecaster with the Meteorological Service of Canada. “If you compare all the last weeks of August from a historical standpoint, 2011 was the lowest. 2019 was trending very close to that.”
A lack of sea ice contributes to a reduction in the amount of energy from the sun that can be reflected back into space – a process known as the albedo effect, explained Langis. The lighter the surface, the more energy reflected; the darker the surface, the more energy absorbed. “The dark exposed water has a tendency to accelerate the melt in that area because it’s absorbing more incoming radiation,” said Langis.

Fire Alarm
Huge swaths of land across the Arctic were scorched by wildfires unprecedented in their intensity and duration. Clouds of thick smoke and soot fouled the air and blanketed cities in Russia and Alaska.
More than 100 “intense and long-lived” wildfires in the Arctic Circle have been tracked by the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service since the beginning of June. Alaska alone saw more than 690 fires that burned more than a million hectares. In June, fires in Siberia, Alaska, Canada and Greenland released 50 megatonnes of carbon dioxide — equivalent to Sweden’s total annual fossil fuel emissions, according to Mark Parrington, a senior scientist with the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts.
Parrington said this level of emissions was “way above anything we’ve seen in June for the Arctic Circle.” He noted that scientists normally expect to see some fires during summer, but the cluster of fires that started in Siberia in early June was “quite unusual.”
By mid-August, Siberian wildfire smoke covered more than five million square kilometres — an area larger than the European Union, according to the United Nations’ World Meteorological Organization.
The fires have made life particularly uncomfortable for Alaska residents who had to contend with hot, thick, billowing smoke.
“Houses in Alaska, like everywhere in the North, are designed to keep heat in,” said Thoman of the Alaska climate assessment centre. “So when it’s smoky...do you keep the windows closed to keep your air quality better in the house? But then over the course of several days, your house gets warmer and warmer. Or do you let that cooler morning air in and let the smoke in? It becomes kind of a Catch-22.”
Sander Veraverbeke, a forest fire expert at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, said the increasingly warm weather in the Arctic has resulted in more dry vegetation that is susceptible to lightning strikes, which increase in warmer weather. Climate warming also results in what he calls the “shrubification of the Arctic” – increased vegetation that provides more fuel for fires.
In August, several lightning strikes were recorded within 480 kilometres of the North Pole, a rare occurrence that has raised concerns about the amount of heat and moisture in an area that is usually cold and dry.
Wildlife
On the northwest coast of Alaska thousands of walruses, unable to find floating sea ice on which to tend to their young, are crowding onto land.
The walruses, mostly females and dependent young, gathered in late July on the shores of a barrier island close to Point Lay, an Inupiat village on the Chukchi Sea coast. Ice cover on the Chukchi Sea was the lowest ever for that month, according to the International Arctic Research Centre at the University of Alaska.
While walruses have come ashore at Point Lay in recent years, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service spokesperson Andrea Medeiros said previously large numbers of the marine mammal had not been reported there until early August.
“Walruses are easily disturbed by unusual sights, sounds and odours when hauled out on land,” said Medeiros. “A disturbance can cause the walruses to stampede into the water and result in injuries or the deaths of animals.”
Scientists are baffled by a spike in strandings of gray whales in the Chukchi and Bering seas and farther south along the west coast. In what the NOAA is calling an “Unusual Mortality Event,” 208 gray whales washed up along the coasts of Mexico, U.S. and Canada this year, including 40 in Alaska and 10 in British Columbia. Between 2000 and 2018, the average number of annual gray whale strandings was about 12.
After giving birth in Mexican waters during the winter, gray whales migrate north during summer to feed in the Arctic. According to the NOAA, many of the whales stranded this year were skinny and malnourished.
Kate Savage, a veterinarian and biologist with NOAA Fisheries in Juneau, Alaska, said scientists don’t yet know why the whales are dying. An international team is trying to figure out what’s going on, she said, adding that four necropsies have been completed in Alaska, but the results aren’t in yet.
She said that while animals that depend on the Bering Sea and the Arctic for their survival will likely be impacted by climate change, the deaths of the gray whales have not been been linked to climate change or any other cause.
Greenland is Melting
In late July, a mass of warm air from Africa delivered record-breaking temperatures to Europe, including the U.K., Germany, and the Netherlands. It then travelled northwest to Greenland’s ice sheet where it caused what NASA called a “major melting event” that saw billions of tonnes of ice melt and stream into the Atlantic Ocean.
On July 31, Greenland lost more than 10 billion tonnes of ice from surface melt with 56 per cent of the ice sheet experiencing at least one millimetre of melt at the surface, according to Polar Portal, a website run by Danish research institutions.
About 80 per cent of the island’s surface is covered by the ice sheet.
For July as a whole, the island had a net loss of 197 billion tonnes of ice, which contributed to half a millimetre of sea level rise, according to scientists at the Danish Meteorological Institute.
The trend continued with more than 10 billion tonnes lost on each of the first two days of August. Martin Stendel, a climate scientist with the Institute, noted on Twitter that the amount of ice that melted from the surface of the ice sheet on July 31 and Aug. 1 “would be enough to cover Florida with almost five inches of water.”
On July 30 and 31, temperatures at Summit Station, a research camp at the top of Greenland’s ice sheet (3,216 metres above sea level), rose to above freezing.
“This was the first time that we know there were back-to-back days of melting at Summit Station,” said Christopher Shuman, a glaciologist at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. He said temperatures remained above freezing for 11 hours on the 30th and about five-and-a-half hours the next day.
“It is not a good sign for an ice sheet that is clearly out of balance.” . The silent thaw creeps ever deeper like the unseen roots of some great tree.
Year after year, the ground across much of Canada’s Arctic is getting softer, turning to mud, falling into seas and rivers.
Permafrost, the glue that holds together so much of the north’s landscape – sometimes referred to by scientists as “nature’s freezer” – is warming up.
The changes come slowly, but the effects are dramatic – when we can see them.
In Nunavut, water and sewer pipes in the capital Iqaluit are cracking during the winter as the ground shifts – costing the city hundreds of thousands of dollars in repairs. In Nunavik, the northern third of Quebec, ponds and lakes are “browning” as thawing permafrost deposits organic matter into the water. In the west, cracks large enough to swallow a man have opened on the Alaska Highway in the Yukon. Great chunks of soil and ice are falling off coastline in the Northwest Territories and tumbling into the Beaufort Sea.
But permafrost thaw is just one symptom of a warming climate wreaking havoc in Canada’s Arctic. Thick, multi-year sea ice is disappearing, only to be replaced by thin seasonal ice; open, ice-free water is coming sooner and lasting longer; snow cover is increasing in some areas, decreasing in others; animal and plant species not seen by residents in the past are turning up, while others are disappearing.
Cumulatively, these changes are profoundly affecting the ways of life and traditions of Indigenous peoples of the north, who rely on the ice, land and sea.
“Indeed our identity is strongly linked to the ice, cold and snow,” said Siila Watt-Cloutier, an Inuit environmental, cultural and human rights advocate and author of the book The Right to be Cold. “Our right to hunt, our right to health, our right to educate our children, our right to safety and security … in fact, all of our human rights as Indigenous peoples would be minimized and destroyed by climate change.”
The Arctic has been described as Canada’s canary in a coal mine by Inuit residents and scientists alike when it comes to climate change.
Between 1948 and 2016, the annual mean temperature in Canada’s north increased by 2.3 degrees, about three times the global rate, federal scientists recently concluded. They also predict that even if global greenhouse gas emissions are reduced, average winter temperatures will rise by as much as 4 degrees in the Arctic by 2050. Under a scenario in which emissions continue to rise, average winter temperatures could rise by as much as 7 degrees.
Mean winter temperature increases across Canada between 1948 and 2016
Eventually, southern Canada will begin to experience similar temperature increases in winter between the years 2081 and 2100, according to the projections.
“What happens in the Arctic doesn’t stay in the Arctic,” said Watt-Cloutier.
“The people who are on the ground still sourcing their food from nature and who are connected to nature become not only the guardians, but we become the sentinels for the rest of the planet.”
About five years ago, Don Coughlin noticed that the rubber seals around the windows of his Iqaluit home were failing. The windows misted as moisture penetrated the spaces between the panes of his double- and triple-glazed windows.
The 67-year-old retiree then noticed that his back door wasn’t closing properly. He began to suspect thawing permafrost under his house.
“It’s the only thing that could do it,” said Coughlin, noting that in the 48 years since he moved to Nunavut, he has noticed warmer winter temperatures and earlier ice break-ups on Frobisher Bay. “Everything’s changing for sure.”
Like most homes in Iqaluit, Coughlin’s is built on piles – long steel pipes drilled deep into the permafrost (or bedrock if it can be reached).
Permafrost has what is known as the active layer, the top portion of soil that freezes during the winter and thaws in the summer. Ideally, piles go deeper than the active layer to fuse with the solid, permanently frozen permafrost below. Locked in, the piles keep structures level even as temperatures in the active layer change.
But warmer weather is increasing the depth of the active layer and warming the permafrost below.
This can cause piles to shift up and down, buckling floors, cracking walls and warping door and window frames of the buildings above.
In the crawlspace under his home, Coughlin found most of the piles holding up his house were uneven. Some had heaved up by more than two inches. He also found that a wood beam holding up his house was warped due to the pressure exerted by the moving piles.
“If we wanted to sell (the house), it would be harder and we’d get a much lower price because of it,” he said.
Coughlin estimates it could cost as much as $50,000 to re-level his home.
Piles holding up people’s homes aren’t the only crucial pieces of infrastructure being affected by thawing permafrost.
The City of Iqaluit has in recent years been burying its water and sewer pipes deeper and deeper in the hope of avoiding the movement caused by the freezing and thawing in the active layer.
Over the last 10 years, water pipes buried in the ground have begun to move and crack with increasing frequency as the active layer has grown, says Iqaluit mayor Madeleine Redfern. Since January, the city of 8,000 has seen four significant water line breaks.
“One of the pipes that broke was 17 feet below the surface, and it took over a week for the heavy machinery to even reach the pipe,” Redfern said. “Quite a number of our residents were without water not just for hours, but in some cases days.”
The city spent over $300,000 this past winter to tackle the problem. “That’s a lot on a municipal budget of just over $40 million,” she said.
Permafrost, defined as ground containing ice, soil, peat and rocks that stays frozen for a minimum of two years, underlies about 50 per cent of Canada.
Permafrost distribution in Canada
Between 2014 and 2017, the Iqaluit International Airport underwent $300 million worth of improvements, including a new terminal and lighting system. A significant portion of the funds was spent to repair runways and taxiways that had cracked and warped due to ice-rich permafrost thaw. One of the taxiways was so deformed, jets couldn’t use it.
Michel Allard, a permafrost expert and a professor in the geography department at Université Laval, created a permafrost and geology map of Iqaluit and discovered that the airport was built on top of a network of ice wedges – v-shaped bodies of ice that vertically taper downward into the permafrost.
In warmer weather, ice wedges thaw, causing the ground to sink.
Cracks in the runway and taxiways had to be excavated and filled with styrofoam insulation before the surface was repaved during the upgrades.
“The big issue is if climate warming continues, eventually the active layer will get deeper,” said Allard. “We can expect that the damage will start to occur again ... it is going to be sensitive to climate warming. There is no escape.”
Across town, local athletes were dealt a blow when city staff discovered in 2003 that a section of the two-year-old Arctic Winter Games Arena ice pad was sinking and shifting due to thawing permafrost. The rink was out of commission for seven years while the city tore up the concrete pad, installed a new foundation of piles drilled deep into the ground and built a steel grid floor at a cost of $2.2 million.
Since it’s reopening in 2010, there haven’t been any problems, but pavement in the parking lot is starting to sink.
Redfern says there is a mismatch between the criteria to access federal funds for climate change projects and what her community needs.
“The vast majority of climate change programs are focused on reducing greenhouse gas emissions,” she noted. “Not to say that those initiatives aren’t important, but the reality is that we’re dealing with climate change effects now.”
Redfern said a lack of precipitation last year led to the alarming possibility that the amount of water in Iqaluit’s reservoir, Lake Geraldine, would be insufficient to meet demand. The city spent millions of dollars pumping water from a nearby river to replenish the reservoir.
Redfern says that when the city tried to get funding to address the water shortage, “we were being told by different federal officials and bureaucrats, ‘No, no, no ... There’s more precipitation.’”
“Canada’s Arctic is four million square kilometres. It’s not uniform,” she said.
Last year, the Office of the Auditor General of Canada found that the territorial government had not fully assessed the risks of a changing climate by, for example, failing to identify communities at greatest risk and determine how climate change was affecting biodiversity.
“Climate change is such a large subject area and it has been hard to prioritize activities,” said Sara Holzman, acting climate change adaptation manager with the Nunavut government.
She said the territory is working with its federal counterparts “to help them develop programs that work for us in the North.”
Allen Gordon doesn’t dare cross the Koksoak River for the annual spring goose hunt anymore.
Not since that May evening in the mid-1990s when he and a friend crossed the river while returning from goose blinds about 10 kilometres from their homes in Kuujjuaq, a village of about 2,800 in Nunavik, the northernmost region of Quebec.
The pair were crossing the river near Old Fort Chimo, a trading post set up by the Hudson’s Bay Company in the 1830s. They noticed that the ice was cracked, thin and moving. The next day, the ice broke up, much earlier in the season than it had in the past.
“That scared us,” said Gordon, an Inuit guide and executive director of the Nunavik Tourism Association. “We used to have absolutely no worries going down that way … With the warming of the temperature, we didn’t realize, we were still thinking it was still safe like before.”
Gordon never went back. Since then, he says the river, which used to stay frozen until the second week of June, has been breaking up in May.
A 2011 study forecast that sea ice in Hudson Bay and surrounding water bodies will become about 50 per cent thinner on average in the Hudson Strait and Ungava Bay between 2041 and 2070 when compared to 1961-1990.
Farther north, the prognosis isn’t any better.
According to Canada’s Changing Climate Report, released this year by Environment and Climate Change Canada, continued reductions in sea ice area can be expected across the Canadian Arctic during summer and most Arctic marine regions will have no sea ice for part of the summer by 2050.
This is caused by a longer melt season thanks to warmer temperatures in the spring. The resulting dark, open water absorbs more radiation from the sun and becomes warmer. This in turn results in later fall freeze-ups.
This is not new. From 1968 to 2015, summer sea ice area decreased at a rate of between five and 20 per cent per decade, depending on region, across the Canadian Arctic, according to the report.
Gordon says declining sea ice on Ungava Bay is resulting in big changes.
Ringed seals, which Inuit rely on for meat and skins, need sea ice to create snow burrows where they give birth to their pups.
“But with no more sea ice being frozen thick enough, the seals have moved away,” he said.
Now, polar bears, which eat seals, are coming ashore to look for different food sources, Gordon said. “We’re actually seeing more than ever.”
Watt-Cloutier, who also lives in Kuujjuaq, says snow and ice are integral parts of Inuit identity.
“That allows us to go out and hunt in our organic supermarkets, which is out on the land and the ice to feed our families,” she said. “This is who we are. We are still hunters. We’re still fishers. We’re still gatherers. Even though we have modern work days, we are still a people very, very connected to our way of life.”
In 2005, as chair of the Inuit Circumpolar Conference, Watt-Cloutier launched a petition addressed to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, alleging that global warming due to greenhouse gas emissions from the United States violated Inuit human rights. Supported by testimony from more than five dozen Inuit hunters and elders from northern Canada and Alaska, the petition, which ultimately failed, described how global warming was destroying the environment and their hunting-based culture.
“Governments have all the right rhetoric when they’re campaigning, but they certainly aren’t doing the right thing in terms of protecting many of the lands of Indigenous people,” she said.
Some 2,000 kilometres northwest of Nunavik, where the M’Clure Strait opens into the vast expanse of the Beaufort Sea, lies the westernmost island of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, Banks Island.
Here on this cold, remote land mass in the Northwest Territories, virtually uninhabited by humans (the population hovers close to 100), scientists keep a close watch as the effects of climate change unfold.
In his 43 years of studying permafrost in the Arctic, Antoni Lewkowicz, a geography professor at the University of Ottawa and president of the Canadian Permafrost Association, has seen the impacts of climate change first-hand but not to the magnitude he and fellow researcher Robert Way discovered recently on Banks Island.
Using satellite images of the island taken over 31 years, the researchers discovered a 60-fold growth in the number of landslides caused by melting ground ice in permafrost. These landslides, known as “retrogressive thaw slumps,” or RTS, increased from 63 in 1984 to 3,942 in 2015, with a maximum of 4,077 observed in 2013.
They predict that after 2075, more than 10,000 new retrogressive thaw slumps will appear every decade on the island as the climate continues to warm.
“My emotion was mostly astonishment at the degree and importance of the change,” said Lewkowicz, noting that his findings linked the changes to warm summers.
Thaw slumps are being documented throughout northwestern Canada and Alaska.
In warm temperatures, the active layer thaws more rapidly and deeply into the frozen, ancient permafrost below.
Soil and mud in the active layer becomes dislodged and slides or oozes away, exposing the ice within the permafrost. Once the ice is exposed on these newly formed slopes, known as headwalls, it begins to melt.
Depending on the temperature, headwalls can retreat by as many as 10 to 15 metres per year, cratering the land. The displaced sediments can impact water quality in streams and lakes, contribute to coastal erosion, and disrupt traditional Indigenous travel routes.
“Climate warming means that what used to be extreme is becoming more common and what used to be impossible is now becoming possible,” Lewkowicz said.
A byproduct of thawing permafrost is the release of carbon from decaying organic materials that have accumulated in the frozen ground over thousands of years. Scientists estimate that almost 1.7 trillion tonnes of organic carbon is stored in northern permafrost – twice as much carbon as there is in the atmosphere.
When permafrost thaws, microbes break down this organic material, releasing both carbon dioxide and methane into the atmosphere. Together, these two greenhouse gases contribute to what Guelph University ecosystem ecologist Merritt Turetsky calls “Arctic amplification” of climate change.
“Permafrost thaw is triggering carbon emissions, which triggers more warming, which triggers more permafrost thaw, which triggers more carbon emissions,” she said. “You get into this amplifying positive feedback.”
Turetsky and her research colleagues recently estimated that between 60 billion and 100 billion tonnes of carbon could be released by 2300 due to abrupt thawing of ice-rich permafrost in lakes, wetlands and hills in just 20 per cent of the northern permafrost region. That’s not including a projected release of another 200 billion tonnes of carbon from gradual thawing of permafrost elsewhere.
Estimated carbon stored in northern permafrost
Another side effect of this warming could be the release of naturally occurring mercury, which can become harmful to humans and wildlife if it gets into the food chain.
A 2018 study estimates that more than 120 million litres of mercury, the equivalent of about 50 Olympic swimming pools, is stored in permafrost in the Northern Hemisphere.
That’s twice as much mercury than is contained in the world’s soils, atmosphere and ocean combined, said Kevin Schaefer, a co-author of the study and lead scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Centre in Boulder, Colorado.
Under the business-as-usual scenario in which we continue to burn fossil fuels as fast as we can, between a third and 99 per cent of permafrost in the northern hemisphere could thaw out by 2100, Schaefer said.
“Some fraction of that mercury that’s already in the organic matter will be released into the ecosystem ... this could be a risk to food supply and water supplies in the northern hemisphere,” he said.
Scott Dallimore, a research scientist with the Geological Survey of Canada, notes that methane is already leaking into the atmosphere from permafrost on land and under the sea. Dallimore is a leader of a United Nations Environmental Program to assess research needs related to Arctic permafrost and says there is a knowledge gap concerning how much methane is released.
“Given that methane is 30 times more potent as a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide and that methane release from warming permafrost has global implications, we need to know how much is being released and if the rate will increase in the future,” he said.
Territorial governments are already experiencing big headaches as they try to keep up with thawing permafrost that can make driving on roads and highways like riding a roller coaster.
In the Yukon, motorists have to watch for large cracks appearing on the shoulders of the Alaska Highway, which runs northwest from Dawson Creek, B.C., through Whitehorse in the Yukon, to Delta Junction, Alaska.
Paul Murchison, director of transport engineering for the Yukon government, says the highway is built on ice-rich permafrost that is very close to the freezing point, making it especially susceptible to thawing in warmer temperatures.
During the winter, snow accumulates on the shoulders and acts as an insulator, preventing the permafrost from cooling. The ice in the permafrost melts and destabilizes the ground, opening large cracks.
“It’s like you’re breaking the back of the road over the permafrost,” Murchison said.
Farther north in Dawson City, the Yukon River has not been freezing over in winter for the past three years, making the construction of an ice bridge – a vital supply route in the winter – impossible.
In its absence, the community is forced to rely on potentially riskier informal crossings at different locations on the river, said Murchison.
Dealing with these changes has put a strain on budgets, a trend that is expected to continue as temperatures continue to rise.
“We can’t adapt to climate change with the current funding that we have,” Murchison said. “I think you see that across the country.”
Every year, Noella Cockney watches helplessly as the unrelenting waves of the Beaufort Sea cut away at the ground holding up her home.
Cockney estimates that in the last four years alone she has lost about 10 metres of land between the edge of the shore and her red, clapboard house on Beaufort Road in Tuktoyaktuk, an Inuvialuit hamlet of about 900 at the top of the Northwest Territories.
Where once her late father could comfortably drive a front-end loader around the west side of the house, Cockney now can’t even fit her ATV.
“Right now, my front door steps are maybe two, two-and-a-half feet from the drop off of the shore,” she said. “I’m just hoping that there’s not too much west wind this year. If it’s mostly east wind then I’ll be safe. If we have two or three west winds, good blows, I have a feeling my doorstep will fall over the edge.”
Cockney, 51, along with a handful of other residents left on this wind- and wave-battered arm jutting northward from town, are waiting for local officials to start a relocation process that will see the homes loaded onto skids and hauled over the ice to more stable ground.
But time is running out. A few years ago, the hamlet dumped a bunch of boulders along the shore behind her house to try to stop the erosion. It was not enough.
“They just sunk,” said Cockney. “They’re a little farther out into the ocean side and you can’t see them anymore.”
For Tuktoyaktuk mayor Merven Gruben, the erosion on the west coast isn’t new. For years he’s been ringing alarm bells about how climate change is affecting the North, he says.
“I’ve said we were the canary in the coal mine,” said Gruben. “That canary has been dead a long time already.”
Gruben says he hopes a new consultant’s report on erosion affecting the hamlet will help motivate the federal government to part with more funding to address the problem.
“People live on permafrost. It’s basically one big freakin’ ice cube,” he said, noting the most drastic changes he’s seen have been over the last 10 to 15 years.
Already officials have had to move half a dozen homes due to erosion, while another four, including Cockney’s, are in the queue. Gruben has seen what can happen if the town waits too long.
“We’re losing a lot of coastline. Ice just continually melting,” he said. “We had a curling rink at one time in our town and that’s gone into the ocean.”
Dustin Whalen, a coastal geologist with Natural Resources Canada, says Tuktoyaktuk is being hit with a climate-change double-whammy in the form of thawing permafrost, on which the hamlet is built, and more intense wave action due to disappearing sea ice.
“There’s less sea ice, there’s more open water, there’s more erosion,” he said.
Multi-year sea ice in the Beaufort Sea during the summer declined at a rate of approximately seven per cent per decade between 1968 and 2016, according to Canada’s Changing Climate Report. In addition, sea levels around Tuktoyaktuk are projected to rise more than 60 cm by 2100 under a scenario of high greenhouse gas emissions.
Of increasing concern, said Whalen, is Tuktoyaktuk Island, a thin stretch of land about 250 metres from shore that naturally protects the mainland. It is currently eroding at a rate of 2.1 metres per year, he said.
Whalen and colleagues predict that if current climate trends continue, the vulnerable middle of the island will submerge first, effectively cutting the island in half, by the year 2050.
“Then all of a sudden the harbour becomes this huge open water exposed to the open ocean, the impact of waves,” he said. “It’s trouble.”
While the threats posed by thawing permafrost and erosion certainly concern Gruben, he is almost defiant in his outlook.
“Us Inuvialuit people are very adaptable and we go with change,” he said. “We have lots of room to move. We’re by far not sinking into the ocean, that’s for damn sure. We’re always going to be there.” . To celebrate Canada’s 150th birthday, we are exploring all 10 provinces and three territories. Today’s issue is devoted to Nunavut. Watch for our Ontario coverage on Aug. 5.
NEAR ARCTIC BAY, NUNAVUT—Drawn to the Canadian Arctic from four nations around the world, we are united by a singular mission to see a narwhal, dubbed the unicorn of the sea for its long and twisted tusk but also nicknamed the “corpse whale” because some morbid types insist its mottled skin looks like that of a drowned sailor.
We stop cautiously by the floe edge — where the melting winter sea ice meets open Arctic Ocean at Lancaster Sound — and wait for four Inuit guides to make a ruling. Armed with harpoons and a deep understanding of this harsh environment, they poke the ground repeatedly to measure how thick the layered ice is.
They confer and give the thumbs up, then drop a microphone into the water and drape the cord over a harpoon so we can hear underwater through a hydrophone. The rest of the Arctic Kingdom team whips up a cooking tent, wind shelter and bathroom and passes out folding chairs.
Seeing the mythical narwhal migrating to its coastal feeding grounds is paramount to the success or failure of this trip, but each of us — two Canadians, six Americans, four Brits and two Austrians — has multiple motives to have come so far.
To have the wildlife adventure of a lifetime rounded out by polar bears, sea birds and seals. To experience 24-hour sunlight and winter in June. To conquer a fear of camping in yurts on the frozen but melting ocean ice. To see the Arctic before climate change takes a further toll. To live on the literal edge — a.k.a. the floe edge or “line of life” where mammals and birds mingle.
I’m here at the top of the world to scratch an intense itch to visit Canada’s youngest, wildest territory and see the land through Inuit eyes. Those eyes wind up belonging to Dexter Koonoo, Darryl Levi, Justin Muckpa and Apak Taqtu. I devote hours to watching these Arctic Bay men laugh, joke and really enjoy each other’s company.
“The more you laugh,” Koonoo explains, “the less stress you have.”
Layers of stress dissolve during an eight-hour charter flight from Ottawa to Arctic Bay on northern Baffin Island. There is no cell service in the hamlet of 900 and the last Wi-Fi is at the Tangmaarvik Inn before we take a school bus to Victor Bay for a three-hour, 60-kilometre journey to base camp by qamutik (Inuit wooden sleds) pulled by snowmobiles.
Fourteen guests — including vets, police, government workers, businesspeople, a doctor and a business/banking executive — slowly get to know each other and 10 staff. Along with the Inuit guides there is expedition leader Françoise Gervais, assistant expedition leader Vickie Rochon, camp manager Emri Canvin, camp manager in training Norm Rabiscah (from Manitoba and the Cree Nation), and chefs Mathew Sutherland and Andrew Dillon.
The guides are proud family men with large broods. Koonoo is the volunteer fire chief, Levi a singer, Muckpa a carver and Taqtu starred in a documentary called A Boy Among Polar Bears. They love hockey and listen to Rihanna. Our easygoing chats gravitate to food.
Chocolate chip cookies or Oreos, I ask the Arctic Bay boys, who hunt and fish, but also shop at the Northern store and Taqqut Co-op.
“Both.”
Crunchy or smooth peanut butter?
“We don’t like crunchy things.”
Pasta or rice?
“Both.”
Favourite food that comes when the sealift docks in August with dried goods?
“Fresh pop.”
There is no pop (fresh or otherwise) on the sea ice, or alcohol since Nunavut has dry communities and alcohol restrictions, but unlimited tea and coffee is served from heavy-duty green thermoses.
I am drinking Earl Grey and reading a cheap thriller when the narwhal arrive. It is the third day at the floe edge and the cynics among us feared the moment would never come.
“I saw a tusk,” declares an avid “wildlifer” with great binoculars from New York, and everyone whips out cameras, tripods and binoculars and then stops moving so boots crunching on snow don’t scare the narwhal away.
Narwhal “tusks” are actually a tooth that grows through the upper jaw bone. Scientists used to think males used tusks for mating season battles, but discovered they’re covered in nerve endings that help assess the environment. Narwhal are deep divers who feast mainly on halibut, cod and squid and usually travel in small family pods.
The Inuit hunt narwhal for meat, skin and tusks on a quota system and share the meat with the community. There is no hunting allowed on our trip.
We stand in awed silence watching a narwhal pod gracefully pass, gasping whenever one lifts its head and massive tusk straight up from the water.
Loading...
An hour or two later, after the pod is gone and a polar bear that has been stalking us moves away, we don flotation suits and launch inflatable kayaks.
The ocean is still. The sun is making a rare appearance. The stunning silence is broken only by the gentle flutter of thick-billed murre, glaucous gull and guillemot wings, and then by something unfamiliar that sounds like a moan coming out an air hole.
“Narwhal,” Taqtu says quietly.
We can’t see them, so we simply enjoy the fleeting auditory moment.
Everything is fleeting in the Arctic. The temperature hovers just above zero, but wind, snow and fog come and go, and the floe edge constantly changes as pieces break off and float away.
I think a lot about the territory’s “untamed, unspoiled, undiscovered” tourism buzzwords as we watch a polar bear float by on an icy raft. We discover a seal den under the snow, marvel at the large hole seals make to rest on the ice, and examine what’s left of a fresh kill that a polar bear has had its way with and left for the birds.
For our breakfasts and dinners, we gather in the dining tent under laminated maps of Nunavut — the territory is just 18 years old and home to about 37,000 people — and feast on pepper-crusted caribou steaks, dried fruit and roasted nut quinoa, charcuterie, Arctic char Benedicts and sticky date pudding French toast. Lunch is served on the sea ice and is always soup, like tomato with avocado slices and pan-fried bannock.
Anxious about being off the grid, I get a satellite communicator to share my adventure with my family by text, and to have an SOS button if something extreme happens. It doesn’t.
A dog named Boy watches over our camp to sniff out polar bear threats. The camp is safely 20 kilometres from the ice floe and each hour-long journey back and forth brings new discoveries.
Under a “bird cliff” at the edge of Sirmilik National Park, we learn about the northern fulmar. Rochon and Gervais regale us with details on the long-tailed jaegers, black-legged kittiwakes, Arctic terns and king eiders that we see.
“Sometimes it’s good to leave the camera and just enjoy with your eyes,” Gervais gently reminds us.
I am grateful the Inuit guides have agreed to join us in what Gervais calls “the white desert,” since school is out and most families have gone camping to fish for char, hunt narwhal and seal, and go “egg picking” for geese eggs.
It’s beautiful to watch the guides gleefully snorkel, knowing that the Inuit rarely swim except in lakes.
Long-lost feelings — patience, serenity, joy — wash over me during five long days under the midnight sun. I especially love the daily conveys between the ice floe back and base camp in an Inuit sled towed by Koonoo’s snowmobile.
Talk turns to how these men dislike the capital city of Iqaluit (population 8,000 and many creature comforts) because there is “nothing to do,” and how they get just 42 television channels. The kids love Treehouse, but there’s no good movie channel.
“This is our action TV,” Taqtu says, gesturing to Nunavut.
“Adventure? Romance? Comedy? Horror?” I ask.
“Everything is possible,” Koonoo replies. “You’ve just got to wait for it.”

Abstract
Objectives
Nunavut is an Arctic territory in Canada subject to many social, economic and health disparities in comparison to the rest of the nation. The territory is affected by health care provision challenges caused by small, geographically isolated communities where staffing shortages and weather related access barriers are common concerns. In addition to national universal healthcare, the majority of the inhabitants of Nunavut (~85 %) are Inuit beneficiaries of no-charge pharmaceuticals provided through federal and/or territorial budgetary allocations. This research examines how existing pharmaceutical administration and distribution policies and practices in Nunavut impact patient care.
Methods
This grounded theory research includes document analysis and semi-structured interviews conducted in 2013/14 with patients, health care providers, administrators and policy makers in several communities in Nunavut. Thirty five informants in total participated in the study. Interviews were audiotaped, transcribed and analyzed with qualitative data analysis software for internal consistency and emerging themes.
Results
Four distinct themes emerge from the research that have the potential to impact patient care and which may provide direction for future policy development: 1) tensions between national versus territorial financial responsibilities influence health provider decisions that may affect patient care, 2) significant human resources are utilized in Community Health Centres to perform distribution duties associated with retail pharmacy medications, 3) large quantities of unclaimed prescription medications are suggestive of significant financial losses, suboptimal patient care and low adherence rates, and 4) the absence of a clear policy and oversight for some controlled substances, such as narcotics, leaves communities at risk for potential illegal procurement or abuse.
Conclusions
Addressing these issues in future policy development may result in system-wide economic benefits, improved patient care and adherence, and reduced risk to communities. The interview informants who participated in this research are best positioned to identify issues in need of attention and will benefit the most from policy development to address their concerns.
Introduction
Profile of Nunavut
Stark contrasts are commonplace in the Arctic, where light and land, and tradition and modernity mix to create unique landscapes. The Arctic territory of Nunavut is the largest, least populated and newest territory in Canada, created from negotiations between the federal government and the Aboriginal Inuit inhabitants of the region in 1999; as such, 85 % of the population of Nunavut are Inuit [1]. In contrast to Canada’s high income and development measures, Nunavut demonstrates substantially deficient indicators for health and social and economic development. Nunavut’s epidemiological profile includes disproportionately high levels of many infectious and chronic diseases, as well as high age-standardized mortality rates (603 in Nunavut versus 259 in Canada, per 100,000), suicide rates (56.9 in Nunavut versus 10.4 in Canada, per 100,000) and infant mortality rates (16.1 in Nunavut versus 5.1 in Canada, per 1,000 live births) [2]. Life expectancy at birth differentials between Nunavut and the rest of Canada are seven years for women (76 years versus 83 years, respectively) and nine years for men (69 years versus 78 years, respectively) [3]. Nunavut is also affected by social issues such as poverty (the Nunavut average household income is 10 % lower than the Canadian average while household food expenditures are three times the national average), unemployment (46.2 % employment rate for working-age Inuit), food insecurity (>70 % of households in Nunavut versus 9 % in Canada), and low educational attainment (27.5 % high school graduation rate from 1999 to 2008) [4]. Additionally, high birth rates (2.97 children per woman versus 1.61 per woman for Canada in 2011) and overcrowded housing (52.7 % live in crowded housing versus 3 % in the rest of Canada) have significant impacts on health measures and service needs [5, 6]. The Community Well-Being Index (CWB) is a composite measure developed by the Canadian Department of Indian and Northern Affairs, which considers income, education, housing and labour-force participation. In the Canadian northern territories, the average CWB score for Aboriginal communities is 62.0, whereas for the rest of Canada the average CWB score is 74.2 [3].
Health care in Nunavut is delivered in Community Health Centres (CHCs) through a nurse-led primary care delivery model with services being provided predominantly by community health nurses (CHNs); the vast majority of CHNs are non-Inuit originally from the south [7]. The territory of Nunavut is divided administratively into three regions: the Kivalliq in the southwest, the Kitikmeot in the northwest, and the Qikiqtaaluk in the east. The two western regions each have a Regional Health Centre with limited in-patient capacity and extended diagnostic testing services (Rankin Inlet in the Kivalliq and Cambridge Bay in the Kitikmeot). The territorial hospital (Qikiqtani General Hospital) is located in the capital of Iqaluit in the Qikiqtaaluk. Each of the remaining 22 communities is serviced by a CHC. Regional Health Centres are distribution hubs for CHC medications, with Qikiqtani General Hospital serving centralized ordering and administration roles. At the CHCs, medications are compounded and/or dispensed by health providers from bulk containers into smaller amounts for individual patients as required. For prescribed medications that are not provided by the CHCs, there are five retail pharmacies within the territory: two in Iqaluit, two in Rankin Inlet and one in Cambridge Bay. In communities without a retail pharmacy, all prescribed medications are dispensed by the closest regional retail pharmacy, flown into the community and delivered directly to the CHC for distribution to community members.
This disparity, of an underdeveloped territory situated within a nation enjoying high development indicators more generally, creates a unique contrasting backdrop for pharmaceutical service provisions. Provinces and territories are responsible for the provision of health services in accordance with Canada’s publicly funded universal health care program. The Government of Nunavut (GN) funds primary and hospital care and inpatient pharmaceuticals in accordance with the GN Drug Formulary Manual. These pharmaceuticals (referred to as wardstock) are defined as those that are used “at the time of care in a health centre, hospital or public health unit, as well as may be provided in a small supply to treat patients for a short period after the patient returns home” [8]. Canada’s universal health care program does not extend to outpatient prescription pharmaceuticals or over the counter (OTC) medications. However, as the majority of the population of Nunavut are Inuit, they are beneficiaries of the Non-Insured Health Benefits (NIHB) Program for First Nations and Inuit. These benefits encompass many health-related goods and services including 100 % coverage for most outpatient prescription pharmaceuticals and many OTCs not covered by the GN; these medications are dispensed from retail pharmacies [9]. This broad sweeping medical coverage is the result of historical treaties signed between Aboriginal groups and the Canadian federal government in the 1870s which included references to a “medicine chest” clause agreeing to provide medical care and medicines to the Aboriginal peoples who had signed the treaties [10].
Financial expenditures
Federal funding for the NIHB program is allocated from the First Nations and Inuit Health Branch (FNIHB), as well as from supplementary Parliamentary funding which may be provided throughout the fiscal year. The NIHB program registered 926,044 First Nations and Inuit clients in 2013 with a total budget in 2012/13 of $1.104 billion. Of total NIHB registered clients, 42,911 (4.6 %) were Inuit and pharmacy costs represented the largest proportion (41.9 %) of total expenditures at $462.7 million [11]. National level challenges to control pharmaceutical expenses include issues such as an aging population and increased reliance on pharmaceuticals [11]. Research indicates that due to higher levels of chronic disease, older individuals are prescribed more pharmaceuticals at higher costs than younger individuals [12]. Challenges specific to the NIHB program sustainability include population growth rates in its client base that are double that of the national average (Nunavut has the highest fertility rate in the country), and providing service to clients in remote and small communities [11]. The remoteness of Arctic communities provides unique challenges for pharmacy expenditure management (e.g. control of inventory levels) and oversight.
The NIHB Annual Report for 2012/13 indicates that pharmacy utilization rates - expressed as clients receiving at least one pharmacy benefit throughout the year as a proportion of the total number of eligible clients - are substantially lower in Nunavut (~45 %) than national NIHB averages (~62 %). In fact, Nunavut has the lowest utilization rates of all NIHB regions. This relatively low utilization rate, combined with a younger population than in other regions, is also reflected in the lowest per capita expenditures of all NIHB regions: $336 per capita in Nunavut compared to the NIHB average of $483 per capita. Average 2012/13 pharmacy expenditures in Nunavut were $718 per client, slightly lower than the NIHB national average of $750 per client. Total NIHB pharmacy expenditures in Nunavut were approximately $10.7 million in 2012/13. These costs increased 157 % between 2003 and 2013 (Table 1) [11].
Territorial funding for the GN Pharmacy Program is through territorial budget allocation and supplemental funding as required. The Territorial Pharmacy Program focuses primarily on the acquisition and distribution of pharmaceuticals to all territorial health facilities; however, it also funds vaccines, blood services, contracted services and travel and transportation costs for leave replacement positions [13]. Vaccines in the territory comprise 48 % of total drug costs due to the high population growth rates (most vaccines are administered to children), and the availability of Synagis® (Palivizumab), a vaccine given to high risk infants to prevent Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) infections. Synagis® comprises 45 % of total vaccine expenditures or 21.6 % of total pharmaceutical expenditures [13]. Total GN pharmacy expenditures in 2012/13 were approximately $2.8 million. These costs increased by 7.7 % between 2010 and 2013 (Table 1). Similarly, NIHB costs increased by 2.8 % during the same time period.
The overlay of social and economic marginalization with no-charge pharmaceuticals creates a landscape of both advantages and challenges requiring creative and adaptive policies and procedures for pharmaceutical service delivery. Ultimately, this landscape provides an important opportunity to provide pharmaceuticals where they otherwise might not be accessible, and to supplement health care services to improve health outcomes for the people of Nunavut.
Pharmaceutical policy development
The mandate of policy is to regulate and govern the set of principles that guide decision making however, responsive health policy development is best facilitated through the routine input from front line service users and stakeholders [14]. Crucial information on the successes and shortcomings of policy application, or how it works in real life, must be available for adaptive and responsive policy development. There is an absence of published academic or governmental research regarding pharmaceutical practice in Nunavut despite considerable federal and territorial expenditures on pharmaceuticals and their importance with respect to health care delivery. Pharmaceutical health care for the people of Nunavut (referred to as Nunavummiut) is influenced by distinct Canadian federal and Nunavut territorial payment responsibilities for pharmaceuticals, as well as challenges in service provision to remote Arctic communities that are often affected by staffing shortages and isolation due to weather-related access issues. These factors introduce tensions into the acquisition, management and distribution processes which ultimately impact health care decisions. This research combines document analysis and interviews with patients, health care providers and policy makers in several communities in Nunavut to consider the research question of how existing pharmaceutical administration and distribution policies and practices in Nunavut impact patient care.
Methods
This grounded theory community-based research and fieldwork was conducted between 2012 and 2014. The GN and community of Arviat invited research on pharmaceuticals due to concerns within the territory and specifically within the community as to policies and practices affecting patient care. Research planning and fieldwork was guided through consultation and assistance with the Qaujigiartiit Health Research Centre in Arviat and research associates who were long-term residents of Arviat. The topics and questions on the interview guide originated from community consultation during fieldwork in 2013 which were then edited and approved by the community prior to submission and further review by the Nunavut Research Institute for licensing approval. The diverse interests and concerns evident within the community and territory suggested that exploration of several issues was required. Therefore, this research follows a grounded theory framework and was designed so as to allow for the development of themes to emerge from the research itself [15].
Research methods include document analysis and semi-structured interviews. Document analysis includes review of federal and territorial policy documents and financial reports. Interviews were conducted in May 2014 with 35 participants in total, including residents/patients and health care providers from Arviat, health care providers and administrators from the Regional Health Centre and Qikiqtani General Hospital in Rankin Inlet and Iqaluit, and key policy makers in Iqaluit and Ottawa. Participants included CHC administrators, physicians, front counter staff, translators, CHNs working in various health care facilities, pharmacists and pharmacy technicians, community health representatives, and members of the Nunavut Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee. Some participants provided interview responses based on multiple roles (e.g. as both health care providers and community residents). Participants were recruited for interviews through several methods including convenience sampling through information posted in several public locations in Arviat, local radio promotion inviting participation, snowball sampling, and purposive sampling for key informants. Interviews were conducted in private rooms, lasted a minimum of one hour in length and were audio recorded and transcribed for analysis. Research protocols received institutional approval through the University of Toronto’s Office of Research Ethics (Protocol # 28248) and were licensed through the Nunavut Research Institute (License # 01 033 13 N-M).
This research was designed to explore how existing pharmaceutical administration and distribution policies and practices impact patient care. In consideration of these research goals, interviews included open-ended questions regarding participants’ personal and professional (if applicable) experiences with pharmacy services (e.g. “Tell me about your experiences with medications”). Interview guides were developed with community, territorial and institutional assistance and questions were tailored for specific interview participant roles. For example, health providers were asked about the administration of their daily work while community members were asked about their personal experiences with medication acquisition and availability. Special care was taken to ensure language was appropriate to participant roles and simplified to reflect common language terms. Specifically, patient informed consent forms and questions were developed with institutional guidance from departmental researchers in populations with similar considerations of low educational and literacy levels; in Nunavut this can occur in both English and Inuktitut. Among Aboriginal adults in Nunavut, only 55 % have completed education above an elementary level [3]. Interview materials were translated into Inuktitut and participants were offered either English or Inuktitut documentation. Interpreters were made available on request for interviews. None of the participants elected for the use of an interpreter, and few selected the Inuktitut documentation. Verification and clarification was sought through iterative questioning until internally consistent understandings were observed. For example, distribution was explored throughout the supply chain and patient-provider encounters were verified from multiple informants on both sides of those transactions whenever possible.
QSR-NVIVO v10.2 [16] software was used to code and analyze data. The coding strategy developed for data analysis included using nodes to identify themes within the data and attributes to identify demographic information (i.e. ethnicity, role and community affiliation) from participants. The conceptual framework was informed by open coding, with emergent tree nodes outlining broad themes and child nodes allowing for more in-depth interrogation of the data. Queries on key words and themes were used to analyze the data and saturation was established when supporting evidence for findings was collected and found to be consistent from all participants within similar roles or with similar attributes.
Results
Several key issues are consistently discussed among research participants and supported by document analysis. These issues involve: 1) the distinct NIHB and GN financial responsibilities for pharmaceuticals and their impact on health provider decisions for medication sourcing; 2) the resource requirements from CHCs to distribute retail pharmacy prescriptions through CHCs; and, 3) the financial losses and challenges associated with the return and disposal of unclaimed and expired medications.
NIHB and GN financial responsibilities and medication sourcing
In theory, Inuk residents of Nunavut should be beneficiaries of some of the most complete medical coverage in Canada. While 10 % of Canadians report cost-related non-adherence to prescription medications [17], and 14 to 39 % (depending on province) of Canadians are uninsured for prescription medications [18], all beneficiaries of the Non-Insured Health Benefits program receive coverage for most prescription medications and many OTC medications such as antihistamines and acetaminophen [9]. In practice however, both the NIHB and the GN have been the subject of serious criticism stemming from federal audits of their administration and accountability for their respective programming, including pharmaceutical health care. The NIHB program has been criticized for serious oversights in monitoring of drug utilization and poor management and control of program expenditures, in particular the management of pharmacy benefits [19]. The GN has similarly been notified of serious concerns in regards to its financial management practices, lack of budget planning and consistent overspending, although notably, these issues were primarily attributed to the significant number of staffing vacancies and recognized difficulties in recruiting and retaining employees in the territory [20]. An example of the repercussions of the lack of GN financial management was the termination of a business relationship between the GN and a specialized pharmaceutical supplier due to vendor dissatisfaction. Both the NIHB and GN have recognized fiscal management issues that impact policy control and accountability, however lack of oversight may also hinder the examination of procedural discrepancies that are occurring in health care settings. These management issues affect administration and delivery of services throughout the territory and have the potential to impact patient care.
Policy
Prescribing policies dictate that pharmaceuticals that do not meet the criteria for inpatient medications (including OTC) are to be prescribed and acquired through retail pharmacies. Remote communities often do not have full time health care providers with prescribing privileges such as nurse practitioners (NPs) and physicians in the community. Compared with Canadians overall, Aboriginal inhabitants in the territories are significantly less likely to have had contact with a General Practitioner or any other medical doctor in the past 12 months (58.8 % versus 78.7 %), and are significantly more likely to have had contact with a nurse than the average Canadian (49.0 % versus 9.8 %, respectively) [21]. Given that the majority of care in remote communities is delivered by nurses, Nunavut’s extended scope of practice allows CHNs and midwives to dispense many medications from wardstock [22]. In situations when a class of medication is unable to be dispensed by a CHN, prescriptions can only be obtained by communicating with the remote doctor on call.
Practice
Divided federal and territorial financial responsibilities for pharmaceuticals create considerable tensions within the system between the NIHB and the GN. Health provider research participants discussed many factors influencing their decisions regarding medication sourcing (NIHB prescription or GN wardstock) including: pressures to shift expenses to maximize NIHB benefits, availability of a retail pharmacy in the community, weather, access to a prescribing health provider and staffing shortages.
Within CHCs, health providers are actively encouraged to minimize use of wardstock and maximize the use of NIHB benefits by writing prescriptions from retail pharmacies. One informant, a health provider in a community with a retail pharmacy, discussed a patient who had attended the CHC during regular business hours and was in need of a prescribed medication that was available in the CHC dispensary.
“We have bottles of wardstock and the CHNs are allowed to dispense…[but] we would give them a prescription to go to the pharmacy…[administration] does not want us to [give the patient even a starter dose] because of budget…five years ago, they’d have gotten their meds from here”.
In remote communities without retail pharmacies, weather delays and retail pharmacy dispensing times can delay pharmacy deliveries by anywhere from two to ten days. These delays in many cases would significantly impact patient care, and for this reason more medications are dispensed directly from wardstock and fewer prescriptions are written from retail pharmacies that would be expensed to the NIHB.
When a health care provider with prescribing privileges is unavailable within the community, CHNs are more likely to dispense a full course of medicine than to attempt to contact a prescriber outside the community for authorization, or to wait until a prescriber is available in person. Even in situations when a prescriber is within the community, it has been noted that understaffing (a common issue in the north) and/or high patient loads can cause CHNs to dispense medications from wardstock rather than seek out providers for prescription authorizations. A health care provider interviewed, referring to the GN’s Formulary Drug Treatment Codes categorizing medications which can be only initiated by a physician as “code B” medications, indicated that these are referred to by staff as “B is for Bother the Doctor”, while “code D” medications for which one dose may be dispensed by a CHN are referred to as “D is for Do It Yourself”. Health providers in remote locations are necessarily called upon to practice more independently and medication sourcing is but one of these areas of practice.
Distribution of retail pharmacy prescriptions through community health centres
In the majority of Nunavut communities, primary care is delivery by nurses with physicians only visiting sporadically based on rotating schedules and weather-related accessibility. Staff turnover for remote nursing is recognized as a serious challenge, with vacancy rates between 37 and 57 % across the regions in Nunavut [23]. These nursing shortages have been noted to result in an increased reliance on casual nursing staff with decreased familiarity with Inuit culture, a shift from primary health care to more emergent acute and chronic care, and increased stress levels on nurses leading to decreased job satisfaction, and burnout [23, 24]. Nurses practicing under an extended scope of practice take on duties that southern nurses in more urban centres are not asked to perform, with routine staffing shortages further exacerbating the situation. Health care informants indicate that they are often called upon to take on increasing levels of administrative work, such as the distribution of retail pharmacy prescriptions, which take time away from patient care.
Policy
In communities without retail pharmacies, many of the administrative roles of pharmacists (i.e. stocking, distribution of medications to patients and patient counselling), are performed by CHCs. When medications from retail pharmacies arrive at the CHC, staff are required to verify shipping records and then provide a list to administrative staff for patient notification. Front counter staff then make attempts to contact the patient (generally by phone) to inform them that their medication has arrived. Unpacked medications are to be shelved in an organized manner (alphabetically by packaging type) in the CHC dispensary to await patient pickup.
Many chronic medications are prescribed with automatic refills, indicating that retail pharmacies send out one month supplies of medication at regular intervals without further instruction required until the prescription expires. There is currently no system in place to inform the retail pharmacy if the current prescription has been picked up, therefore pharmacists proceed with the assumption that the next month’s supply of medication is required, even if a previously unclaimed prescription is still shelved in the CHC dispensary.
Practice
When understaffing and high patient loads occur, duties associated with retail pharmacy deliveries may be deprioritized. Many health care provider informants voice displeasure and frustration with the additional administrative burdens of these deliveries, which they see as taking time away from patient care. As one health provider informant stated,
“there’s boxes and boxes and boxes, I’m talking hundreds of prescriptions a week, that are filtering through this Health Centre …if I had to sit every day and figure out people’s phone numbers, most people have no phones, some people are nomadic, they’re moving from house to house, it’s very difficult to track them down to say ‘hey, your medications are here’.”
Community participants speak of not receiving notification that their prescriptions have arrived and visiting the CHC several times to make enquiries, sometimes to discover that their medications had arrived a week or more earlier. As two patient informants voiced,
“we’ve had prescriptions sit at the Health Centre, for a week or two, longer than they should, and we were waiting…so they’re in the community, and they haven’t called us. They’ll say ‘this came in last week; we didn’t know you were waiting for it’.”
Many health care provider participants note that there are a large number of patients who never retrieve these medications. While lack of awareness among patients that their medications have arrived is one possible explanation, health provider informants suggested several other possibilities including: lack of understanding for the rationale for the medication, denial of their medical diagnosis or the severity of potential outcomes of non-adherence and distrust of medications. As the vast majority of Nunavummiut speak Inuktitut as their first language and few health care providers are fluent, language challenges may also contribute to misunderstandings [25]. Family pressure can also impact adherence, for example a health care provider informant described an incident when they asked a patient diagnosed with severe depression if they were taking their medications, and they responded,
“my grandmother said that I am not mentally ill and ‘you’re not taking that medicine’.”
Informants suggest another possible factor might be the lack of understanding among many Inuit as to the high cost of medications. Inuit are life-long recipients of pharmaceuticals provided with no patient co-pay, including such OTC medications as acetaminophen and ibuprofen. Even for most medications received from retail pharmacies, there is no cash value printed on the receipt. Informants suggested that an understanding of the financial value of the medications that are being prescribed might influence adherence by Inuit patients. As one health provider informant, with over 7 years of service in Nunavut discussed,
“with the HPV vaccine, we were having really low impact and one of the conversations that I started to have was ‘do you realize that people have to pay for it and that and [we] are now offering it for free?’ , and then people were kind of like ‘oh’, like it kinda got their attention. Not that it’s going to keep your daughter from having cancer…but when it’s free! [referring to medication]…maybe if they don’t see the value in it, they don’t bother or they throw it away or something like that”.
Through what is likely a combination of these factors, virtually all participants consistently note that many retail pharmacy medications are not getting to, or being used by, the intended patient.
Unclaimed medications were observed in the CHC dispensary in overflowing boxes and shelving units (Figs. 1, 2 and 3). Several patients were observed to have multiple prescriptions dating back three of four months. Many health providers voice frustration with this issue and the economic wastage incurred. As one health care provider informant explained,
“The problem is, when a physician writes a prescription, commonly three, four, six refills may go on that prescription…sometimes we get a backlog…the other day I noticed that we had a four month supply of a medication for a child who I knew was no longer even in the community. This is a problem, it is a wastage of medication, medications are having to be destroyed, at least once a month there is a box full of medications, for various reasons…hundreds of thousands of dollars worth in loss…I calculated there not too long ago that one certain load of medication came in from a household and there was nothing short of about 12 to 15 thousand dollars worth of medication. This is a problem.”
Although there is some confusion as to where this notification chain breaks down, the effects of this disorganization can negatively impact patient care through loss of trust in the CHC, as two community informants indicated:
I1: in the bubble packs…a lot of people who have chronic illness have bubble packs, right? They are trying a new medication, or they’re bumping up a milligram, they’ll be on it for a long time and not understand why when ‘the doctor said I should be off it by now and I’m still on it’
SR: So the doctor is saying “we’re going to discontinue on this”?
I1: oh, yeah
SR: but the next blister pack that arrives…
I1: yes
SR:still has the pills in it?
I1: yep
SR: Now what does the person do? Just takes it?
I1: usually
SR: just assumes, “oh, I guess I misunderstood?”
I1: yep
I2: or they start to mistrust the Health Centre and they stop taking all their pills all together
I1: oh, yeah - that’s a big one
Many health providers voice the most frustration with the lack of an effective mechanism to stop retail pharmacies from filling repeat prescriptions when the patient has not yet picked up the previous prescription. This is stated to be the greatest source of multiple unclaimed prescriptions for the same individual being stored in the dispensary. Several practices have been used to minimize repeat unclaimed prescriptions, although none are implemented broadly across the territory or with proven results. One health provider informant indicates that they now issue repeat prescriptions with a written notation of “as requested by patient”, to necessitate a patient initiated refill. One CHC in the Kivalliq provides a phone at the front desk to actively encourage patient calls to the pharmacy at the time of pick-up so that the patient can request their next month’s prescription be filled. A key pharmacy informant mentions a corresponding increase in patient calls from this community without solicitation, although the informant is unaware as to the reason why this community had noticeably more calls than others. One health provider informant is familiar with a double label system used in other jurisdictions (e.g. Labrador), whereby the retail pharmacy prints two labels for each retail pharmacy prescription and when patients pick-up their medications, one label is removed, affixed to a reorder sheet and faxed back to the pharmacist to inform them that the patient has received the medication and they are authorized to refill the following month’s prescription. While some health provider informants are enthusiastic about these various interventions, others voice concerns about the labour intensive administrative process and increasing responsibility for medication management on the part of CHC staff.
The substantial and sustained requirements of the already taxed CHCs and CHNs to organize, store and distribute retail pharmacy medications likely contributes to the large quantity of unclaimed medications which are indicative of patient non-adherence and suboptimal pharmacotherapy.
Return and disposal of unclaimed and expired medications
Improper pharmaceutical waste management can have significant health, criminal and environmental impacts. In relation to health and safety, most medications are still considered safe beyond their expiration dates, however some (e.g. nitroglycerin, insulin, liquid antibiotics, epinephrine pens) lose efficacy and given the emergent need for these drugs during life threatening situations, potency is mandatory [26]. Criminally, recreational misuse of illegally obtained pharmaceuticals, often from family medicine cabinets or friends, is a growing trend in Canada resulting in increases in theft and fraud as well as health impacts such as overdose deaths, suicides and emergency care costs [27, 28]. Environmentally, pharmacologically active substances have been detected in surface and ground water at levels rivalling some pesticides [29]. This is especially problematic given the environmental sensitivity of arctic ecosystems and the heavy reliance on subsistence hunting of both land and sea mammals.
Policy
Some medications purchased for wardstock by the GN may expire prior to dispensing in the CHCs. As part of regularly scheduled inventory within CHC dispensaries, wardstock is to be shelved in consideration of expiration dates (i.e. newer stock at the back) and any expired medications are to be removed to ensure patient safety. Some expired medications may also be eligible for reimbursements from manufacturers or distributors. According to a key pharmacy informant, some injectable or intravenous drugs may be eligible for reimbursements of as much as $2,700 for a single expired dose.
Expired wardstock medications that are ineligible for reimbursement and unclaimed retail pharmacy medications require environmentally safe disposal and may also be subject to control protocols (e.g. narcotics). The proper disposal of pharmaceuticals in Nunavut is governed by the GN Narcotic and Controlled Drugs Policy (revised edition released Fall 2014) which regulates the “acquisition, storage, prescribing, administration, record keeping and disposal of narcotic and controlled drugs” as well as the responsibilities of authorized health care providers who work with these substances, and by the federal Controlled Drugs and Substances Act [30]. Controlled substances entering the community are closely monitored with pill counts, sealed shipping envelopes and double signatures. However, if these medications are unclaimed or expired, only GN wardstock narcotic and controlled substances are subject to the same procedures in reverse when leaving the community; retail pharmacy medications are subject only to routine disposal. Unclaimed retail pharmacy medications and expired wardstock are sent to Regional Health Centres for incineration or (less frequently) to retail pharmacies for waste management.
Unclaimed retail pharmacy medications that are not picked up may also be eligible for reversal of NIHB expenses through a procedure to reabsorb costs while continuing to remunerate pharmacists for their dispensing fees. Retail pharmacies have varied requirements for accepting these returns. One key pharmacy informant indicates that these reversals are only possible for unclaimed medications that would have been dispensed directly from the retail pharmacies (i.e. to in-town clients) as they are able to confirm the environmental conditions of medication storage, as well as ensure that the medication has been kept in a secure location and has not been subject to tampering. Unclaimed medication reversals are not accepted by some retail pharmacies when medications are dispensed for use in remote communities. Yet another key pharmacy informant indicates that the supply chain from pharmacy to CHC and back was sufficiently controlled to allow for a reversal, as it was secure enough for narcotic and controlled substances protocols. When unclaimed retail pharmacy medications are unable to be returned to retail pharmacies, CHCs are instructed to send them to Regional Health Centres with expired GN wardstock for incineration.
Practice
In speaking to many community member participants about what they do with their personal unused medications, most indicate that they throw them in the garbage. In recognition of this issue and as confirmation of its significance, one health worker informant describes a door-to-door “spring clean up” program that was organized for collecting household medications; this initiative collects several large garbage bags annually requiring the use of a pickup truck due to weight. These findings indicate that there are likely large quantities of unused medications in community homes that would benefit from assisted disposal programs.
Within the dispensary at the CHC, large boxes of unclaimed medications require frequent disposal services. Participants provide varied and ambiguous responses to enquiries regarding this process, alternatively indicating that medications are shipped in sealed cardboard boxes or that they are deposited individually into medical sharps containers and sealed before shipment (Fig. 3). This latter process requires the time consuming process of removing individual medications from the many unclaimed blister packs. Many interview participants describe the time consuming and necessarily deprioritized efforts to routinely return the large quantities of medications for destruction. Time lapses between shipments are estimated to be between one and three months in duration, depending on staffing and storage capacity.
Several interview participants at both the provider and administrative levels discuss the practice of the transfer of retail pharmacy medications into wardstock inventory. Participants explain this practice as being done through either front-end or back-end restocking. If a CHC dispensary does not have stock of a medication that is needed immediately and one is available in the storage units holding retail pharmacy medications that have not yet been picked up, they might dispense the retail pharmacy medication to the patient in immediate need. One patient informant described their experience,
“we’ve gotten something out of the dispensary and it will have somebody else’s label already on it from [retail pharmacy name]…so they’ve taken a labeled drug from [retail pharmacy name] and put them in the dispensary and relabeled it to give it to us.”
This front-end substitution may leave the patient for whom the medication was specifically intended without the medication, but informants note that either the medication is replaced with GN wardstock when it arrives or that more frequently, the medication is taken from the extensive supply of unclaimed retail pharmacy medications that would eventually need to be incinerated. This practice is stated to be extensive enough as to reduce budgetary requirements for CHC inventory. As one health administrator informant states,
“If I had twenty patients that I was getting prescriptions in monthly that they never pick up, and I put them in my stock, and use them to dispense, I’m at zero budget…I’ve been in communities where they are doing it”.
An alternative form of this medication substitution is the replacement of medications already dispensed from wardstock with retail pharmacy medications. This back-end substitution is used when a medication is dispensed from wardstock that might otherwise be prescribed from a retail pharmacist, but that due to timely need (e.g. impending weather) is dispensed directly from the CHC. The prescription for the patient is then sent to the retail pharmacy and when the medication arrives, it is used to replace the GN wardstock that has already been previously dispensed. Although these practices have significant budgetary and possibly legal implications, the health provider informants interviewed are most concerned with patient-centred care and are focusing on the urgency to fill an immediate patient need for medications that could take days or weeks to arrive.
Practices at this time do not track or inventory the destruction medications, including retail pharmacy controlled substances such as narcotics. This lack of oversight could foreseeably result in the unlawful removal of controlled substances by unauthorized individuals. Health provider informants at several levels are concerned that although unclaimed retail pharmacy narcotics are kept in a secure, separate location from other non-controlled medications in the CHC dispensary, that there are few procedures in place to ensure the unclaimed narcotics are destroyed lawfully and appropriately. While the protocol for the destruction of expired GN wardstock controlled substances is compliant with the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, several key informants indicate that there is considerable concern and debate among stakeholders as to the legal and financial responsibility for the disposal of retail pharmacy narcotic and controlled substances. At the centre of the controversy is confusion about ownership and authority over a prescribed medication intended for an individual who has never taken possession. However, the lack of current oversight in regards to their destruction presents a significant risk for the “disappearance” (i.e. unlawful removal) of these medications. These issues are currently under consideration by the GN Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee in consultation with the NIHB and legal counsel to ensure the development of a policy to address this issue.
Discussion
A number of key themes emerge from the interviews conducted for this research: 1) the tensions between NIHB and GN financial responsibilities influence the decisions of health providers and may affect patient care, 2) significant human resources are utilized in Community Health Centres to perform distribution duties associated with retail pharmacy medications; 3) large quantities of unclaimed prescription medications are suggestive of significant financial losses, suboptimal patient care and lower adherence rates; and, 4) the absence of a clear policy and oversight of some controlled substances, such as narcotics, leaves communities at risk for potential illegal procurement or abuse.
Theme one: NIHB versus GN financial responsibilities for pharmaceuticals
As the NIHB is a federally administered program responsible for multiple jurisdictions, Nunavut may be subject to less direct review of expenditures compared to other jurisdictions due to its low pharmacy utilization rates, lowest per capita expenditures and lowest overall pharmaceutical costs. These low figures, combined with past claims of program mismanagement and lack of oversight may be contributing factors in some of the practices identified by research participants leading to unnecessary repeat prescriptions and unclaimed medications. Concurrently, due to the GN’s recognized staffing issues and financial mismanagement in the Department of Health and Social Services, concern regarding the oversight of pharmaceutical expenses may be reasonable.
As CHC administrators are evaluated on their ability to balance their budgets inclusive of wardstock pharmaceutical costs, this may contribute to the practice of inventory transfer from NIHB medications to GN wardstock when retail pharmacy medications are available and unclaimed. Additionally, frustration with the losses associated with quality medications going unclaimed and heading for incineration, and/or with insufficient inventory levels to reflect isolated communities may influence health provider decisions to use retail pharmacy medications for CHC patient care. Systemic policy modifications might reduce the necessity to transfer stock from the NIHB to the GN through increased efficiency in inventory management systems.
Decision making for front line health providers is complex and often involves many considerations that are beyond merely following policy guidelines. Ultimately what is most prominent in interviews is decision making that is patient-centred above other considerations. However, increased situational pressures (such as isolation and staffing shortages) on CHNs to independently dispense medications from GN wardstock may reduce pharmacy industry recommended independent double-checks and increase the potential for dispensing errors. Policy development that recognizes the complexity of the medication sourcing decision-making process may support health providers in their focus on patient care.
Theme two: Pharmacy duties of Community Health Centres
Research participants working in CHCs repeatedly voice frustration and displeasure for the duties and responsibilities associated with the distribution of retail pharmacy medications. Many felt that the role and associated tasks of a pharmacist were being forced on the CHC when understaffing was a common concern. Their inability to perform the time consuming task of notifying patients that their medications were available for pickup is a source of irritation and frustration. Informants recognize that patient non-adherence is likely impacted by an inability for patients to pick up their medications, but also impeded by staffing capacity to notify patients and organize and distribute medications. None of the participants suggest that they are “above” the task, but identify it as an impediment to seeing patients and their many other duties.
Many patient participants also voice frustration with the deprioritized notification of medication arrivals or loss of their medications due to the challenges of storing and organizing large volumes of patient-specific medications in the CHC dispensary. Several interview participants in Arviat strongly suggest that a retail pharmacy is needed in the community and that the population size (~3000) supports the investment, identifying that it would release the CHC from its current responsibilities for the distribution of prescriptions. Overwhelmingly, all interview participants – health providers and patients - are dissatisfied with the current distribution system within CHCs for prescriptions arriving from retail pharmacies outside of the community. This issue affects the majority of communities in Nunavut, as only three of the twenty-five communities currently have retail pharmacies. Not all communities have population sizes that would support a retail pharmacy, however many health care informants express interest in exploring other options, such as the inclusion of a pharmacy technician on staff at CHCs to take on a distinctly tailored role including specific administration, inventory and distribution duties.
Theme three: Losses associated with unclaimed prescriptions
The administrative challenges of CHC distribution practices are likely reflected in the large number of unclaimed prescriptions. Unclaimed medications result in significant loss of human resource capacity through repeat attempts to contact patients, time taken to package up and return medications for disposal, return shipping costs and incineration. These unclaimed medications also signify substantial financial losses as NIHB funded medications are not being used for patient care.
Retail pharmacy policy that is unreceptive to the return and NIHB expense reversal of unclaimed medications may reflect safety concerns, but there is also minimal financial motivation to reabsorb stock or to rapidly respond to prescription discontinuation requests. While pharmacies that accept the return of unclaimed medications are still entitled to claim a dispensing fee from the NIHB through a special code for this purpose, they are effectively performing two distinct tasks (i.e. dispensing and then reabsorbing medications back into stock) and being reimbursed for only one. Additionally, the pharmacy loses the original sale and may have to consider expiration dates and/or if the returned product is resalable.
Several strategies to minimize automatic prescription repeats are suggested but untested. Further examination into the efficacy of these different approaches might provide sufficient evidence to standardize a method to reduce these losses across the territory. If similar issues of repeat and unclaimed prescriptions are found in other jurisdictions nationally, the savings to the NIHB could be quite substantial.
What is repeated vehemently among many health provider informants is their disbelief that this long term wastage is apparently going unnoticed and that auditing or regulatory bodies have not identified these losses and found a way to minimize their occurrence. This lack of oversight might be better understood in light of the Auditor General’s Report on the NIHB, and Nunavut’s relatively low per capita pharmacy utilization rates, however this area of concern would benefit from further examination. Policy development that recognizes the limited staffing in CHCs and the need for enhanced communication with retail pharmacies may facilitate medication delivery to patients and reduce the financial losses attributed to unclaimed medications.
Theme four: Controlled drugs oversight and potential for illegal procurement
As an associated result of the excessive unclaimed prescriptions, the potential for the illegal procurement of narcotics and controlled substances is highlighted as a potential threat to the community. Health provider informants are genuinely concerned and looking for guidance to minimize this risk. The absence of policy and oversight on this issue presents an opportunity for narcotics to be abused or available for illegal trade. Interviews demonstrated that there is an urgent need for this risk to be mitigated through a clear policy that is compliant with the federal Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. Policy makers are struggling with these issues currently, to minimize the great risks of narcotics that can go unaccounted for with little to no notice. This timely issue poses great risks to communities every day that a clear policy is not available and consistently administered.
Conclusions
This research identifies several areas of concern which may prove beneficial in providing direction for future policy development that best serves the needs of Nunavummiut: 1) NIHB and GN financial responsibilities for pharmaceuticals and their effects on medication sourcing, 2) resource requirements of CHCs to distribute retail pharmacy medications, 3) human resource, patient adherence and financial losses associated with unclaimed medications, and 4) community risks associated with the absence of clear policy for the disposal of controlled substances. The financial, health, safety and efficiency issues identified in this research require consideration through policy development that is familiar with the many challenges of service provision in Nunavut. Demographic factors such as a young and rapidly growing population combined with geographical, sociological and environmental challenges affect the selection and the availability of medications where and when they are required. The tensions created by the competing NIHB and GN financial responsibilities affect everyone from the GN policy writers to the Inuit child in need of an out-of-stock inhaler in a storm-isolated community.
Health providers in remote communities make decisions first and foremost based on patient care, but often these decisions put their actions in direct conflict with policy and procedures that may not be reflective of the realities of stock shortages and dispensing challenges in a small, remote community. Given that providers are most aware of both the needs of quality patient care and the policy restrictions that create challenges in meeting this demand, future policy development should be considered that is reflective of this knowledge and minimizes the need for providers to make decisions that may fall outside of accepted policies and procedures.
Through addressing these identified issues in future policy development, several benefits may be possible: financial savings may be realized through minimizing pharmaceutical wastage, community safety may be improved through the proper administration and disposal of medications including controlled substances, and adherence may increase through consistency, availability and accuracy of medications. Participants in this research, who live and work in Nunavut, have been best suited to identify issues in need of attention, and are also positioned to benefit the most from policy development which addresses their concerns.

Abstract
Background
Killer whales (Orcinus orca) are the most widely distributed cetacean, occurring in all oceans worldwide, and within ocean regions different ecotypes are defined based on prey preferences. Prey items are largely unknown in the eastern Canadian Arctic and therefore we conducted a survey of Inuit Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) to provide information on the feeding ecology of killer whales. We compiled Inuit observations on killer whales and their prey items via 105 semi-directed interviews conducted in 11 eastern Nunavut communities (Kivalliq and Qikiqtaaluk regions) from 2007-2010.
Results
Results detail local knowledge of killer whale prey items, hunting behaviour, prey responses, distribution of predation events, and prey capture techniques. Inuit TEK and published literature agree that killer whales at times eat only certain parts of prey, particularly of large whales, that attacks on large whales entail relatively small groups of killer whales, and that they hunt cooperatively. Inuit observations suggest that there is little prey specialization beyond marine mammals and there are no definitive observations of fish in the diet. Inuit hunters and elders also documented the use of sea ice and shallow water as prey refugia.
Conclusions
By combining TEK and scientific approaches we provide a more holistic view of killer whale predation in the eastern Canadian Arctic relevant to management and policy. Continuing the long-term relationship between scientists and hunters will provide for successful knowledge integration and has resulted in considerable improvement in understanding of killer whale ecology relevant to management of prey species. Combining scientists and Inuit knowledge will assist in northerners adapting to the restructuring of the Arctic marine ecosystem associated with warming and loss of sea ice.
Background
In recent years there has been significant interest in the role of killer whale (Orcinus orca) predation in shaping marine ecosystems and regulating prey populations [1]. Killer whales are widespread in world oceans and are the top predator in all regions where they occur [2–4]. The species consumes a wide variety of prey items, ranging from small schooling fish to large baleen whales [5], and there has been considerable debate over the role of killer whale predation in trophic cascades and prey species dynamics [6–8]. Killer whale predation can limit small prey populations [9–11], but more information on the species and number of prey consumed is needed to better address this issue [12]. Researchers have determined that in many areas killer whales with different and largely non-overlapping foraging specializations can co-exist. Examples include the coastal temperate northeast Pacific, where the transient ecotype feeds primarily if not exclusively on marine mammals, and the resident ecotype eats fish [13, 14]. Four to five different ecotypes with different prey preferences have been identified in Antarctic waters [15–17]. Similar patterns have been identified for the northeast Atlantic [18], and to some extent for the eastern Tropical Pacific and southern Indian Oceans [19].
In most other regions of the world, little is known about the ecology, life-history, and population status of killer whales [4]. One of these areas is the eastern Canadian Arctic (Figure 1), where there has been little directed research on killer whales until recently [20, 21]. Killer whales were historically present in Davis Strait and Baffin Bay during the ice-free season, where they were occasionally reported in whaling logbooks in the 1800s [22]. The species appears to have recently colonized the Hudson Bay region [12], where sightings are increasing, possibly in response to declining summer sea ice distribution [23]. Killer whales are seasonal visitors to high latitude regions and sightings peak during the summer months (August and September) [24]. They have been observed killing and consuming other marine mammals, including both cetaceans (beluga (Delphinapterus leucas), narwhal (Monodon monoceros), bowhead (Balaena mysticetus)) and phocid seals (e.g., ringed (Pusa hispida) and bearded (Erignathus barbatus) seals [12, 22, 24, 25]). These species are important to Inuit cultural and socio-economic well-being, and local hunters have expressed concern over increasing predation pressure on narwhal, beluga, and other Arctic marine mammals [12, 26–28].
Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) is being increasingly used in Nunavut [29–32], providing a long temporal record of rare species. Both Inuit and research observations of killer whale hunting and feeding can be scarce and hunting behaviour cryptic and hard to interpret. Observations of predation are rarely acquired by scientists, but Inuit hunters spend significant amounts of time on these waters hunting, fishing, boating, and observing marine mammals. We interviewed Inuit hunters and elders in Nunavut to develop an extensive baseline knowledge of Arctic killer whales. We collected information via 105 semi-directed interviews [33, 34], including questions on killer whale prey items, hunting techniques, prey avoidance behaviour, and consumption patterns. Interviewees also provided information on killer whale abundance, distribution, and movements, which is summarized elsewhere [12, 24].
Methods
We used semi-directed interviews with Inuit hunters to document spatial and textual information on killer whales and their prey. This method provides a way to collect TEK in an open and flexible manner and avoids the rigidity of questionnaires [33, 34]. A list of questions was developed in advance (Appendix 1), based on knowledge gaps of killer whale information (e.g., prey items, hunting behaviour), but interviews remained open-ended and each interviewee was given the option to elaborate on matters that were important to them. Interviewees do not always address every topic, but the approach also allows the interviewee to provide important information not anticipated by the researcher. Note that quotes are usually via the interpreter and not a direct quotation from the interviewee although some were in English. The research protocol was approved by the Office of Research Services, University of Manitoba (i.e., ethics approval) and the Nunavut Research Institute (NRI), and interviews were conducted with the consent and assistance of local Hunters and Trappers Organizations/Associations (HTO/HTA) in each community.
Communities (Table 1 Figure 1) were chosen to provide a wide representation throughout the Hudson Bay and Baffin Island regions of Nunavut and with consideration of historic and recent killer whale observations [24, 27] and logistical constraints. Interviews were conducted with the aid of a local interpreter, with most conducted in Inuktitut (some in English). Spatial information (hunting and traveling locations, outpost camps, killer whale sightings, migration routes, etc.) was recorded on maps copied from the Nunavut Land Use Study [35]. Interviewees were identified using a reputational sampling method [36] where the local HTO in each community provided a list of potential interviewees, augmented with other participants identified by the interpreters or other interviewees (i.e., snowball technique [37]). Our research protocol allowed participants to remain anonymous or have their names acknowledged as a source of information, but stipulated that their names not be attached to any specific comments. All participants, that chose to be acknowledged, are listed in Appendix 2.
A mix of qualitative and quantitative survey data on killer whales was collected and analyzed. Here we focus on the predation information only, without any specific focus on the information related to abundance, group sizes, spatiotemporal distribution, migrations and movements, etc. (data on file), although we give brief mention of these subjects where appropriate. Qualitative data were analyzed using an interpretive approach to connect ideas and categorize results [38], where results are grouped into related categories (e.g., specific prey items) and patterns summarized. Results were summarized within and between communities and four different regions (Table 1), and across Nunavut as a whole. All individual sighting reports were added to a larger killer whale sightings database [27], and observations from nine communities (pre-2010 interviews) were included in a recent analysis of the database, including predation observations [24] (also see [11, 12] regarding communities in the Hudson Bay region).
Results
We conducted 105 semi-directed interviews in 11 Nunavut communities between July 2007 and March 2010 (Table 1, Figure 1) (5-17 interviews per community: mean 9.5). Most interviewees were male (91%, one female interviewee in Arctic Bay, Arviat, and Rankin Inlet, two in Hall Beach, Pangnirtung, and Pond Inlet). We made an effort to interview older hunters, and 71 of 89 interviewees who provided age information were born in the 1950s or earlier. Younger hunters were interviewed on occasion, but only one interviewee was under 30. Most participants were active hunters or formerly active hunters (full-time harvesters) when they were younger, and most interviewees have spent a considerable amount of time hunting, fishing and boating throughout their lives (data on file). Nearly all participants (97%) had seen killer whales at least once, although not necessarily in the vicinity of their current community. Informants provided information on the seasonal and spatial distribution of killer whales in Nunavut, in addition to information on movements, migrations, and relative abundance. This information is presented in detail elsewhere [24].
Marine mammal prey items
Participants in all communities provided extensive information on killer whale prey items. Inuit throughout Nunavut reported that marine mammals are the main prey items, and that all species of the phocid seals and the most commonly occurring cetaceans are consumed. Most interviewees reported multiple prey items, and five (two in Repulse Bay, three in Igloolik) referred to killer whales as the ""wolves of the sea"", or being ""like wolves"". Killer whales were reported to ""eat whatever they can catch"", ""eat anything"", and similar remarks by 14 interviewees (seven in Foxe Basin, three each in Repulse Bay and south Baffin, and one in north Baffin). Phocid seals (mainly ringed seals, but also harp (Pagophilus groenlandicus), bearded, and hooded (Crystophora cristata) seals, in descending order of frequency) were most commonly reported as prey (73 interviewees, 70% of total), followed by narwhal (63 interviewees, 60%), beluga (55, 52%) and bowhead whales (48, 46%). All communities and regions indicated similar marine mammal prey items, but the proportions of interviewees indicating each species varied by region (Figure 2).
Reports of bowhead whales as a prey item were non-randomly distributed across regions (chi-square test, χ2 = 11.00, df = 3, P = 0.012), and concentrated in Foxe Basin (21 of 23 interviewees, 44% of the total interviewees that reported this species as prey). Bowhead predation was reported in the other three regions, but by fewer interviewees. Reports of narwhal as prey were also non-randomly distributed (χ2 = 11.22, df = 3, P = 0.011) and concentrated in the northern Baffin Island communities, with few south Baffin interviewees reporting this species as prey. Conversely, few north Baffin interviewees reported beluga as prey in comparison to the other three regions (χ2 = 7.63, df = 3, P = 0.055). Narwhal was also commonly reported as prey for the Hudson Bay region, particularly in Repulse Bay (16 of 17 interviewees). Reports of seals as prey items were evenly distributed across all four regions (χ2 = 2.89, df = 3, P = 0.409). One north Baffin interviewee (from Qikiqtarjuaq) also identified minke whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) as killer whale prey. Phocid seals were identified as prey by 73 (70%) interviewees, in all four regions (Figure 2). Most of these (70, 96%) identified ringed seals as a prey item, and this was the most commonly identified seal species in all four regions (Figure 3, ranging from 83% of the 12 Hudson Bay interviewees who listed ""seals"" to 100% of those in Foxe Basin and north Baffin). Harp seals were the second most commonly reported phocid prey, with 22 of the 73 interviewees (30%) identifying this species. Harp seals were identified as killer whale prey in all four regions, particularly in Foxe Basin and the south Baffin communities. Bearded seals were also mostly reported as a prey item by Foxe Basin interviewees (11 of 14 total reports). Hooded seals were reported as killer whale prey by one interviewee in Qikiqtarjuaq.
Predation on fish
There is little evidence that Canadian Arctic killer whales eat fish [24], and interviewee responses suggested that predation on fish, if it does occur, is extremely rare (Table 2). Most interviewees (n = 79, 75%) did not mention or discuss fish as killer whale prey at all. Five interviewees noted that they did not know, or were not sure, if killer whales ate fish, and nine suggested they probably did, or might. Only four interviewees specifically stated that killer whales did not eat fish or that they had never heard of it occurring. Seven interviewees stated that killer whales did eat fish (five from Foxe Basin, two of which were in reference to the Pond Inlet area; and two from southern Baffin Island). However, none of these seven interviewees indicated that they had observed predation on fish first-hand.
Killer whale hunting techniques
Interviewees provided extensive discourse of the hunting behaviour of killer whales, and described the methods used to hunt bowhead, narwhal, beluga, and seals.
Bowhead whales
In total, 35 interviewees provided information on the methods killer whales use to attack and kill bowhead whales, including 17 who described first-hand observations (most from Igloolik, 10). The other 18 interviewees described killer whale attack behaviour from stories they had heard from others (Table 3). Foxe Basin interviewees recounted either direct observations or second-hand stories of 13 different killer whale attacks on bowhead whales (data on file), and provided most of the information on this species as a killer whale prey item. Eight Foxe Basin interviewees estimated the number of bowhead whales killed there each year ranged from 3 to 10. Killer whale attack behaviour is summarized in Table 3. Most interviewees provided similar descriptions of the techniques used when killer whales attack bowhead whales that included: (1) to drown prey by holding the whale underwater and/or covering the blowhole and (2) immobilize the prey prior to suffocation by biting and holding on to the front flippers and tail, ramming the whale to cause internal damage such as breaking ribs, and tearing chunks of flesh out of the living whale. Many interviewees described the cooperative nature of killer whale attacks, such that some whales would be on top of the bowhead, others biting the flippers and tail, while others rammed it. Two interviewees also described observations where several killer whales continued to circle the bowhead, to keep it from escaping, while the others attacked. One interviewee noted that smaller groups of killer whales occur in Foxe Basin, where they concentrate on smaller bowheads; but larger groups of killer whales occur in Arctic Bay where they are able to kill adult bowhead whales. There were 14 bowhead attack observations that included an estimate of killer whale group size, ranging from 1-30 (mean 6.2, median 3.5).
Inuit hunters occasionally found dead bowhead whales that were killed by killer whales, and this was noted by 22 interviewees. Reports were again mostly from Foxe Basin (Table 3), but dead bowhead whales were also reported from Hudson Bay (Repulse Bay) and northern Baffin Island (all three communities). Inuit assumed killer whales were responsible based on the external condition of the carcass (bite marks, chunks removed, evidence of internal injury such as broken ribs). Fifteen Foxe Basin interviewees identified locations of dead bowhead whales that had been killed by killer whales. Foxe Basin hunters reported finding from 3 to 5 dead bowhead whales in a single summer, with higher numbers in some years. A total of 32 observations of dead bowheads were reported for the region (including one in Lyon Inlet), and after correcting for overlapping reports, a minimum of 22 different dead bowheads were documented (with 8 found in 1999; data on file). In many cases, these whales were not eaten, or very little has been consumed (see below). In 1999, one was fresh enough for local Inuit to use as indicated by an interviewee in each of Igloolik and Hall Beach (Table 3).
Narwhal
Attacks on narwhal were observed by 24 interviewees, and four others reported stories they had heard from others. Five Foxe Basin interviewees had observed attacks, although most occurred in other areas (Table 4). Four Hudson Bay interviewees (all Repulse Bay) had observed attacks in their general area. Most observations (13) were reported by interviewees in north Baffin communities. Fourteen interviewees provided descriptive information on the methods used to kill narwhal. Prior to starting the attack, killer whales often herded the narwhal to a suitable location with deep enough water (see below), and also circled the group of whales to keep them stationary. Two interviewees noted that killer whales appear to tire the narwhal out prior to commencing an attack.
Interviewees reported killer whales ramming narwhal to ""break their ribs"", and killer whales will ""play with"" the narwhal, or pieces of them, and throw them around. One interviewee provided a second-hand description of killer whales ""playing soccer"" with the narwhal, and another observed killer whales killing narwhal by slapping them with their tail. Interviewees had observed killer whales biting narwhal, and sometimes carrying a narwhal in their mouth after biting them in the middle of the body. One Pond Inlet interviewee described two killer whales biting a narwhal and pulling it apart, leaving the head and tail behind and taking the ""meat in the middle"". Two interviewees reported that killer whales will also drown narwhal. One Igloolik interviewee described an attack in Admiralty Inlet, where the killer whales herded the narwhal close to shore, and then the smaller killer whales would come close to the shore to grab a narwhal and then head back out into deeper water, where the larger killer whales stayed. Participants in Repulse Bay noted that when they are stalking prey, killer whales will slow down, move very deliberately, and remain as quiet as possible in order to reduce the wake and sound produced by their dorsal fin moving through the water. When they are close to their prey they pick up speed.
Dead narwhals were often found with crushed abdomens and broken ribs, bite marks, and with pieces missing, and this was reported by 17 interviewees (Table 4). Two North Baffin hunters reported collecting maqtaq (skin and blubber) from narwhal that were killed by killer whales. An interviewee from Repulse Bay indicated that killer whales normally do not go after tusked narwhal, and another indicated that narwhal with tusks are never found floating dead. A Pond Inlet interviewee had observed killer whales going after female narwhal, but not males. He recounted a story that tusked narwhal had killed killer whales in the past; the narwhal pierced the killer whale with its tusk, and become stuck, with both animals dying as a result. Tusked narwhal may therefore represent a danger to killer whales; however, a Pangnirtung interviewee stated that they will attack narwhal with and without tusks, and two interviewees had observed killer whales kill tusked narwhal. An Arctic Bay hunter found a dead tusked narwhal covered with killer whale bite marks.
Beluga
Nineteen interviewees discussed killer whale attacks on beluga whales, with most from south Baffin (10, mostly (8) from Pangnirtung) (Table 5). Five interviewees told stories they had heard from others, the others recounted direct observations. Similar to attacks on narwhal, killer whales were reported to circle beluga before attacking, and killer whales have been observed ramming belugas with the presumed intent to cause internal damage that included broken ribs. Participants also reported that killer whales bit belugas in the mid-section, hold them in their mouth, and lift them out of the water, and will also toss them around. Predation events are often accompanied by oil slicks and scraps of blubber, and one interviewee noted gulls swarming around an attack site. A Pangnirtung interviewee told of a story he heard, where in the 1950s a person watched a killer whale eating a beluga that was still alive and moving. Seven interviewees noted that hunters often see beluga scraps (skin and blubber) floating in the water after killer whale attacks, and carcasses were sometimes found. One Pangnirtung interviewee saw a dead beluga after it had been hit and killed, the blubber was missing and the ribs were broken on both sides. Another noted that killer whales would sometimes kill ""hundreds"" of belugas and not eat them all. When the killer whales had left the kill site, Inuit would collect the maqtaq from the numerous dead belugas.
Phocid seals
Twelve interviewees reported observations of attempted or successful predation on seals (ringed, harp and bearded seals), dominated by observations from south Baffin and Foxe Basin (Table 6). Four interviewees also noted second-hand observations and stories of killer whales attacking ringed and harp seals. Two north Baffin interviewees had observed killer whales slapping live ringed seals in the air with their tails, and four interviewees discussed the methods killer whales use to wash seals off small ice floes (reported for ringed and harp seals). Only two interviewees reported finding dead seals: a ringed seal in Foxe Basin (no additional details provided), and a harp seal (Iqaluit interviewee) that was found half eaten, by either a killer whale or a Greenland shark (Somniosus microcephalus).
All four observations of washing seals from ice were from south Baffin communities (two each from Kimmirut and Pangnirtung). Killer whales will circle a piece of ice and use their tails to create waves, washing seals off into the water. Two provided reports based on stories from others, but one hunter in each community provided a first-hand observation. One Kimmirut interviewee noted that killer whales could create enough turbulence to make waves and try to knock seals off, no matter the thickness of the ice floe, and the other described this behaviour as an example of the intelligence killer whales exhibit when hunting.
Prey behaviour in the presence of killer whales, predator avoidance behaviour
When killer whales were present, all the different marine mammal prey species sought refuge in shallow waters close to shore as a predator avoidance technique. This behaviour is well-known among Inuit hunters and is known as 'aarlirijuk' (""fear of killer whales"") in the south Baffin dialect of Inuktitut ([39]; alternate spellings given by [40, 41] are 'ardlingayuq', 'ardlungaijuq' or 'aarlungajut'). The majority of interviewees (68%) reported that prey species will head to shallow waters and to the shoreline to avoid killer whales (with multiple species identified in some cases: 41 for seals, 34 for narwhal, 30 for beluga, and six for bowhead) (Figure 4). The proportion of interviewees identifying this behaviour was similar for the four regions, ranging from 61 to 70% of the total number interviewed. The prey species reported to exhibit this behaviour varied by region and community however, with narwhal observations predominating in North Baffin and Hudson Bay communities (primarily Arctic Bay and Repulse Bay, also Pond Inlet). Observations of seal avoidance behaviour were reported in all communities, and beluga observations were mainly reported by South Baffin interviewees (in all three communities).
Eleven interviewees noted the behaviour bowhead whales use to avoid killer whale predation (three each from Foxe Basin and Hudson Bay, five from north Baffin). Three reported that bowhead whales will ""run away"", and five indicated that they will run to the ice, where killer whales will not go, or into shallow waters, inlets and fjords. One interviewee (Repulse Bay) reported that bowhead whales will dive deep to avoid killer whales, and that they can stay down longer due to their larger lungs. A Rankin Inlet interviewee described a bowhead whale being chased by killer whales, and the bowhead was jumping out of the water. In one Igloolik observation (from August 2007), a killer whale was observed chasing after a bowhead and her calf. At one point during the chase, the entire bowhead calf was up out of the water. The interviewee thought that the cow was underneath holding the calf out of the water to protect it from the killer whale (the final outcome was not known).
Many interviewees had observed narwhal fleeing to shallow waters to avoid killer whales. One interviewee in Pond Inlet described seeing narwhal half-beached (the observation was also described by [42]), and one in Arctic Bay said there were once so many narwhal on shore that people could even touch them. Another Arctic Bay interviewee described a 2008 observation where so many narwhal fled into shallow water that it ""looked liked waves on shore"". A Pond Inlet interviewee reported that in 2008, he heard on the CB radio that killer whales were coming, and people headed to the area to hunt the narwhal that they knew would be gathering. Within 30 minutes the narwhal had gathered in the shallow water close to the shoreline. Killer whales are reported to prefer deep water, and heading to the shoreline is an effective anti-predator technique: an Arctic Bay hunter observed narwhal stay in the shallows long enough for the killer whales to give up and leave, and a Pond Inlet interviewee also observed this in the 1970s in Milne Inlet. Many killer whales came near, and were there for four days, but could not get the narwhal that were hiding in shallow waters and then left.
Three interviewees from Repulse Bay described differences in narwhal surfacing behaviour when killer whales were near. The narwhal will be more quiet than usual, and they stay lower in the water, just barely surfacing to breathe. One noted that narwhal will become aware of killer whales two to three days before they were seen by people. Another observed that narwhal swim faster when followed by killer whales than when hunted by boats. Narwhal will also use alternate travel routes when killer whales were near. One Repulse Bay hunter reported that narwhal would go to Wager Bay to avoid killer whales, although he had not seen this personally. Another hunter had observed narwhal in Wager Bay two years previously (2005), and noted that it was the first time he ever saw narwhal there, despite many trips to the area. Another Repulse Bay hunter indicated that narwhal have become less concentrated in certain predictable areas, and are more scattered in their distribution. Interviewees in Arctic Bay and Pond Inlet also described alternate routes and different staging areas that narwhal will use to avoid killer whales. As noted above, tusked narwhal were also reported to be able to defend themselves by stabbing or piercing an attacking killer whale, although this is likely to result in the death of both animals. An Igloolik interviewee suggested that belugas were arriving later in the season due to the presence of killer whales.
Prey consumption by killer whales
Some participants noted that killer whales will sometimes kill and eat only a little of their prey, leaving the rest, and sometimes even not eat anything at all. This observation varied with prey type, with less eaten of larger prey (i.e., bowhead whales). However, even for the smaller cetaceans, only some parts were eaten as indicated by square maqtaq pieces being observed by Inuit after kills. Many interviewees noted what they termed as wastage by killer whales choosing the choicest parts. Eleven interviewees in four communities (Igloolik, 4; Pond Inlet, 1; Rankin Inlet, 3; Repulse Bay, 3) discussed killer whale wastage of prey (beluga, 4; bowhead, 3; narwhal, 1). Eight interviewees noted that killer whales sometimes ""kill for fun"", kill without eating, or ""play"" with wildlife. Three interviewees described wastage in a positive manner due to Inuit getting maqtaq from killed whales, while five comments were negative towards killer whales because they wasted food. Three interviewees also noted that killer whales appeared to prefer meat to blubber, as floating chunks of skin and blubber were often seen in large square pieces (and sometimes collected for human use).
Discussion
Killer whales dominate marine ecosystems as top predators controlling top-down trophic interactions [6, 43, 44]. Thus, knowledge of food habits and predatory behaviour is key to conservation initiatives. Many Inuit interviewees noted that they did not have much knowledge about killer whales, in comparison to other marine mammals, because they are not hunted (or rarely hunted [27]). Despite these assertions, local Inuit have broad knowledge of killer whales as predators, and their observations represent a substantial addition to our knowledge base on this species in the Canadian Arctic, in terms of their distribution, prey selection and hunting behavior. This is the first dedicated survey of TEK on killer whales in Nunavut waters and both corroborates the results of previous investigators and provides new insights.
Killer whale distribution and prey selection
Direct historical comparisons are difficult given differences in interview techniques and interviewees, but the results suggest an increase in observations of killer whale predation in recent years. Stewart et al. [36] collected TEK in the early 1990s on narwhal and beluga in four communities and solicited information on killer whale predation. Three communities overlap with our study (Arctic Bay, Igloolik and Hall Beach), allowing some comparison of results. Seven hunters from two Foxe Basin communities did not see any attacks on beluga or narwhal, and only one observed scars caused by an unsuccessful attack on beluga. In contrast, five of our 23 Foxe Basin interviewees observed attacks on narwhal (although most occurred in other areas such as Admiralty Inlet, see Table 4) and four saw attacks on beluga. In Arctic Bay Stewart et al. [36] interviewed six hunters for their knowledge of beluga and narwhal. One had seen a killer whale successfully attack a beluga, and another hunter observed scars on a beluga from an unsuccessful attack. One also saw six killer whales attacking a narwhal, and another observed a narwhal killed by a killer whale. Scars from unsuccessful attacks were also reported. In contrast, five of our 11 Arctic Bay interviewees had observed attacks on narwhal [36]), and three of these had also seen dead narwhals that were killed by killer whales. None reported observations of attacks on beluga whales.
Differences in prey species taken by killer whales observed in this study were likely due to non-random distribution of the prey species and/or regional selectivity by particular killer whale groups familiar with different regions. Such regional disparities have been noted by other researchers. Thomsen [45] summarized hunter observations of attacks on belugas and narwhals in West Greenland. In Disko Bay, five of 59 hunters had observed beluga being attacked, compared to four of 14 hunters from the Uummannaq District, one of 34 in the Upernavik District, and none of the 22 hunters interviewed in the Avanersuaq District. For narwhal, none of the 40 Disko Bay hunters or 24 Uummannaq District hunters had seen attacks, and they had been observed by only two of 33 Upernavik District hunters. Attacks were most frequently observed in northwest Greenland, where 15 of 31 Avanersuaq District hunters had seen them. These results, combined with ours, indicate that the north Baffin region of Nunavut (Arctic Bay, but also Pond Inlet) and northeast Baffin region of west Greenland are key locations with concentrated interactions between narwhal and killer whales. In addition to the north Baffin region, the Repulse Bay area was also a key killer whale-narwhal interaction area where four of 17 hunters observed attacks and seven had found dead whales.
Our TEK results support the expectation that killer whales eat multiple prey species, but appear to restrict their hunting to marine mammals in the selected study region. TEK results also suggests that killer whales in eastern Canadian Arctic waters do not feed on walrus, which contrasts with what is known about killer whale feeding habits in Arctic waters north of the Pacific Ocean [46, 47].
Killer whales are apex predators with high energy requirements that can result in conflicts with human interests due to competition with commercial fisheries and interactions with endangered species. Therefore, there is a need to understand killer whale ecology, distribution, abundance, and evolutionary history to inform management and conservation. Interviewees in Foxe Basin (also see [39, 48]) noted a link between a growing bowhead population and increasing killer whale presence. In the eastern Canadian Arctic most cetacean and phocid populations have increased since large-scale commercial whaling and sealing ended in the early to mid-1900s, and improved foraging conditions therefore exist for killer whales. Ferguson et al. [11] tested alternative predator-prey relationships within the Hudson Bay geographic region, where evidence suggested killer whales seasonally concentrate feeding activities on the large-bodied bowhead whale. Results indicated that killer whales feed on narwhal and beluga whales early and late in the ice-free season whereas feeding was focused on bowhead whales during summer. Using TEK estimates of prey mortality, Ferguson et al. [11] estimated that on average 57 bowhead (range 28-90), 112 narwhal (range 10-234), 174 beluga (range 12-326), and 117 seals (range 12-322) are likely removed annually from the region by killer whales. Thus, Inuit TEK can provide information necessary for modeling predation impact and thereby inform management and conservation decisions.
Killer whale ecotypes are morphologically recognizable forms that prefer different prey and as a result they have different foraging strategies, acoustic behaviour, and habitat preferences. Divergence likely originates through natural selection of an intelligent social animal that transmits cultural heritages within stable family groups [49]. A likely explanation for these differences in killer whale prey preferences would consider the profitability and risk of attack choices. Smaller marine mammal prey, such as seals, is not as profitable as baleen whales but presumably have lower risk of injury or death to the predator during an attack. At lower latitudes in less productive tropical waters, killer whales may have to be generalists [50, 51] but at higher latitudes in more productive marine ecosystems killer whales typically specialize and the number of ecotypes appears to increase with increasing prey density. As many as three sympatric ecotypes have been reported in different communities (data on file) and this is a reasonable working hypothesis for the northwest Atlantic where fish-eaters have been observed in southern Greenland and Newfoundland and Labrador waters, shark-eaters may occur offshore, and marine mammal specialists enter the region seasonally. For the eastern Canadian Arctic, during the open-water season, the mammal-eating ecotype predominates. And it is this type of killer whale that Inuit are familiar with and it is the foraging behaviour of this type that we have documented using Inuit TEK.
Baleen whales, including bowheads, and Arctic odontocetes show strong seasonal migration patterns that include intensive feeding during spring through fall building up blubber stores for a winter season where feeding is rare. The eastern Canadian Arctic marine-mammal-eating killer whales also cycle seasonally in both summer-winter ranges and energy intake. In particular, arrival into the Arctic during the open-water season coincides with timing of peak pupping and calving that would presumably provide more easily accessible prey for killer whales. It has been estimated that higher latitude killer whale food intake rates during summer are approximately double the rest of the year [50]. Another study estimated that killer whales at high latitudes input 50% of their annual intake during a 90 day summer period [11]. As with many high-latitude large-bodied mammals, killer whales undergo an intense feeding period during summer followed by a relatively inactive negative energy period over winter. Inuit knowledge and observations have provided substantial information necessary to estimate seasonal variation in killer whale feeding needed to better assess the regulatory role of killer whale predation on their prey.
Hunting behavior
A significant body of literature exists on the hunting behavior of killer whales and the responses of their prey. For example, numerous previous studies have described prey species fleeing to shallow waters to escape from killer whales [26, 39, 48, 52–54]. Many of these sources also note the influence of killer whales on the movements of bowhead, narwhal and beluga whales [26, 39, 53–58]. The methods used by killer whales to kill marine mammal prey have also been described by interviewees in previous studies, as has the fact that killer whales do not always consume everything and leave pieces of skin and blubber behind which are sometimes collected by Inuit [26, 36, 39, 45, 59].
The results of our TEK study compliment the results of other studies and provides some new insights on foraging behavior in Nunavut waters. For example, Inuit observed killer whales attacking and killing large whales and then only consuming parts. Observations of killer whale eating baleen whales include ripping out only tongues and lips, the favored parts [17].
Most recorded attacks of killer whales on large whales are by relatively small groups of killer whales (1-5 [60]), as observed by Inuit [24]. Transient killer whales encountered around Southern California in April and May hunting gray whale calves involve groups of 2-4 individuals conducting the attacks [61]. Inuit have observed that killer whales are like canids (e.g., wolves Canis lupus) that hunt cooperatively and attack in a coordinated manner through communication when preying on ungulates [62, 63]. Inuit observations also indicate that killer whales are cooperative pack hunters, like wolves, when pursuing fast or dangerous prey. Inuit observed that killer whales use prey capture techniques that utilize prior knowledge of landscape such as attacking prey before they can seek shallow water refuge [64–66]. Inuit observed that killer whales wash seals off of sea ice as observed in Antarctica [16, 67].
Inuit ecological knowledge also provides new information that indicates that cetacean prey use sea ice as a refuge from killer whale predation, which has only been suggested in scientific literature [68–70]. Although noted for other regions [71, 72], Inuit described Arctic killer whale foraging behaviour that involves a strategy of searching, finding prey, giving chase, and if unsuccessful, then waiting to see if prey leave refugia and following the landscape shoreline topography for opportunities to attack. An Igloolik interviewee observed a killer whale chasing a bowhead whale cow and calf, with the calf being held out of the water. The interviewee thought that the cow was underneath the calf holding it out of the water to protect it. Grey whales (Eschrichtius robustus) have been observed to respond to killer whale attacks by rolling at the surface to keep their ventral area from being exposed to killer whales below, and mothers have been observed to roll over and hold their calf above the water on their ventral surface to keep it away from killer whales [73, 74]. To our knowledge, this report from Igloolik is the first time this behaviour has been noted for bowhead whales.
Marine mammal scientists have observed and described sophisticated techniques used by Antarctic Type B killer whales to hunt seals on ice floes [16, 75]. Eastern Arctic killer whales are occasionally observed near light to moderate ice, and south Baffin interviewees described similar hunting behaviour with killer whales washing seals off ice floes (also see [24]). Although it has not been observed or described by scientists, Inuit have long recognized different hunting techniques killer whales use to catch seals on ice floes. In 1790, Fabricius noted reports from West Greenland hunters where killer whales worked in unison to lift an ice floe from underneath and cause harp seals to fall off into the water [76]. On northern Baffin Island, hunters have similarly seen killer whales surround an ice floe while one pushes up from underneath to break the ice and force seals into the water [55]. These observations add to a growing body of knowledge on the use of advanced and sophisticated hunting behaviour by killer whales.
In most cases the information provided in different communities and regions was complementary (e.g., prey items, prey avoidance behaviour, attack techniques). However, there is disagreement among opinions and/or observations of different behavior. Several Repulse Bay interviewees suggested that killer whale do not normally attack tusked narwhal and that only females are found dead. The same information has been reported previously [26], possibly from the same local experts. These observations are contrasted by those of other interviewees who indicate that tusked narwhal are killed on occasion. In northwest Greenland (Avanersuaq District), hunters have also observed killer whales attacking and killing both male and female narwhal [45]. A Pond Inlet interviewee reported a story of a narwhal piercing a killer whale with its tusk, suggesting that male narwhal are dangerous to attack. Rosing [77] described an observation from Greenland in December 1924 where killer whales were observed killing narwhal and one was seen jumping out of the water with a narwhal stuck to its side, with its tusk penetrating to the root straight through the killer whale. During interviews for the Igloolik Oral History project [78], an elder provided a story [79] of a dead killer whale that was found in the waters of qaqqalik (possibly near Kimmirut) that had a narwhal tusk pierced through its mouth.
Conclusion
Inuit observations have provided a sound background of ecological information detailing Arctic killer whale feeding habits including hunting techniques that are specific to prey species and prey behavior associated with reducing the risk of killer whale attacks being successful. Such knowledge is critical to management and conservation efforts to ensure persistence of sustainable Inuit cultural hunting. Given the importance of long-term relationships between scientists and hunters for successful knowledge integration, this study provides an example of the potential for meaningful integration in short-term projects such as incorporating Inuit understanding of the ecology of killer whale predation in an assessment of the forms of active participation by TEK-holders in science development. We expect considerable improvement in knowledge of killer whale ecology relevant to management as scientists and Inuit combine forces to tackle a major conservation issue - the rapid shifting of the Arctic marine ecosystem structure associated with warming and loss of sea ice.

Abstract
Background
Community food programs (CFPs), including soup kitchens and food banks, are a recent development in larger settlements in the Canadian Arctic. Our understanding of utilization of these programs is limited as food systems research has not studied the marginalised and transient populations using CFPs, constraining service planning for some of the most vulnerable community members. This paper reports on a baseline study conducted with users of CFPs in Iqaluit, Nunavut, to identify and characterize utilization and document their food security experience.
Methods
Open ended interviews and a fixed-choice survey on a census (n = 94) were conducted with of users of the food bank, soup kitchen, and friendship centre over a 1 month period, along with key informant interviews.
Results
Users of CFPs are more likely to be Inuit, be unemployed, and have not completed high school compared to the general Iqaluit population, while also reporting high dependence on social assistance, low household income, and an absence of hunters in the household. The majority report using CFPs for over a year and on a regular basis.
Conclusions
The inability of users to obtain sufficient food must be understood in the context of socio-economic transformations that have affected Inuit society over the last half century as former semi-nomadic hunting groups were resettled into permanent settlements. The resulting livelihood changes profoundly affected how food is produced, processed, distributed, and consumed, and the socio-cultural relationships surrounding such activities. Consequences have included the rising importance of material resources for food access, the weakening of social safety mechanisms through which more vulnerable community members would have traditionally been supported, and acculturative stress. Addressing these broader challenges is essential for food policy, yet CFPs also have an essential role in providing for those who would otherwise have limited food access.
Background
Food insecurity is a chronic problem affecting Inuit settlements in Canada. In Nunavut Territory, for instance, 56% of the Inuit population is estimated to be food-insecure [1], with community studies indicating prevalence ranging from 50 to 80% [2–5]. This significantly exceeds the Canadian average and includes high prevalence among children [6]. Food insecurity is reflective of, and in turn contributes to, the poor health status of Inuit, and has been identified as one of the major policy challenges facing northern governments [7–15].
The last two decades have witnessed a proliferation of research examining Inuit food systems, proving insight on food (in)security. Inuit food systems combine interdependence on traditional components based on subsistence hunting and fishing activities – which remain a major source of food [16] – and market based or store foods. Early food research in Arctic Canada focused on sharing in contemporary Inuit society, examining customary rules governing how traditional foods are produced, processed, distributed, prepared and consumed [17–20]. More recently, this work has examined how traditional food systems are changing and what this means for food security at a community level [21–27]. In the early 1990s research also began to examine contaminants in traditional foods and associated health implications, as it became clear that Arctic regions were accumulating contaminants emitted in the south; this remains an important focus of study [28–30]. Concern over contaminants, along with broader interest in dietary change, in turn provided impetus for research documenting dietary consumption patterns, examining change in dietary habits over time, and assessing the adequacy of nutrient intakes [5, 6, 31–44]. Some of these studies have utilized modified versions of the Radimer/Cornell and USDA household food questionnaire to quantify prevalence of food insecurity [1–5].
The literature develops an understanding of the magnitude of the food security challenge facing Inuit communities and the roles played by various factors. A preference for working in small, remote, and more traditional communities (population <1500) is discernible along with a focus on the traditional food component of the food system. Vulnerable groups including children and females have been the focus of a few recent studies [4, 6, 45]. The experience and determinants of food insecurity in the larger regional Inuit centers (RICs) (e.g. Iqaluit, Inuvik), however, have been largely unexamined. These regional centers differ significantly from the smaller communities that have been the focus of research, with their administrative functions, rapidly developing economies, transport links, and rapid in-migration, with livelihoods combining a strong dependence on the waged economy alongside continued importance on subsistence-based harvesting activities [46–48].
Employment opportunities in RICs and lower retail prices for store food relative to what is found in smaller communities which are more remote from larger food distribution routes are likely, on the one hand, to moderate food insecurity compared to smaller communities, where poverty and unemployment are major constraints on the ability to access food. Equally, research has indicated that social networks through which traditional foods are shared between and within households are often weaker in RICs, a function of demographics, predominance of livelihoods based on the waged economy, in-migration and transiency in habitation [47–49]. Moreover, the larger settlements, while increasingly prosperous, have significant pockets of inequality, characterized by high and persistent unemployment, poverty, and house overcrowding [50, 51]. For this ‘underclass,’ food insecurity is typically chronic and manifest in an inability to access traditional or store foods [48]. In response, community food programs (CFPs) have been initiated in some RICs, including the development of food banks and soup kitchens. Such support mechanisms are a recent development in the Canadian Arctic and reflect the challenges faced in the context of modernization, acculturation, and population growth.
While there is a well developed literature on CFPs in urban areas of southern Canada, very little is known in a Canadian Arctic context, or indeed the Arctic more generally. Who is using CFPs? How often? Why? Is use changing over time? How are food programs perceived? These are important questions, particularly in-light of stressors such as climate change, the rising cost of living, changing sharing networks, and population growth, all of which have the potential to increase demand for formalized food services. Policy makers and program coordinators have identified this knowledge gap as challenging service planning for this segment of the population, who have historically been neglected in food system initiatives [48]. This gap partly reflects the challenging nature of researching marginalised and transient populations using CFPs who are sometimes homeless and living in shelters or in temporary housing. These individuals are unlikely to be captured in research recruiting study participants randomly based upon housing lists and maps (e.g. Inuit Health Survey) or in qualitative studies using convenience or snowball sampling. Rather, they need to be explicitly targeted as a vulnerable sub-population. This paper is situated within this context, and employs a mixed methods research approach to document and examine utilization and the food security experience of users of CFPs drawing upon a case study from Iqaluit, Nunavut. In developing a baseline understanding of utilization and determining factors, we close by examining policy interventions to strengthen current food programming targeted at vulnerable community members.
Methods
Case study: Iqaluit, Nunavut
Iqaluit is the territorial capital of Nunavut, Canada, with population of 6185 (58% Inuit) (Table 1). Located on southern Baffin Island at the head of Frobisher Bay (Figure 1), the community’s economy consists primarily of waged employment and many Inuit and non-Inuit are attracted to the area for jobs [47]. Hunting remains a strong part of community life with seal, caribou, walrus, various fish, and beluga whale regularly harvested. Iqaluit is the largest community in Nunavut, and the only location with a hospital, a young offender’s centre, and jails and shelters for both men and women. As a rapidly growing town and magnet for people from other settlements, Iqaluit’s population is more transient than other Nunavut communities. The Inuit population in Iqaluit grew by 17.6% between 2001 and 2006, compared with a 9.2% increase in Nunavut as a whole. Iqaluit is one of the few communities in the Canadian Arctic with a number of CFPs providing for those in need, including a food bank with bi-monthly distributions and a soup kitchen that serves daily meals. A drop in centre – the Tukisigiarvik Friendship Centre (“place to find understanding” in Inuktitut) – was established in 2003, with traditional foods are available on a daily basis.
The challenges facing Iqaluit residents are characteristic of those facing RICs in the Canadian north more broadly. While increasingly prosperous as the capital of one of Canada’s fastest growing regions, inequality in income, employment opportunities, and health outcomes are pronounced [47, 49]. In particular, for those without a formal education, who suffer from mental health or addiction-related problems, or have a criminal record, finding a stable job is difficult. Hidden homelessness or house insecurity is also an increasing problem, characterized by an inability of individuals or families to find stable housing [49, 51].
Data collection
A community based participatory research (CBPR) approach guided the study, with research questions identified during consultation with territorial level policy makers, local leaders, community members, and northern science bodies. This was followed with a one week photovoice workshop with 8 regular users of the food bank to assist with project development and identify research needs and questions [48]. This work informed the creation of a mixed-methods approach to data collection involving a fixed-choice survey and open ended questions with the aim of documenting and examining CFP utilization and food security experience. Mixed methods enabled the collection of standardized data and quantitative analysis while also allowing users to describe in their own words their experiences. The research team – consisting of university-based researchers, community health professionals, and two local research assistants who were users of food programs – evaluated the results with participants. The research followed ethical norms for working with communities in northern Canada, including obtaining university research ethics board consent from McGill University (REB#: 65–0710), a research license from the Nunavut Research Institute (#0104810 NA), eliciting informed consent from all study participants, and ensuring confidentiality of participants.
A census of clientele using CFPs during May 2010 (n = 94) was conducted. This involved the research team visiting the food programs during hours of operation, at which time users were randomly asked to participate. Sampling continued over a 4 week period until theoretical saturation was reached, at which no new users were identified. Each participant was first asked a series of fixed-choice close-ended survey questions covering socio-demographic-livelihood characteristics, food access, and frequency of use of CFPs (Table 2). A locally adapted version of the U.S. Department of Agriculture Food Security Module (FFSM) was then administered. Due to the fact that the target population consisted of regular users of CFPs, it was assumed that they already experienced food insecurity and the survey therefore used only 4 locally adapted questions of the standard 6 item subset of the 12 month FFSM, which are also part of the core domains of the food insecurity experience shared across cultures [52]. These questions focus on the experience of not having enough food in the household, reducing food portions and switching to cheaper foods. Questions on coping strategies were adapted from the coping strategies index developed by Maxwell et al. [53]. Following the survey, open-ended questions were asked in order to examine and document, in the user’s own words, perceptions of the services offered, why they were using the food programs, and the nature of food insecurity experienced.
Participants received a $40 CAN gift card for the local supermarket for their time and all questions were asked in the language of choice (English or Inuktitut). Recruitment and interviewing took place during hours of operation of the respective programs and in a private setting to ensure confidentiality. The questions were pre-tested and evaluated by the team to ensure appropriateness and effectiveness. Additional data was obtained from handwritten records on utilization kept by the food bank (for 2007–2009), soup kitchen (for 2005–2009), and Tukisigiarvik (for 2003–2009), which were entered into excel for analysis. Key informant interviews were also conducted with the territorial nutritionist, personnel at the CFPs, and the Quajigiartiit Health Research Network, the Nunavut Research Institute and the Inuit Institute for Research and Planning to obtain multiple perspectives on utilization, and complimented by participant observation in which researchers volunteered at the various CFPs.
Analysis
Data were analyzed in SPSS 15.0. Basic descriptive statistics were used to describe the sample population, responses to each question, and to ascertain the distribution of responses by age, sex, occupation, and hunting behaviour. Chi-squared (x 2) analysis and Fischer exact tests were performed to test for significant differences between participant characteristics and response to questions, and to compare the sample population with that of Iqaluit (where community-level data was available). Significance was set at p < 0.05. Open-ended questions were used to explore participant’s experiences and perceptions of CFPs in Iqaluit. Coding was used to sort qualitative answers in content related categories by using non-automated frequency counts and through latent content analysis.
Results
Ninety four interviews were conducted. Socio-demographic characteristics of the sample population are provided in Table 1.
Community food programs in Iqaluit are widely used and valued
In 2008–2009, the food bank distributed food to 365 households (18.1% of total number of households in Iqaluit based on 2006 census). Peaks in attendance occur in early winter (November, December), while fewer clients used their services in the fall and summer (Figure 1). The soup kitchen had an average of 275 days of operation per year between 2005 and 2009, and serves an average of 9984 meals annually, primarily to adults (Figure 2). The soup kitchen had its peak attendance in 2005, receiving an average of 43 people per operation day during its first year of operation when it was open seven days per week for lunch and dinner, and every month of the year. In recent years the soup kitchen’s operation has been curtailed with a reduction of service from two meals per day seven days a week, to one meal per day five days a week. In 2009, it served meals to an average of 36 people per day. Tukisigiarvik received 3828 drop-ins in 2008–2009, an increase from the 3690 drop-ins that were made in 2004–2005. These drop-ins include stopping for counselling, sharing traditional foods, doing laundry and participating in cultural activities.
""""When I come [to the soup kitchen], it reduces the number of people to feed in my house"" (female, 35–44 yrs old, full time worker)""
""""We don’t have a choice, we don’t have money to buy food"" (male, 45–54 yrs old, unemployed)""
""""The food bank is very helpful, especially having 2 small kids who don’t understand there is no food""(female, 45–54 yrs old, unemployed)""
""""We can’t find people to help. If it weren’t for these services, we would go hungry"" (female, 45–54 yrs old, unemployed)""
CFPs were highly valued among users, with 82% reporting that they regularly help alleviate hunger, while the absence of other options for accessing food during times of need was widely noted. Participants explained that these programs provide more than a source of food, increasing a sense of well-being by decreasing anxiety about not being able to afford food and reducing feelings of helplessness:
""""I feel really bad when children are hungry, and I like knowing that these organizations can help them"" (female, 18–24 yrs old, unemployed)""
""""Makes it easier, because I have no money or work"" (female,35-44 yrs old, unemployed)""
""""When I get very depressed from hunger, they lift me up"" (female, 45–54 yrs old, part time worker)""
""""It would be really stressful if [the food programs] didn’t exist"" (male, 25–34 yrs old, unemployed)""
""""There would be a lot more social problems without these organisations"" (male, 25–34 yrs old, unemployed)""
Repeat use is common
The food bank was used at least once a month for 79% of respondents, the soup kitchen was used two times or more per week for 81%, and Tukisigiarvik was used at least two times per week for 70% of the respondents. Sixty two percent reported using all three services, with the majority using the CFPs for one year or longer (65% for the food bank, 59% for the soup kitchen and Tukisigiarvik). CFPs are typically the main source of food for these users, and often represent the most reliable source they can access. There was no association between gender and frequency of use of CFP’s, although men were more likely to report going to Tukisigiarvik then women (p = 0.05). Finally, there was no association between employment status (employment defined as a wage earning activity and including part time work), nor place of birth and frequency of use of CFP’s. However, a small sample size, particularly for those employed and not using CFP’s, is likely to have reduced statistical power to detect an association between employment and CFP use. A larger sample size would be required to detect an association.
Users are primarily Inuit, born in Iqaluit, unemployed and did not complete high school
Comparing the prolife of CFP users with socio-economic indicators of Iqaluit obtained from the 2006 census indicates that users are significantly more likely to be Inuit (p < 0.01 Fisher’s Exact test), with 97% self identifying as Inuit compared to 58% for the community as a whole. Users were also more likely to be unemployed (p < 0.01 Chi-squared test), with 72% reporting to be unemployed at the time of the survey: eight times greater than the community as a whole. Twelve percent reported working full time, 7% worked part time, 4% were full-time hunters or fishers and 2% were involved in traditional craft production (i.e. carving). Significantly fewer users reported completing high school (13%) (p < 0.01 Chi-squared test) compared to the general population, where 66% completed high school. Twelve percent reported having some post secondary education, primarily involving learning a trade. No statistical relationships were documented between users and the general population for gender, where 56% of respondents were male and 46% female, or age.
The majority of users (76%) were born in Iqaluit and of those born elsewhere, over three quarters were from other Nunavut communities and two thirds had lived for more than five years in Iqaluit. Social assistance was the main source of income for 61% of respondents, whereas employment was the main source of income for 26% of participants, with another 13% reporting other benefits or non waged work, such as carving, as their main source of income (Table 1). While the majority of employed participants said that the main source of income in their household was from employment, some said that although they were employed, the main source of income in their household was from income support. In some cases, participants lived in households where they were the only employed member of the household and their salary could not support all members in the household. In such cases, they considered that the main source of income at the household level was from income support.
When asked if income was enough for their needs, 57% of respondents answered rarely or never. Lack of adequate shelter was a concern for many users, with 16% of respondents either homeless or living in shelters at the time of the interview. Others reported living alone (23%), in households with 2 people (16%), 3–4 people (31%), 5 to 8 people (21%), and 9 or more (9%). Of those participants (46%) who said that there where times during the year when they had more people in their house, 30% said that the reason for this was because they had to help out family members and friends who had nowhere else to stay. Lack of shelter was identified as a major constrant to accessing food. As one partcipant said,""It is hard to have food in the house when there is no house."" (male, 25–34 yrs old, homeless)
The majority of users live in households without hunters
Three quarters of respondents reported living in a household without a hunter, which was described as making it difficult to obtain traditional food on a regular and predictable basis. While most (72%) reported that they could access traditional foods through sharing, this is dependent on the hunting success of family members and friends and on their willingness to share. Close to one third (28%) of the respondents said that they did not have anyone who could share country food with them, and there was no difference between men or women. Tukisigiarvik provides an important source of traditional foods herein and represented the main source of traditional foods for 33% of respondents. Equally, living in a household with a hunter did not protect against running out of food in the house and being unable to acquire more, as there was no statistically significant difference in the number of households with or without a hunter reporting running out of food in the past year. Also, there was no statistically different level of use of any of the three community food programs between households with a hunter and households without a hunter.
Users are regularly not able to access food and CFP use is one of a number of coping mechanisms
Running out of food was a major concern for the majority of the respondents, with 89% reporting that in the last year there had been times where they had no food in the household. Along with relying on CFPs, coping strategies documented to manage lack of food access included switching to cheaper foods that were often less preferable (87%), reducing portion sizes (72%), reducing portion sizes of other members of the household (60%), sending people to eat elsewhere (53%) and selling belongings to get money for food (49%). Due to the sensitive nature of this question, we did not ask for a description of those items, yet some study participants did specify having to sell hunting equipment to access money. We did not detect any statistically significant differences between males or females, presence or absence of a hunter in the household or being born in Iqaluit in the responses on coping strategies or food security. Reasons given to explain why there had been times without food in the household included: lack of money (36%), unemployment (27%), having to help others (12%), addictions (8%) and food being too expensive (6%).
Early winter is the most difficult time to access food
Over half of the respondents (54%) said that early winter (November, December) was the most difficult time of the year to access food, with fewer reporting fall or spring (9%) or the summer (7%), to be difficult times. One fifth (21%) of respondents said that they saw no difference in difficulties accessing food between seasons. Utilization data indicates that these are generally the times of greatest usage of CFPs, although the records are temporally limited. One fifth of respondents reported that there were no differences between seasons when accessing food. Reasons given to explain why certain times were more difficult than others during the year were because there was less hunting in the community (31%), bad weather (14%), because expenses go up during that time (15%) and due to unemployment or lack or stable employment (10%). Also, 17% of respondents mentioned that the most difficult time of the year was when services providing food where closed. Services sometimes close during bad weather events, holidays, the summer or when their own staff or volunteers are in insufficient numbers to operate the facilities. When asked about difficult times of the month, the majority (45%) said it was when they had insufficient money in the household, mostly due to income support being too low, and while they were between cheques (36%).
""""In the winter, there are less country foods. Foods at the store are more expensive, there are more things to pay for""""
""""Between income support cheques, I am broke""""
Limited access to financial means reported as the main challenge to achieving food security
Finally, when asked about the main challenge to achieving a sense of food security at the household level, 35% of participants answered unemployment. Closely following unemployment was income support being too low or not having enough money (26%) and the need to support other members of the family or household crowding (14%). The high cost of food was the main difficulty for 12% of respondents, dealing with addictions was the main challenge for 8% of participants and 6% of answers had various other reasons.
Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first study to document and examine utilization of CFPs in the Canadian Arctic, and the Arctic more generally. The data provide a snapshot of utilization at a specific point in time (May 2010), and while we interviewed all users over a 4-week period, we recognize that we will have missed those who use the programs at other times of the year. The study describes users of CFPs who typically have a low level of formal education, are unemployed, rely on social assistance, and have a low household income. This is not surprising, with utilization profiles similar to those in southern urban centres [54, 55]. Contrary to our expectation that new arrivals to Iqaluit would be overrepresented in utilization of CFPs reflecting the breadth and quality of their social ties, the majority of users were born in Iqaluit, and of those from elsewhere, the majority had been living in Iqaluit for more than five years. Lack of shelter is a challenge facing many CFP users, especially ‘hidden homelessness’ characterized by a lack of a secure and permanent dwelling, involving individuals and families moving from one temporary housing situation to another [51, 56]. These situations are typical for users of CFPs, and compound challenges of finding a job, getting an education, recovering from previous trauma, and achieving food security. Housing is a broader problem in Nunavut, where overcrowding in substandard houses is widespread [47, 51, 57]. While addictive behaviour was reported by 9% of participants as a reason why they had difficulties obtaining food, this likely reflects the nature of the research approach (i.e. formal survey/interview), with key informants and some users noting that addiction is major problem facing those using CFPs. We did not detect an association between employment status, place of birth, gender, age, presence of hunter in the household and utilization of CFPs. This is likely due to both low sample size, as well as low variation in the data.
The role of low income, limited educational achievement, unemployment, hidden homelessness, and addictive behaviour represent proximate causes of food insecurity and CFP use, and form part of what Coates et al. [58] describe as a ‘cluster of problems’ affecting food systems in multiple geographic and cultural contexts. These challenges are particularly acute in Arctic Canada where the cost of living and reliance on a limited number of economic sectors is high [59]. Food in Nunavut, for example, on average costs twice as much in southern urban centres with household income significantly lower [45, 59, 60]. Ultimately, these causes can only be understood in the context of sweeping socio-economic transformations that have affected Inuit society over the last half century as former semi-nomadic hunting groups were resettled into permanent settlements beginning in the 1950s and incorporated into a colonial relationship with the Canadian state, detailed descriptions of which are provided elsewhere [12, 17, 61–63]. Iqaluit was one of the first permanently settled communities in the eastern Arctic, beginning with the building of a US Air Force base in 1942 [47, 62, 64]. This was accompanied by rapid socio-cultural change with the associated development of the formal education system, relative decline in hunting, expansion of the wage-based economy, and rapid population growth [17, 65–69], with implications for how food is produced, processed, distributed, and consumed, and hence food security.
The nutrition transition is one consequence of these broader influences, with the rising consumption of store foods at the expense of traditional foods widely documented across Inuit communities [4, 33], access to which is determined by monetary resources in contrast to the moral economy of reciprocity and exchange that governed access to traditional food [17, 18, 70, 71]. There was historically little need for formalized food programs, as household sharing networks would ensure food access (except during periods when wildlife resources were scarce). Sharing networks continue to be important for Inuit – differentiating the northern CFP experience from that in the south – and the majority of respondents reported that they could access traditional foods through such networks, which is important given the limited number of participants who reported having hunters in the household. Nevertheless, as documented here and elsewhere, in a contemporary context in which hunting is expensive, harvest success is being affected by climate change, and fewer people are engaging in harvesting activities, increasing demands are being placed on diminishing supply of traditional foods [21, 61, 72–78]. Sharing outside of the household – the primary means of traditional food access for CFP users – is therefore often unpredictable and infrequent, especially for those with less to offer in terms of reciprocity (e.g. material resources). For the more vulnerable members of the community who do not have access to financial resources or have stable housing, this diminished social safety net leaves few alternatives but to use CFPs. The vulnerability of sharing networks is particularly apparent in enhanced CFP usage in November and December, times of the year when traditional foods are hard to access due to ice freeze-up and uncertain snow conditions on inland trails which limit the ability to hunt [73, 79]. At these times, sharing concentrates among those in the immediate household and for elders.
Another consequence of these broader changes has been significant acculturative stress among northern populations, linked to the rapid changes in livelihoods and culture, and experience of residential schools [10, 12, 80–83]. Many of the older respondents were born and raised in small hunting camps, resettled in Iqaluit, spent time at tuberculosis sanatoria in southern Canada in the 1950s and 60s, and now live in a modern community. The significant associated acculturative stress and intergenerational trauma provides the context for many of the social and health challenges facing Inuit communities including Iqaluit [13, 74]. Thus the financial constraints faced by many CFP users reflect more than the cost of food and unemployment; they are exacerbated by household financial management skills, problems of addiction, and poor living conditions associated with acculturation and recent development of the monetary economy [63, 82, 84]. Similarly, problems of addiction need to be situated in the context of past abuse and also changing relationships with the environment. The land is a fundamental component of Inuit culture and central to health and well-being – both through the act of hunting and being on the land, and also the act of sharing and consuming traditional foods – yet for CFP users this link was often lacking: few were able to afford to hunt, instead relying on sharing for traditional food access. This directly affects food availability, but also has broader ramifications for well-being [85].
In-light of the magnitude of food insecurity in the Canadian north, food policy is increasingly recognized as a central component of anti-poverty/community development strategies. Addressing the broader determinants of food insecurity is essential for such policy interventions, yet the pervasiveness and persistence of these causes despite recognition at a policy level is indicative of the challenging nature of intervention required. Moreover, at a community level, such ultimate causes are often beyond the scope of what can be achieved, necessitating broad-scale territorial and federal involvement [14]. In this context, while CFPs do not address root causes, they provide a valuable service for a community undergoing rapid change. While it has been argued in the general scholarship and among some northern commentators that CFPs can create dependency and thereby increase food insecurity in the long-term, users in Iqaluit have few alternative sources of food, and numerous barriers make it difficult for users to obtain waged employment necessary for food access. CFPs also provide much more than food. They offer a safe place to go, and in the case of Tukisigiarvik, provide access to culturally important traditional foods which many otherwise would not have access to. Herein, this work suggests a number of priorities for food policy in Iqaluit:
· Continuing support for CFPs. While the food bank and soup kitchen rely on donations, Tukisigiarvik recently lost most of their funding as their grant from the Aboriginal Healing Foundation came to end in 2010. The center represents an intervention developed by Iqaluit’s Inuit population after consultations identified the need for a wellness, counselling and advice center to help Inuit in Iqaluit cope with the health and social issues they face. It draws upon traditional approaches that recognize food insecurity to be representative of broader socio-cultural challenges, and as such provides more than just food for those in need including counselling, cultural activities, advice on life skills, and structure.
· Promotion of traditional foods at the food bank and soup kitchen. Many participants expressed their gratitude towards the foods offered at the food bank and soup kitchen. However, many also expressed desire to see traditional foods being incorporated in the menus of the soup kitchen, or being offered at the food bank because of the difficulty they have obtaining them otherwise, and more diversity of foods offered. Currently however, the food bank can not serve traditional foods harvested locally because of food safety regulations.
· Education on how to make the best of store foods offered at the food bank. Items offered through the food bank are through local donations, and users often reported not knowing how to make use of the food received. The development of cooking classes, pamphlets with recipes, and workshops that teach users how to get the most nutritional value out of the distributed foods were identified as important, and could be undertaken at little cost .
· In addition, a number of broader initiatives are needed to strengthen the traditional food component of the food system. Maintaining access to traditional foods is widely recognized as essential for secure food systems in Inuit communities, providing culturally valued nutritious food [14, 59].
· Enhanced support mechanisms to ensure that CFP users can access hunting equipment. Many participants reported having to sell hunting equipment to access money to buy food, resulting in short term access to material resources but loss of the means of harvesting in the long term, with associated food security implications. Many also reported having hunting skills but no equipment, or could not go hunting because of the cost associated with hunting. A number of hunter support mechanisms are available in Nunavut, and were reviewed by Ford et al. [73, 86]. The challenge for CFP users is that many would not meet the requirements for such support mechanisms, while in a community the size of Iqaluit demand for assistance significantly exceeds the resources available. An alternative intervention to the individual focused grants aimed at full time hunters would be a co-op system to allow community members without equipment to access hunting gear. This would provide access for those who want to harvest part-time, prevent people from feeling the need to sell hunting equipment, and spread limited resources around the community. As one participant said: ""I used to be able to hunt before moving here, but not anymore, because I don’t have gear"" (male , 25–34 years old, unemployed.
· Sharing networks to distribute country foods need to be preserved and facilitated: Sharing of traditional foods remains important in Iqaluit and for CFP users, although the long-term sustainability of such practices has been questioned in light of socio-economic transformations. Initiatives that facilitate the sharing of traditional foods are needed, with community freezers, reduced cargo cost for shipping of traditional foods between communities, support for the new traditional food market in Iqaluit, subsidies on traditional foods sold at stores, and subsidies to hunters to allow them to go hunting, all offering potential entry points.
Conclusions
Community food programs (CFPs) provide an important service to chronically food insecure households in Iqaluit, Nunavut. Users are among the most vulnerable community members, and typically have low level of education, are unemployed, have limited access to material resources, and have insecure housing. These challenges reflect a complex socio-cultural-political context reflecting rapid transformation in Inuit livelihoods over the past half century, combined with the high cost of living in the north. The baseline study identifies a number of community level priorities for intervention including continuing support for CFPs, promotion of traditional foods at the food bank and soup kitchen, education of using foods offered through CFPs, alongside broader policies to support the harvesting sector. Future research will examine policy interventions in greater depth, with the territorial and federal government increasingly cognizant of the challenges faced by the most vulnerable of Arctic residents.

3.1 The JP Program
In the absence of legislative changes, the Nunavut JP program is operating under the same terms as the previous GNWT program in the initial stages. Accordingly, the JPs jurisdiction is set out in the Criminal Code, however the extent to which JPs exercise their full jurisdiction depends on other factors. Following their appointments, the Chief Justice of the Court of Justice is responsible for directing JPs and assigning duties.
Depending on the level and the assigned duties, JPs are authorized to conduct trials of any by-law offence, territorial offence, or federal summary offence (but not trials involving a young offender).[38] They can impose jail sentences of up to 18 months. They are also authorized to conduct judicial interim release hearings for both adults and young offenders, issue or cancel search warrants under all federal and territorial statutes, conduct remand courts for criminal matters and bail applications, peace bond hearings and perform other judicial functions. JPs are empowered to conduct some preliminary inquiries and hear guilty pleas, however, prior to April 1, 1999, no JP had conducted a preliminary inquiry in Nunavut (or elsewhere in the NWT).
With the creation of a unified court system, it is anticipated that JPs will be in a position to take on more of the minor cases leaving the superior court to deal with the more serious cases. Although Bill C-57 did not expressly deal with JPs when she introduced Bill C-57, Justice Minister Ann McLellan described the Nunavut JPs as
“the key to the ability to deliver a high quality justice system.” [39]
Historically, JPs in Nunavut have not exercised all the powers available to them under the Criminal Code. In a Nunatsiaq News article about the JP program, the duties performed by Nunavut JPs are summarized into three areas of experience—
"" signing documents, hearing guilty pleas and conducting trials"" —which is considered by the Nunavut Government’s Deputy Minister of Justice to be the ""lower end of the scale"" compared to powers exercised by JPs in other parts of Canada.[40]
The absence of continuing education left many JPs uncomfortable with exercising duties that extended beyond swearing information, and arrest warrants.[41] In terms of cases, it is estimated that prior to April 1, 1999, JPs heard from 30% to 60% of all cases that came to court with the circuit courts hearing the indictable offence cases.[42]
The Nunavut Justice of the Peace program has a coordinator whose primary responsibility, as identified by the Deputy Minister, is recruiting and training JPs. Deputy Minister Nora Saunders briefly described this position as follows,
We see that this JP administrator will have a role in talking ahead of time to people who are considering [becoming a JP], perhaps by traveling to different communities and different regions and by talking with local officials about the kind of person needed, so that they have a sense of what that person’s expected to do.[43]
Prior to April 1, 1999, there were 82 individuals ( 26 women and 56 men) working as justices of the peace in 27 Nunavut communities.[44] The number of Inuit participating as JPs in the communities today was not available at the time this report was prepared. While most of the JPs have full time-employment other than as a JP, having JPs paid a salary remains an outstanding issue.[45] The Nunavut government is committed to ensuring JPs are paid for their services.
The NSDC presented an alternative to paying JPs a salary directly. It proposed establishing a protocol that would compensate employers of the JPs for the employee’s absence from work while performing jury duty.
3.2 The Strengths
The expanded role envisioned by the federal Minister of Justice is one shared by the Nunavut Department of Justice and reflective of the recommendations from the NSDC Justice Conference. None the less, both the Nunavut Deputy Minister and Assistant Deputy Minister of Justice have given assurances that an expanded role for JPs depends entirely upon the training made available and the willingness of JPs to take on these added responsibilities.[46]
At the NSDC justice conference, recommendations regarding JPs and their role in the Nunavut justice system were based on the following principles:
- Wherever possible, conflict should be resolved through consultation with those involved.
- If the conflict only involved a few people, these people should be the ones involved in the resolution of the conflict. It is not necessary to bring out the big guns every time.
- If the “lesser group” cannot resolve the problem, then access to larger or more influential individuals or groups is important.
- Every opportunity should be made to encourage a person to accept responsibility for what he or she did. This is somewhat contrary to the present system whereby people only accept responsibility if they are proven to be guilty, although there is some opportunity for people to plead “guilty”.[47]
The NSDC report notes that traditionally it is believed that hiding one’s guilt creates sickness in the individual and if hidden for a longer period of time, this sickness spreads to others around the individual, and those individuals also become sick or dysfunctional. Eventually the whole community could be infected with this sickness. It is not until the story is told and the person discloses his or her wrongdoing that those who are unhealthy can become healthy again. It is therefore important to deal with issues as soon as possible. Furthermore, where there was a breach of rules a consultation process would have to take place. Where it was a minor offence, the consultation would be within a family. If the breach resulted in a major offence, the consultation would be within the community.[48] It remains to be determined what factors are considering in making the distinction between major and minor offences (e.g. scale of impact of the offence on community members).
From these principles the NSDC recommends an expanded role for JPs and encourages JPs to
“involve others in helping to make decisions as to sentencing.” Wherever possible, families of both the accused and the victim should be involved. The victims should be involved as often as possible, recognizing that at times the victim might not feel comfortable in being involved and that it is important to protect and respect his or her rights. However, the traditional approach to dealing with problems generally involved everyone, including the victim.[49]
The NSDC recommendations regarding JPs are as follows:
- Increase community support for justices of the peace so that people are encouraged to take on the duties and responsibilities and so that people will feel more confident having matters dealt with in JP Court.[50]
- Increase the Justice of the Peace Training Program in order to meet the responsibilities JPs are provided with under the Criminal Code.[51] This should include providing more legal training programs to train JPs in laws and regulations that they must deal with, including the criminal law, family law, procedures of the court, young offenders law, and some civil law; and developing a justice of the peace support network.
- Change the way JP court operates to reflect the Inuit traditional practices of having groups not individuals make decisions.[52]
- The Court’s physical set up should be much less formal to facilitate consultation and lessen the adversarial approach.
- Screen all cases by the Justice of the Peace and the Community Justice Committee for referrals to the Community Justice Committee, Justice of the Peace court or higher court.
- Establish a protocol to deal with the employer of the JPs to allow time to be free for sittings and training. The idea of the protocol is to establish an arrangement whereby employers are compensated for the employee’s absence from work.
- Expand the sentencing options available to the Justices of the Peace, including Community Correctional Centres and Outpost Camps.
What is positive about the NSDC approach is the attempt to have Inuit culture and traditions form an integral part of the JP court structure and program, including JP selection, training and mandate. The NSDC recommendations reflect the work being done to ensure that while Inuit traditions and culture are respected and incorporated, the concerns of Inuit women regarding this inclusion are not overlooked. For example, in making the recommendation for all charges to go through an initial screening involving local JPs with the justice committees, the NSDC notes that concern was expressed about preserving the privacy of complainants in domestic assaults and sexual assault cases and ensuring that no pressure is brought to bear on these complainants. In response, the report states that
“it was felt that these types of cases should only be screened by the JPs and the justice committee if the complainant agrees to the process.” [53]
Likewise, the NSDC acknowledges that there was some discussion about actually having the JPs sit with “hand-picked” panels in certain instances such as sentencing hearings. These hand-picked panels would provide for the benefit of persons involved or involve those individuals who are considered most suited to deal with the particular matters. As the NSDC report states,
[t]raditionally, women would deal with matters which were considered “women’s issues” and men with the “men’s issues” and it may be that there are instances when it is appropriate to select a panel based on gender.[54]

thecanadianencyclopedia,https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/country-food-inuit-food-in-canada ,"Definition
Broadly speaking, “country food” can refer to a wide variety of cuisines prepared by locals in what is often a rural area. Typically, when used in Canada, and in reference to Indigenous peoples, country food describes traditional Inuit food. This includes marine life, such as shellfish, whales, seals and arctic char; birds and land animals, such as ducks, ptarmigan, bird eggs, bears, muskox and caribou; and plant life, including roots and berries. While some Inuit prefer the term “Inuit food” to refer to their traditional cuisine, the term “country food” is used more broadly. Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, the leading national Inuit organization in Canada, has used “country food” in its reports and research on Inuit health and food insecurity.
Preparation
The Inuit harvest, trap, hunt and fish for country food. To prepare such food for consumption, roots and berries must be cleaned, and animals require both cleaning and skinning. Traditional tools such as the ulu (a type of knife) are used in these preparation processes.
The Inuit use every part of the animal, if not for food than for other functions, such as clothing (animal hides and furs), heating (seal oil) and the making of various traditional tools (bones and sinew). In some communities, the predigested plant foods found in the stomachs of caribou are also consumed.
Meat is prepared in a variety of ways, depending on community and personal preferences. It can be boiled, dried, fermented, frozen, fried or eaten raw. Muktuk (or maktaaq) — pieces of whale skin with blubber (often from a narwhal, bowhead or beluga) — is a well-known country food consumed by the Inuit and sought after by tourists and food enthusiasts. Usually served raw, muktuk is an excellent source of vitamin C.
Health Benefits
The traditional Inuit diet — high in healthy fat and protein — is designed for Arctic living, as it keeps the Inuit energized and protects against starvation and death. Animal fat fuels hunters and warms the community. Historically, hunters avoided lean animals, such as rabbits, because without the appropriate fat content, the meat offered little nutrition and could lead to starvation, if relied on as the main or sole source of food. (See also Rabbit Starvation.)
Country food also has nutritional benefits. Vitamins A and D are plentiful in fish oils, and vitamin C is found in various meats, crowberries and raw kelp. Fish and meat also contain B vitamins and iron. Omega-3 fatty acids, found in fish, have anticlotting effects and help to lower triglycerides (body fats). Fish heads provide a good source of calcium. Even the fat of wild animals is considered healthy because its is less saturated than the fat commonly found in many processed foods.
The benefits of country food go beyond nutritional value. Harvesting requires outdoor activity, which can often be physically demanding. Such exercise prevents against illnesses partly associated with sedentary living, such as obesity and heart disease. Hunting and cooking with family and friends also keeps the community close and allows for the sharing of cultural practices.
DID YOU KNOW?
The nutritional value of country foods is thought to be one of the main reasons for which the Inuit did not fall victim to diseases of malnutrition and vitamin deficiency, such as scurvy, which killed many early European explorers in the Arctic. (See also Arctic Exploration and Franklin Search.)
Cultural Significance
To the Inuit, country food is about more than nutrition; it is also an expression of Inuit identity and culture. When elders teach young hunters how to subsist off the land, they are also teaching them about the lands and waters of the Arctic, and about the role that animals play in Inuit lives. Hunting for and preparing country food is a way of transmitting traditional knowledge.
Country food is also a way to promote and maintain self-sustaining communities. Some Inuit communities share food — a common cultural and historic practice. Sharing also offsets the high cost of food found in grocery stores and provides sustenance for those who might otherwise go hungry. Sharing food with community members is a form of respect, especially for elders.
In a spiritual way, country food nurtures the special connection between the Inuit and nature. It connects people to the earth, to the animals, to the waters and to one another. Country food is also a way of giving thanks to the animal that was sacrificed to provide sustenance for so many.
Food Insecurity
Food insecurity describes lack of access to sufficient and healthy food. According to the 2007–08 Inuit Health Survey, 70.5 per cent of Inuit adults live with food insecurity. Daily consumption of country food has decreased over time, from 23 per cent in 1999 to 16 per cent in 2008. Factors influencing food insecurity in the Arctic include socioeconomic changes, environmental concerns, hunting restrictions and financial challenges.
Socioeconomic Changes
Colonization profoundly altered the Inuit diet and way of life. Contact with European whalers began in the early 1700s, followed by relations with explorers in the early 1800s. Among other factors, the introduction of European goods, such as guns and steel tools, contributed to an economic dependence on European products and a decline in the use of traditional tools. Trading with the Hudson’s Bay Company only exacerbated this dependence over time.
The biggest changes to Inuit lifestyles arguably came in the 20th century. During the Cold War, the federal government became increasingly concerned about Arctic sovereignty. This turned political and military attention to the North and resulted in the building of the Distant Early Warning (DEW) Line along the Arctic coast, from Alaska eastward to Baffin Island and continuing to Greenland. ( See also Early-Warning Radar.) The DEW Line polluted and altered Arctic landscapes — problems that continue to impact Inuit communities. During the mid-1900s, the federal government also forcibly relocated Inuit families, at least partly as a means of populating isolated areas in the North for the purposes of Arctic sovereignty.
The mid- to late-1900s also brought with it a wage economy and the creation of permanent settlements in the North. Youth — many of whom were sent to residential schools — became detached from traditional ways of life, including the harvesting of country food. Socioeconomic changes therefore also contributed to a loss of culture. Subsistence patterns changed as hunters became more reliant on guns and motorized transport for hunting (as opposed to traditional tools and dogsledding), and on food shipped from outside the Arctic.
An imposed Westernized diet consists of expensive, flown-in foreign foods, such as fresh produce and certain dairy products, and inexpensive processed foods, which are more accessible but less healthy than country foods. Such products contain higher levels of sugar, salt and trans fats, and therefore contribute to higher rates of type 2 diabetes and heart disease among the Inuit. Poor nutrition is also linked to obesity, psychological development and maternal and child health, as well as higher rates of tuberculosis among the Inuit.
Environmental Concerns
Warmer temperatures, resulting in the melting of ice caps and a reduction in snow cover and permafrost, have profoundly affected the climate and ecosystems in Arctic Canada. (See also Climate Change.) Some animals, such as the muskox and polar bear, have been moving to new areas to survive. Inuit hunters are therefore forced to follow such animals along new and distant travel routes. Unpredictable weather patterns have also made sea ice hunting more dangerous and have shortened the hunting season, as the ice no longer freezes as quickly or as completely as it once did. Inuit food security is threatened by hunters’ increasing inability to harvest country food.
Pollution also poses health and safety hazards to the consumers of country food. Some Arctic animals are found to contain heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants (POPs). Inuit who eat foods containing these pollutants may be more susceptible to respiratory illnesses, birth defects and cancer. The Northern Contaminants Program (NCP), established by the federal government in 1991, found in 2009 that while levels of many POPs were declining, levels of some contaminants, such as mercury, were increasing. In addition to providing Northern communities with information about food sources, the NCP also works to reduce and eliminate contaminants in country foods.
Hunting Restrictions
Regulatory hunting legislation is another factor impeding access to traditional food. As a means of protecting animals threatened by climate change, the federal government has imposed limits on hunting. The Firearms Act (1995) imposes legal requirements on firearm registration and the obtaining of licenses that, while meant to ensure safety among other factors, also increases the cost and time associated with hunting traditional food sources. The Species at Risk Act (2002) restricts the number and type of animals hunted, and the time of year of hunts. Some policy documents, such as the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement and the Territorial Lands (Yukon) Act, provide the Inuit with more control over their land and wildlife. However, as the climate continues to warm and become more unpredictable, it is likely that restrictive legislation will become more common, further limiting what foods the Inuit can hunt.
Inuit hunters’ freedom is also restricted by animal rights activism. Most often, activists protest the seal hunt, which they allege to be a cruel practice. (See also Seal Hunt Controversy.) In 1983, Greenpeace and other activists successfully influenced the European Union’s ban on sealskin products made from white coat harp seal pups. While the legislation exempt the Inuit, the reputation of sealskin in general was ruined. In 1984, the average income of a seal hunter in Resolute Bay dropped approximately 98 per cent. The Inuit maintain that seal meat is an essential part of their diet, economy and culture. Contrary to popular opinion, sealers now undergo mandatory training to ensure that hunting practices are humane. Seal meat also has health benefits: it is rich in zinc, iron and various vitamins. Sealskin can be used to make waterproof clothing. Not considered endangered, seals provide diverse value to the Inuit. Angry Inuk (2016), a documentary directed by Alethea Arnaquq-Baril, seeks to highlight Inuit voices and perspectives in the controversial conversation about the seal hunt.
Financial Challenges
In many cases, the high cost of hunting equipment (which is flown in from the South) inhibits hunters’ ability to provide country food for their communities. An all-season hunting outfit can cost about $55,000, which is more than double the average income in Nunavut. While there are some hunting organizations and harvester support programs that offer subsidies, the costs remain high. As a result, many Inuit are discouraged from pursuing hunting as a full-time endeavour.
Alternative healthy options to country food, such as dairy and fresh produce, are similarly expensive because they are flown in. In 2016, the CBC reported that at a grocery store in Iqaluit, a 4-litre jug of milk cost just over $10. While some Inuit use milk from seals and caribou, this is not readily available, and especially not in bulk. In 2017, a Business Insider report found that a Nunavut grocery store charged just over $16 for five ears of corn, and $12 for two heads of broccoli. Since these prices are often outside the budget of most families, the Inuit are limited in how much fresh produce and dairy they can purchase. The 2017 Nunavut Food Price Survey, conducted by the Nunavut Bureau of Statistics, found that people in Nunavut pay about two times more than other Canadians for the same food items.
In 2011, the Canadian government created a subsidy program, Nutrition North Canada, aimed at providing healthy food at a reduced cost. However, a 2017 report by Tracey Galloway, a researcher from the University of Toronto, argues that the program is failing because of a lack of accountability and strict regulations. With certain foods out of their financial reach, the Inuit mainly consume a combination of country food and less expensive non-perishable food from grocery stores.
Promoting Country Food
Despite ongoing challenges to food security, traditional harvesting is still alive in Inuit communities. The 2007–08 Inuit Health Survey states that more than two-thirds of households in Nunavut had an active hunter in the home. Country food remains integral to Inuit identity and overall well-being. When Inuk photographer Barry Pottle asked Inuit why country food was important (as part of a photo essay he created in 2015), they replied: “We need Inuit country food to feel who we are!” “[They are] not just foods we crave, but they are a part of us” and “It’s…good for the spirit, and eating my own country means healing.” These answers demonstrate the ongoing importance of traditional food to Inuit culture and survival.
As a means of protecting those traditions, policy-makers continue to develop strategies for food security. The Nunavut Food Security Coalition, which unites representatives from the Government of Nunavut and four Inuit organizations, seeks to ensure all people in Nunavut “will have access to an adequate supply of safe, culturally preferable, affordable, nutritious food, through a food system that promotes Inuit societal values, self-reliance, and environmental sustainability.” The federal government similarly supports sustainable food in the North and seeks to address both the high costs of food and concerns about contaminants in country food. A variety of non-profit organizations, independent researchers and Inuit organizations — namely Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami — also produce studies on food security, with the goals of improving the well-being of Inuit in Canada.
In recent years, education programs in the North have incorporated traditional food and hunting practices into various curricula. Developed by the Nunavut Department of Education in 2007, Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit: Education Framework for Nunavut Curriculum focuses on the promotion of Inuit values and culture in schools, which includes knowledge about traversing and living off the land. Nunavut Arctic College provides the Piqqusilirivvik Program, a series of courses on topics including hunting and fishing, survival skills and land and water knowledge. The program incorporates Inuit games, language and stories into the course work.
Television and film projects have also made efforts to promote Inuit culture. Niqitsiat (Healthy Food), a cooking show airing on APTN from 2009 to 2018, explored ways to combine traditional and non-traditional food in a healthy way. Hosted by Inuk cook Rebecca Veevee, Niqitsiat showcased Inuit food, such as muskox, caribou, seal and arctic char. Veevee almost always spoke Inuktitut and used an ulu when preparing meals, thereby reinforcing other aspects of Inuit culture on the show. Documentaries such as Angry Inuk (2016) also bring attention to issues of food security and the benefits of the controversial seal hunt to Inuit communities. .

sciencedaily,https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/11/171122151041.htm ,"Aerial drone footage of bowhead whales in Canada's Arctic has revealed that the large mammals molt and use rocks to rub off dead skin.
The footage provides one answer to the mystery of why whales return to Cumberland Sound, Nunavut, every summer, and helps explain some unusual behavior that has been noted historically by Inuit and commercial whalers living and working in the area.
""This was an incidental observation,"" said Sarah Fortune, a PhD student at UBC's Institute for the Oceans and Fisheries and lead author of a new study based on the findings. ""We were there to document their prey and feeding behavior, but we noticed some strange behavior near the shore.""
Fortune and her colleagues -- William Koski, a whale biologist with LGL Limited, and local Inuit hunters and fishers from Pangnirtung -- watched from a boat as the whales turned on their sides and waved their flippers and tails in the air. It was clear the whales weren't there just to feed.
When the researchers sent drones up to record the animals from above, they saw large boulders underwater and realized that the whales were rubbing against rocks to remove dead skin.
""We now know that Cumberland Sound serves as a habitat for feeding and molting,"" said Fortune. ""Very little is known about molting in any of the large whale species.""
The warmer coastal waters of summer might help facilitate molting, Fortune says. Ocean temperatures are expected to rise, and the change could have implications for the timing, duration and energy needed for molting, as well as the whales' diets.
As oceans change, relatively large-bodied, fatty Arctic crustaceans known as zooplankton the preferred prey of bowhead whales could move to new habitats further north while smaller-bodied, temperate species that are lower in energy are likely to dominate the waters. Scientists don't know how whales will adapt to the changing environment.
Fortune hopes to conduct further studies to determine whether bowhead whales molt primarily during summer months, and throughout their range.
Bowhead whales are the longest-living marine mammals on the planet, with lifespans up to 200 years.

Increased mine life and gold production with reduced execution risk showcases a world class project
Post Tax IRR/NPV(5%) of ~28% and C$1.1 Billion(US$860 million)
Assumes a gold price of US$1,600/oz and exchange rate of 1.31:1 (C$:US$)
Webcast February 25, 2021 at 5:30am Pacific Time
All Dollar Figures in CAD unless otherwise Noted
VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Feb. 24, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Sabina Gold & Silver Corp (SBB.T, SGSVF- OTCQX), (“Sabina” or the “Company”) is pleased to announce the results of the Updated Feasibility Study (“UFS” or the “Study”) for the Goose Property (“Goose Property” or “Project”) at its 100%-owned Back River Gold District (“Back River” or the “District”) in Nunavut, Canada.
“After significant work and several new discoveries, we are very pleased to announce the UFS for the Goose Property, the first planned mine on the Back River Gold District,” said Bruce McLeod, President & CEO, “Ongoing work over the last five years has enabled us to significantly advance the Project through many critical de-risking phases. The UFS supersedes the 2015 feasibility study and showcases a gold project with greater capital efficiency, a higher production profile and longer mine life and has also received the required environmental authorizations and social license to commence construction and operations. We have constructed and operated our logistics and supply chain, successfully delivering goods to the mine site overland, reducing a key risk to the project.
We have also continued to demonstrate the robust tenor of the mineralization at Goose by adding 1 million ounces of gold to the mineral reserves as well as significantly increase the total mineral resource estimate. With a million new inferred resources at Llama extension and Nuvuyak at a historic conversion rate of 73% to reserves, and with and all deposits open, we believe we will be mining at Goose long past the 15 year mine life in this study.
The UFS is rigorous and provides a high level of confidence in our project economics through basic and detailed engineering studies. Additionally, we have taken our own experience and that of other companies in the north and made adjustments to the Project scope and execution plan that we believe provide for greater certainty of success. We believe that the Back River Gold District will become a full scale mining camp in Canada. Next, we have already started to focus on refreshing the Project debt process with a view to obtaining financing to make a production decision this year,” he said.
The Company initiated the UFS following the completion of five years of exploration success in adding to the already significant resources within the Goose Property. The Study indicates the Project generates a post-tax internal rate of return (“IRR”) of 27.7% and net present value(5%), (“NPV”) of C$1.1B (US$860M) with a rapid pay back of 2.3 years. Using U$1,800 and a 1.26 exchange rate, the IRR would be 31.3% and NPV would be $1.3B (US$1.1B).
The UFS is based on an initial processing rate of 3,000 tonnes per day (“tpd”), with an expansion to 4,000 tpd at the end of year two. The mine plan envisions average gold production of ~287 koz Au per year for the first 5 years, and ~223 koz Au per year over the 15 year mine life (upon commencement of commercial production) at a cash cost of US$679/oz Au and All In Sustaining Costs (“AISC”) of US$775. Initial capital (“CAPEX”) is estimated at C$610M (US$466 M) with sustaining capital and closure of C$419M (US$320M).
Project Improvements in the UFS
The UFS reflects considerable work done on, and significant changes and advancements made to the Project since the 2015 Initial Project Feasibility Study (“IFS”) including the following:
- An updated gold price of US$1,600/ounce and exchange rate of $C:US$ of 1.31:1.00;
- A 56% improvement on capital efficiency compared to the IFS (NPV/Initial CAPEX);
- Increased CAPEX due to: changes to scope to de-risk the project including;: earlier underground development to access high grade ounces at Umwelt; early stripping at Echo for stockpiling and tailings deposition to eliminate need for Tailings Storage Facility (“TSF”) and an overall 12% cost escalation since IFS. The higher CAPEX provides for lower operational risk and environmental bonding;
- Elimination of over the fence contracts for both the assay lab and oxygen plant at a modest increase to CAPEX also lowers project risk and provides for decreased OPEX of those cost centres;
- An increase in mineral resources of approximately 1M ounces in the Measured & Indicated categories, and 1M ounces in the Inferred category (see press release dated January 20, 2021), resulting in approximately 1M of mineral reserves growth since the IFS;
- The incorporation of new high-grade underground zones at Umwelt earlier into the mine life increasing annual gold production, particularly in the first years of production with peak production of 312 koz Au in year 3;
- Expansion of the Process plant from 3,000 tpd to 4,000 tpd, coming online at the end of year two of production;
- New mining areas added: Echo open pit and underground, Goose Main underground and Llama underground. Also, additional mineral reserves have been added at depth at the Umwelt deposit;
- Rather than constructing a 1.7km long TSF as proposed in the IFS, the Echo open pit will be mined out prior to the commencement of milling operations to enable tailings deposition. This eliminates the most complicated and highest civil capital risk to the Project. After Echo pit, the Umwelt and Llama open pits will be also used for tailings storage;
- Implementation of progressive reclamation throughout operations to further de-risk and streamline the reclamation process;
- Pre-production mining at Echo and Umwelt open pits will make available 2.2 Mt and 372 K oz, in stockpiled material, sorted by grade, sufficient for two years of production prior to commencement of milling operations;
- A more robust power generation plant for better operation, maintenance and heat recovery;
- Underground mining starts earlier and continues to the end of mine life;
- Open Pit versus underground mining is now approximately 53%/47% (tonnes) versus IFS of 72%/28%;
- Optimization of civil works required for water retention structures with more flexibility;
- All environmental authorizations to commence construction and operations have been received; and
- Completion of comprehensive framework agreement on land tenure and Inuit Impact and Benefits Agreement (IIBA), providing greater certainty of surface access rights and Inuit benefits and social license.
On Site Improvements since IFS
- Key earthworks have been substantially completed on site including preparation for commencement of the underground exploration ramp, roads, the all-weather airstrip extension as well as site preparation for the process pad and accommodation complex;
- Project logistics infrastructure constructed including the Marine Laydown Area (“MLA” or “Port”), with three sealifts from both the east and west successfully testing the Project logistics and supply chain from the South;
- Successful construction and operation of a 172km Winter Ice Road (“WIR”) from the Port to the Goose Property, gaining valuable experience in the Project’s key infrastructure;
- Significant infrastructure including fuel tanks, batch plant, construction crushers and construction/mobile equipment mobilized in 2019/2020 with two maintenance shops;
- Basic engineering completed with detailed engineering substantially completed on the process plant and balance of the plant. Additionally, Sabina engaged with an experienced Arctic construction team as part of a constructability and operability review. This level of work significantly de-risks the Project, bringing a high level of certainty to capital and contingency estimates when compared to most feasibility studies; and
- A prominent Original Equipment Manufacturer (“OEM”) has been engaged to complete the process plant equipment design, working towards a fixed price contract with operational performance guarantee.

The UFS was initiated in September, 2020, led by Sacré-Davey Engineering Inc. Other companies providing expertise and support in the preparation of this Technical Report are AMC Mining, Mining Plus, Canenco Consulting Corp., DT Engineers Ltd., Knight Piésold Ltd., and SRK Consulting (Canada) Inc.
A full list of QPs and their areas of expertise is listed at the end of this news release.
All currencies are in Canadian dollars unless otherwise specified. Base case economics are based on a gold price of US$1,600/oz Au and an exchange rate of 1.31:1 (C$:US$)
The Study’s highlights include:
- The Project generates a post-tax IRR of 27.7% and NPV (at 5% discount rate) of $1.1 B;
- The Project generates Life Of Mine (“LOM”) post-tax net cash flow of ~$2.0 B on gross revenues of $7.0 B with a payback period of 2.3 years (from start of operations);
- The mine plan envisions an average gold production of ~287 koz Au per year for the first 5 years, with a peak gold production of 312 koz in year 3 and ~223 koz Au per year over the 15 year mine life (upon commencement of production);
- Approximately half of mine production to come from open pits with underground production scheduled from year 1 to year 15;
- Initial capital estimate of $610 million and LOM sustaining capital and closure costs of $419 million;
- Total LOM cash cost estimate of US$679/oz Au (including third party royalties, refining and transport);
- LOM all-in sustaining cost estimate of US$775/oz Au LOM (including sustaining capital & closure costs);
- A total of 18.7 million tonnes to be milled over 15 years for a total of 3.3M oz Au with a LOM average grade of 6.0 grams per tonne (“g/t”) Au and LOM average metallurgical recoveries of 93.4%;
- Base case assumptions of delivered diesel price of $0.91/L for power generation and $0.95/L for mobile and stationary equipment; and
- Average open pit strip ratio of 10:1 over LOM.
GOOSE PROPERTY – UFS
Economic Assumptions and Sensitivities:
- Discount rate of 5%;
- Costs and prices based on nominal 2020, Q4 Canadian dollar values;
- No application of inflation or other price escalation;
- Values are presented on a 100% ownership basis and do not include financing costs;
- Exclusion of pre-financing costs and sunk costs (i.e., exploration and resource definition costs, engineering, field work and studies costs, environmental baseline study costs, pre-development, etc.), with the exception of applicable sunk costs as allowable tax pools;
- Includes estimated third-party net smelter royalties (including the 1% NSR granted to Kitikmeot Inuit Association (“KIA”)) which average 4.8% over LOM;
- Mineral royalties as required by the Nunavut Mining Regulations have been evaluated as part of the after-tax analysis. This royalty is payable to the federal government and is deductible from income taxes. It is levied on a mine-by-mine basis and is equal to the lesser of 8% of the net value of mine output during a fiscal year, and an escalating rate from 0% to 14% on incremental levels of net value of the mine output during a fiscal year;
- Federal tax rate of 15% and a NT 12% rate were used to calculate income taxes;
- Canadian Exploration Expense (CEE) and Canadian Development Expense (CDE) tax pools were used with appropriate opening balances to calculate income taxes; and
- Specific capital cost class Capital Cost Allowance (“CCA”) rates were applied and used to calculate the appropriate CCA the Company can claim during the entire life of the Project.
Post-tax financial performance is summarized in Table 1.
A sensitivity analysis was conducted on post-tax net IRR and NPV5% for individual parameters, including the gold price, foreign exchange rate, head grade and recovery, operating costs, and capital costs. The results are shown in Tables 2, 3 and 4. The Project proved to be most sensitive to changes in the foreign exchange rate and gold price. The Project showed least sensitivity to operating costs.
Opportunities for further de-risking at Goose and future growth for Sabina on the Back River District
- Pre-production stockpile of 2.2 Mt of mill feed on the ground at commissioning;
- Early bulk sampling prior to commissioning to validate ore sorting opportunities to reduce tailings production and increase head grade;
- Sabina is also in the process of defining a performance guarantee with the Original Equipment Manufacturer for the process plant;
- High confidence in conversion of further resources into reserves at all deposits with a historical 73% conversion rate. Llama Extension and Nuvuyak deposits are currently inferred resources with a strong probability of effective conversion to reserves;
- Effective access and potential delineation of additional high-grade material from a planned exploration decline at Umwelt UG;
- All deposits in the UFS are open to depth with both new resources at Llama Extension and Nuvuyak showing significant expansion potential along trend.
- With detailed engineering near completion, Sabina is well positioned to engage an experienced Arctic construction team to negotiate lump sum pricing;
- Sabina has invested in site located data collection units and environmental studies on wind energy and has advanced engagement with companies on alternative energy generation for reduced carbon footprint options;
- The exhausted Goose Main open pit is only partially filled with water at the end of the mine life which could allow for additional deposition of tailings, waste rock, contact water or saline ground water to support operations or during upset hydrological conditions (extreme storm events);
- The initial TSF, which is not envisioned as part of the UFS remains fully permitted and may be constructed and used for deposition of tailings, waste rock, contact water or saline ground water;
- Additional time, resources and funds for testing, commissioning, start-up and ramp-up have been incorporated into the economic analysis;
- Expansion and development of the 1 M oz Au each of Indicated and inferred George site resource as a second potential mine; and
- Strong additional discovery potential of new economic gold zones with continued district exploration over the 80km Back River gold belt.
UFS Parameters
The Back River mineral resources are located at the George and Goose Properties. Each site has six gold deposits with the majority of the resources located at the Goose Property. The UFS contemplates only Goose Property. The Goose UFS is based on conventional open pit and underground mining operations that feed a 3,000-4,000 tpd whole-ore leach process plant. The parameters developed for the UFS are shown in Table 5. The plant will produce an average of approximately 223 koz Au per year as doré bullion over a 15 year operating life.
A total of 18.7 million tonnes (“Mt”) will be mined at a mill head grade of 6.0 g/t Au with a projected overall average gold recovery of 93.4%. A total of 3.35 Moz Au is estimated to be recovered over the LOM with cash costs of approximately US$679 per oz Au including royalties. All-in sustaining costs (including sustaining capital and closure costs) are approximately US$775 per oz Au.
For the UFS Parameters see Table 5.
Initially, tailings will be stored in the mined-out Echo Pit, followed by deposition into the exhausted Umwelt and Llama open pits. Mine construction and ongoing operations will be facilitated by an annual sealift during the summer months to Port located at Bathurst Inlet and trucked over a 172 km seasonal WIR to the Goose site in the winter months.
Geology and Mineralization
The Goose Site consists of six main deposits, Llama, Llama Extension, Umwelt, Echo, Nuvuyak, and Goose Main that contain predominantly structurally-controlled gold mineralization which is largely stratabound, within broad zones of sulphidized iron formation. Four deposits, Llama, Umwelt, Echo and Goose Main contribute to reserves used in the UFS. The Llama Extension and Nuvuyak deposits are maiden resources which have been defined to an inferred classification. Gold mineralization is predominantly hosted within the Lower Iron Formation (“LIF”) and to a much lesser extent, the underlying sediments. The Goose Main, Umwelt, Llama and Nuvuyak deposits are associated with anticlinal structures that have been structurally thickened, disrupted, and cut by axial-plane parallel felsic dykes which apparently trace the fluid pathways and are related to mineralization. The Echo deposit is associated with a secondary open folding of an iron formation fold limb and a cross-cutting felsic dyke, while the Llama Extension deposit is hosted in a tightly folded syncline with a diminishing internal anticline plunging in continuation from the Llama Deposit. Mineralization is associated with pyrrhotite within fractures, replacement zones in brecciated host rock, and veins with locally rich arsenopyrite zones and visible gold in areas of quartz veining, shearing, and moderate to strong amphibole and chlorite alteration.
Infrastructure
After completion of the Port at Bathurst Inlet in 2018 and three successful sealifts, in 2019, the Project’s inaugural WIR was constructed, enabling mobilization of all stored equipment and supplies at the Port to the Goose site. During construction and operations, the road will be constructed on a double heading from both the Port and the Goose site over an approximate 8 week period. All items will be trucked from the Port over the 172 km WIR over an approximate 10 week period.
The major infrastructure related to the mining and processing operations at the Goose Site includes the process plant buildings, power plant, truck shop, airstrip, administration complex, accommodation complex, Waste Rock Storage Areas (“WRSA”), tailing storage (in exhausted open pits), water management structures (ponds and diversions), and haul roads.
Buildings and facilities at the Goose site would be heated primarily by heat recovered from the power plant.
The accommodation complex will be portable, modular units partially constructed off-site. The construction and mine-site operations phases at the Goose Site would require accommodation for up to approximately 500 workers.
Existing infrastructure at the Goose site includes:
- A 4,500 foot all-weather airstrip;
- A 100-person exploration camp with fuel storage capacity of 1 million litres;
- Completed box cut for underground ramp along with all major pieces of underground equipment for the first year of ramp development;
- A range of heavy equipment for early civil works including haul trucks, dozers, excavators, blasthole drills and crushing and screening plant;
- Substantially completed permanent fuel storage pads, accommodation complex pad and process plant pad; and
- Approximately 4 km of all-weather roads connecting the camp, the underground portal workshop/collar area, the underground water settling pond, the fuel tank pads and the permanent accommodation complex area.
Existing infrastructure at the Port includes:
- A 3,000 foot all-weather airstrip;
- A 40-person camp;
- Port facility capable of handling ocean going barges from the west, and ship lightering barges from the east;
- 39,000 m2 of lay down area for storage of material;
- Over 10M litre fuel storage tank; and
- Various construction and ice road equipment
The Port and Goose site will have bulk fuel storage tanks, laydown yards, diesel power plants, maintenance shops, accommodation complex, water and domestic waste management facilities, and satellite communications.
The Port will support the seasonal staging and trans-shipment of construction and operational freight. Because access to the Property is seasonal, the types and capacities of infrastructure have been designed to store and transport the required yearly quantities of equipment, materials, and supplies.
Power
The UFS includes 100% on-site diesel generated power at Goose and the MLA. A diesel price of $0.91/L for power generation was assumed, including freight costs to deliver to the Port. The estimated power unit cost averages $0.27/kWh excluding capital cost, logistics or operating labour at the Goose site. The average annual fuel consumption for power generation at Goose is estimated to be 32.5 million litres.
Mining
Conventional shovel-and-truck open pits combined with underground mines are projected to provide the process plant feed at an initial rate of 3,000 tpd or 1.1 Mt/a. A plant expansion to 4,000 tpd or 1.46 Mt/a is planned which will be operational at the end of year 2 until mine operations cease at year 15. Annual mine production of ore and waste peaks at 12 Mt/a from the open pits, with a LOM waste to ore strip ratio of 10:1. Ore production from underground mining will peak at 757 kt/a and will supplement the feed from the open pits. In order to optimize the Project cash flow, the run of mine ore is planned to be segregated into high, medium, and low-grade stockpiles located adjacent to the processing plant.
The UFS contemplates mining starting in Year -2. Open pit mining begins with the Echo pit to provide waste rock material for construction and enable the stockpiling of high-grade ore prior to the start of plant processing. Open pit mining would then transition sequentially to the Umwelt, Llama and Goose Main open pits. Prior to the commencement of gold production, preproduction mining allows for placement of 2.2 Mt of ore containing 372koz Au, sufficient for 2 years of process plant operations (from Echo and Umwelt). Mining will continue with high-grade material feeding the mill directly supplemented with stockpile material to ensure the mill is fed at maximum capacity.
Open pit mining will be completed by Year 12 at Goose. Underground ore production will begin in Year 1 at the Umwelt mine and continue through Year 15. The remaining underground deposits will be mined concurrently with Umwelt. Llama underground mining will begin in Year 1, followed by Goose Main and Echo underground operations. Umwelt underground is the longest duration operation starting in year 1 and ending in year 15.
Open pit mining operations will use a fleet comprising shovels, front-end loaders, and haul trucks. This fleet will be supplemented by drills, graders, and track dozers. A 5 m bench height was selected for mining.
Underground mining operations will be carried out using cut-and-fill, drift and fill, and long hole stoping mining methods. Underground mining will use a combination of two-boom jumbos, rock bolters, load-haul-dump (LHD) vehicles, underground trucks and fleet of support vehicles.
Umwelt Underground will be mined at a maximum rate of 1,500 tpd with other underground areas to be mined at 500 tpd.
Metallurgy
The Company completed additional metallurgical testing programs from 2016 to 2020. The additional testing focused on ultrafine grindability, tailings characteristics using composite samples, and variability characterization between and within ore zones. In addition, test programs have been undertaken, assessing mine plan composites for their gravity, leaching, fine grinding, dewatering, and detoxification metallurgical responses. In 2020, the Company undertook a gap analysis, and performed further optimization on the detoxification process, as well as additional variability programs on Umwelt mineralization using the current optimized flowsheet parameters to update the recovery prediction. This testwork validated historical testwork in that the mineral samples collected responded well to gravity concentration and cyanidation and showed a high degree of consistency. The previously developed process flowsheet was used to test the mine plan composites and Umwelt mineralized zones. Other engineering data were also generated, including tailings settling and viscosity, oxygen uptake and detoxification data. The 2020 test results were comparable to the results produced from the historical test programs.
Based on the current and historical test results, a combination of gravity separation and cyanide leach processes is proposed for the Project. The concentrate from the gravity separation circuit will be leached separately.
Testwork results were used to determine the metallurgical recoveries for each of the deposits, as shown in Table 6.
Processing and Recovery
The process plant is designed to use conventional crushing, grinding, gravity concentration, gold leaching by cyanidation, gold adsorption by carbon-in-pulp (“CIP”), and gold recovery from loaded carbon and gravity concentrate to produce gold doré. Cyanide destruction of the tailings will be completed using a sodium metabisulphite process. The overall design philosophy uses proven equipment with a simple and conventional single-line process flow that can be operated and maintained effectively in an arctic environment.
Tailings, Waste Rock, and Saline Water Disposal
The tailings will be deposited into the various pits: first Echo, then Umwelt, and finally Llama. The major portion of the Goose Main pit is also available for tailing storage, although with the reserves as currently estimated it will not be required. Waste rock will be stockpiled in three locations and sufficient non-acid generating and non-metal leaching waste rock is available to progressively establish a 5 m cap for closure. Saline water generated from mining in unfrozen ground will be concentrated to a brine using reverse osmosis before being stored temporarily in a Saline Water Pond and in the Llama pit, and finally the bottom of the Goose Main pit.
Logistics
Mine construction and operations will have equipment and materials (including fuel) transported mainly from east and west coast ports to the MLA at Bathurst Inlet by sealift during the summer months. Equipment and materials will then be hauled to the Goose Site by a winter ice road.
Although of the major part of materials will be transported to the sites overland, people, emergency spares, food and other small items will be transported by aircraft. The Goose site will have a 5,000 ft all weather airstrip (currently 4,500 ft) to accommodate heavy aircraft and the Port has a 3,000 ft strip to ensure light freight and employee movement.
Capital Costs
The initial CAPEX estimate is $610M, as summarized in Table 7.
The CAPEX estimates were prepared using first principles and applying direct project experience. The estimate is based on feasibility-level engineering, quantity estimates, supplier/contractor quotations for equipment and materials, as well as estimated labour rates and productivity factors specific to northern Canadian locations.
The CAPEX estimates include all pre-production mining activities (Year -3 through -1) and are based on Owner-performed mining and purchase of all equipment.
The initial capital cost estimate is based on the execution plans described in this Study. Sunk costs and owner’s reserve were not considered in the initial capital estimate other than as included in tax pools.
The sustaining capital estimate is based on waste development, mining equipment acquisition and rebuilding, and mining infrastructure installations as defined by the mine plan during operations.
Contingency was developed from a risk perspective which ranged from 5% on quoted equipment bids to 25% on highly variable activities such as transportation and logistics.
Operating Cost Estimation (“OPEX”)
The average LOM unit operating cost is estimated at $141/t processed and is summarized in Table 8. The mine will employ a peak total workforce of (onsite and offsite) 580 people including all contract labour.
Mineral Resource Estimate
At the Goose Site, mineral resource estimates for the Llama, Llama Extension, Umwelt, Echo, Nuvuyak and Goose Main deposits are reported. These are re-estimates for the Goose Main and Echo deposits, first estimates of the Llama Extension and Nuvuyak deposits, and an updated estimate for Umwelt incorporating new drilling of the high-grade zones at Vault and V2. With no new significant data since the 2014 estimate, the Llama deposit has not been re-estimated. The Mineral Resource Estimates are summarized in Table 9.
The mineral resource estimates for the George deposits were updated by reporting from new optimized pit shells for the LCP North, and LCP South, Locale 1, Locale 2, Slave and GH, deposits.
Resources for the Back River District total 6.32M ounces (33,452,000 tonnes at 5.88 g/t) in the Measured and Indicated (“M&I”) category and an additional 2.86M ounces (13,794,000 tonnes at 6.44 g/t) in the Inferred category. The results of the estimates summarized in Table 1, are dated December 31, 2020 (see press release January 10, 2021), superseding the previous estimates outlined in the JDS 2015 report (see press release September 14, 2015).
Mineral Resource Estimates are for the full Back River District; however, only deposits at the Goose Property are contemplated for development to Mineral Reserves in this study.
Mineral Reserve Estimate
The mineral reserve estimate for the Project is based on the mineral resource estimate for the Llama, Umwelt, Echo and Goose deposits completed by AMC with an effective date of December 31, 2020.
The mineral reserve totals and categories are tabulated in Table 10.
The reserves were developed by examining each deposit to determine practical mining methods. Cut-off grades (COGs) were then determined based on appropriate mine design criteria and the adopted mining method. The primary methods chosen are shovel-and-truck open pit mining and underground mining using cut-and-fill (CF), drift and fill in narrow mining areas and long hole stoping.
Both the Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve Estimates take into consideration on-site operating costs (e.g., mining, processing, site services, freight, general and administration), geotechnical analysis for both open pit wall angles and underground stope size, metallurgical recoveries, and selling costs. In addition, the reserves incorporate allowances for mining recovery and dilution, and overall economic viability.
Goose Property Community and Social Responsibility
Permitting
Sabina has received all authorizations for construction and commencement of operations at the Goose Property as planned for in the UFS. All mining areas included within the UFS (Llama, Umwelt, Echo and Goose Main) are permitted within Sabina’s existing Goose authorizations and the UFS approach to waste and water management remains in line with the current authorizations. Sabina anticipates some regulatory engagement to ensure management plans and associated requirements align with changed activities planned within the UFS.
In December, 2017, Sabina completed the environmental assessment process which enabled construction and operations at Goose. Early in 2018 Sabina received the Type B water license, allowing it to proceed with pre-development activities, including infrastructure works at the Port as well as earthworks to establish all weather roads between the deposits, camp sites and the mill site. This was followed by receipt of the Type A water license in November 2018, which enables all activities at site including mine construction and operations. In June 2020 Sabina received approval to use the Initial Tailings Storage Facility location with the receipt of a Schedule 2 permit under the Metal and Diamond Mines Effluent Regulation to operate the initial TSF. Although operational improvements have resulted in this 1.7km long TSF not being required during the contemplated UFS mine life, its permitted use does allow Sabina flexibility including additional tailing, waste rock and water capacity for potential future growth. In addition to these key authorizations Sabina holds numerous other renewable approvals from the federal government including Crown Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs Canada land leases (expiry date of 2048), fisheries authorizations from the Department of Fisheries and Oceans Canada (expiry date of 2031), and navigable waters authorizations from Transport Canada (no expiry date). Sabina currently has agreement on the closure security costs of the currently permitted Project (~$43 m). Sabina will complete progressive reclamation throughout operations and anticipates that the closure security costs for the UFS will not exceed the already agreed upon amount although the timing of payments is expected to change.
In mid-2020 various project enhancements were submitted for consideration by interested parties including the Nunavut Planning Commission, Nunavut Impact Review Board, Nunavut Water Board, Kitikmeot Inuit Association, federal and territorial governments. These enhancements included the extension of airstrips, use of additional fresh water, land-based work on the winter ice road, and deeper mining at the Umwelt deposit to access the Vault zone. Sabina has received approval from both Nunavut Planning Commission and Nunavut Impact Review Board and is currently moving through the water license amendment process.
Social License
In April 2018, the Company and the Kitikmeot Inuit Association entered into renewable 20 year benefit and land tenure agreements under a Framework Agreement (“FA”) setting out rights and obligations with respect to surface land access on Inuit owned land on the Goose Project. The FA provides the commercial leases authorizing mine development and operations and includes an Inuit Impact and Benefits Agreement, grants the KIA a 1% net smelter royalty on future production from the proposed mine on the Goose Property along with other obligations required by the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement.
The FA provides the long-term certainty of land tenure required to de-risk, finance, develop and ultimately mine at Back River. This agreement enhances KIA’s and Sabina’s existing relationship of mutual respect, demonstrates that Nunavut is a pro-responsible development/mining region and underscores its “open for business” strategy.
Project Execution and Development
The Project will be self-managed by the Sabina Owner’s team. Engineering will be cost reimbursable, all SMP&EI (structural, mechanical, piping and electrical instrumentation) will be tendered as a fixed price contract with overall site management by Sabina. Sabina will also be performing all earthworks, mining and maintenance. The Project execution plan takes into account Sabina’s substantial northern experience along with select construction proponents; together an execution strategy and schedule has been created. The schedule has been developed to level the work force on site and has been followed back to Project procurement planning and strategy. The Project procurement plan is influenced by the seasonality of transporting freight into the Goose site and therefore a vital component in the overall planning process.
Procurement and staging of equipment, materials, and fuel at the respective east and west-coast ports needs to take place at least 8 to 12 months before anticipated arrival at the Goose Site. The MLA is planned to receive annual sealift materials in the summer open-water period of August thru September. Materials would then be stored and transported on the WIR which will be operational between January and April. Fixed-wing aircraft landing at the Goose Site will be able to support construction and operations activities by delivering passengers, select materials and heavy cargo which were not included on the sealift.
The construction schedule is 24 months long with additional time and money allocated to the mechanical completion, multi- stage detailed commissioning, operational readiness and ramp up phase of the project than previously.
A Technical Report for the Back River UFS will be filed on SEDAR (www.sedar.com) within 45 days of this news release in accordance with National Instrument 43-101. Readers are encouraged to read the technical report once filed, including the qualifications and assumptions on which it is based.

VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Feb. 24, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Sabina Gold & Silver Corp (SBB.T, SGSVF- OTCQX), (“Sabina” or the “Company”) is pleased to announce the results of the Updated Feasibility Study (“UFS” or the “Study”) for the Goose Property (“Goose Property” or “Project”) at its 100%-owned Back River Gold District (“Back River” or the “District”) in Nunavut, Canada.
“After significant work and several new discoveries, we are very pleased to announce the UFS for the Goose Property, the first planned mine on the Back River Gold District,” said Bruce McLeod, President & CEO, “Ongoing work over the last five years has enabled us to significantly advance the Project through many critical de-risking phases. The UFS supersedes the 2015 feasibility study and showcases a gold project with greater capital efficiency, a higher production profile and longer mine life and has also received the required environmental authorizations and social license to commence construction and operations. We have constructed and operated our logistics and supply chain, successfully delivering goods to the mine site overland, reducing a key risk to the project.
We have also continued to demonstrate the robust tenor of the mineralization at Goose by adding 1 million ounces of gold to the mineral reserves as well as significantly increase the total mineral resource estimate. With a million new inferred resources at Llama extension and Nuvuyak at a historic conversion rate of 73% to reserves, and with and all deposits open, we believe we will be mining at Goose long past the 15 year mine life in this study.
The UFS is rigorous and provides a high level of confidence in our project economics through basic and detailed engineering studies. Additionally, we have taken our own experience and that of other companies in the north and made adjustments to the Project scope and execution plan that we believe provide for greater certainty of success. We believe that the Back River Gold District will become a full scale mining camp in Canada. Next, we have already started to focus on refreshing the Project debt process with a view to obtaining financing to make a production decision this year,” he said.
The Company initiated the UFS following the completion of five years of exploration success in adding to the already significant resources within the Goose Property. The Study indicates the Project generates a post-tax internal rate of return (“IRR”) of 27.7% and net present value(5%), (“NPV”) of C$1.1B (US$860M) with a rapid pay back of 2.3 years. Using U$1,800 and a 1.26 exchange rate, the IRR would be 31.3% and NPV would be $1.3B (US$1.1B).
The UFS is based on an initial processing rate of 3,000 tonnes per day (“tpd”), with an expansion to 4,000 tpd at the end of year two. The mine plan envisions average gold production of ~287 koz Au per year for the first 5 years, and ~223 koz Au per year over the 15 year mine life (upon commencement of commercial production) at a cash cost of US$679/oz Au and All In Sustaining Costs (“AISC”) of US$775. Initial capital (“CAPEX”) is estimated at C$610M (US$466 M) with sustaining capital and closure of C$419M (US$320M).
Project Improvements in the UFS
The UFS reflects considerable work done on, and significant changes and advancements made to the Project since the 2015 Initial Project Feasibility Study (“IFS”) including the following:
- An updated gold price of US$1,600/ounce and exchange rate of $C:US$ of 1.31:1.00;
- A 56% improvement on capital efficiency compared to the IFS (NPV/Initial CAPEX);
- Increased CAPEX due to: changes to scope to de-risk the project including;: earlier underground development to access high grade ounces at Umwelt; early stripping at Echo for stockpiling and tailings deposition to eliminate need for Tailings Storage Facility (“TSF”) and an overall 12% cost escalation since IFS. The higher CAPEX provides for lower operational risk and environmental bonding;
- Elimination of over the fence contracts for both the assay lab and oxygen plant at a modest increase to CAPEX also lowers project risk and provides for decreased OPEX of those cost centres;
- An increase in mineral resources of approximately 1M ounces in the Measured & Indicated categories, and 1M ounces in the Inferred category (see press release dated January 20, 2021), resulting in approximately 1M of mineral reserves growth since the IFS;
- The incorporation of new high-grade underground zones at Umwelt earlier into the mine life increasing annual gold production, particularly in the first years of production with peak production of 312 koz Au in year 3;
- Expansion of the Process plant from 3,000 tpd to 4,000 tpd, coming online at the end of year two of production;
- New mining areas added: Echo open pit and underground, Goose Main underground and Llama underground. Also, additional mineral reserves have been added at depth at the Umwelt deposit;
- Rather than constructing a 1.7km long TSF as proposed in the IFS, the Echo open pit will be mined out prior to the commencement of milling operations to enable tailings deposition. This eliminates the most complicated and highest civil capital risk to the Project. After Echo pit, the Umwelt and Llama open pits will be also used for tailings storage;
- Implementation of progressive reclamation throughout operations to further de-risk and streamline the reclamation process;
- Pre-production mining at Echo and Umwelt open pits will make available 2.2 Mt and 372 K oz, in stockpiled material, sorted by grade, sufficient for two years of production prior to commencement of milling operations;
- A more robust power generation plant for better operation, maintenance and heat recovery;
- Underground mining starts earlier and continues to the end of mine life;
- Open Pit versus underground mining is now approximately 53%/47% (tonnes) versus IFS of 72%/28%;
- Optimization of civil works required for water retention structures with more flexibility;
- All environmental authorizations to commence construction and operations have been received; and
- Completion of comprehensive framework agreement on land tenure and Inuit Impact and Benefits Agreement (IIBA), providing greater certainty of surface access rights and Inuit benefits and social license.
On Site Improvements since IFS
- Key earthworks have been substantially completed on site including preparation for commencement of the underground exploration ramp, roads, the all-weather airstrip extension as well as site preparation for the process pad and accommodation complex;
- Project logistics infrastructure constructed including the Marine Laydown Area (“MLA” or “Port”), with three sealifts from both the east and west successfully testing the Project logistics and supply chain from the South;
- Successful construction and operation of a 172km Winter Ice Road (“WIR”) from the Port to the Goose Property, gaining valuable experience in the Project’s key infrastructure;
- Significant infrastructure including fuel tanks, batch plant, construction crushers and construction/mobile equipment mobilized in 2019/2020 with two maintenance shops;
- Basic engineering completed with detailed engineering substantially completed on the process plant and balance of the plant. Additionally, Sabina engaged with an experienced Arctic construction team as part of a constructability and operability review. This level of work significantly de-risks the Project, bringing a high level of certainty to capital and contingency estimates when compared to most feasibility studies; and
- A prominent Original Equipment Manufacturer (“OEM”) has been engaged to complete the process plant equipment design, working towards a fixed price contract with operational performance guarantee.
For a detailed economic comparison between the IFS and UFS please refer to Table 1.

GOOSE PROPERTY – UFS
Economic Assumptions and Sensitivities:
- Discount rate of 5%;
- Costs and prices based on nominal 2020, Q4 Canadian dollar values;
- No application of inflation or other price escalation;
- Values are presented on a 100% ownership basis and do not include financing costs;
- Exclusion of pre-financing costs and sunk costs (i.e., exploration and resource definition costs, engineering, field work and studies costs, environmental baseline study costs, pre-development, etc.), with the exception of applicable sunk costs as allowable tax pools;
- Includes estimated third-party net smelter royalties (including the 1% NSR granted to Kitikmeot Inuit Association (“KIA”)) which average 4.8% over LOM;
- Mineral royalties as required by the Nunavut Mining Regulations have been evaluated as part of the after-tax analysis. This royalty is payable to the federal government and is deductible from income taxes. It is levied on a mine-by-mine basis and is equal to the lesser of 8% of the net value of mine output during a fiscal year, and an escalating rate from 0% to 14% on incremental levels of net value of the mine output during a fiscal year;
- Federal tax rate of 15% and a NT 12% rate were used to calculate income taxes;
- Canadian Exploration Expense (CEE) and Canadian Development Expense (CDE) tax pools were used with appropriate opening balances to calculate income taxes; and
- Specific capital cost class Capital Cost Allowance (“CCA”) rates were applied and used to calculate the appropriate CCA the Company can claim during the entire life of the Project.
Post-tax financial performance is summarized in Table 1.
A sensitivity analysis was conducted on post-tax net IRR and NPV5% for individual parameters, including the gold price, foreign exchange rate, head grade and recovery, operating costs, and capital costs. The results are shown in Tables 2, 3 and 4. The Project proved to be most sensitive to changes in the foreign exchange rate and gold price. The Project showed least sensitivity to operating costs.
Opportunities for further de-risking at Goose and future growth for Sabina on the Back River District
- Pre-production stockpile of 2.2 Mt of mill feed on the ground at commissioning;
- Early bulk sampling prior to commissioning to validate ore sorting opportunities to reduce tailings production and increase head grade;
- Sabina is also in the process of defining a performance guarantee with the Original Equipment Manufacturer for the process plant;
- High confidence in conversion of further resources into reserves at all deposits with a historical 73% conversion rate. Llama Extension and Nuvuyak deposits are currently inferred resources with a strong probability of effective conversion to reserves;
- Effective access and potential delineation of additional high-grade material from a planned exploration decline at Umwelt UG;
- All deposits in the UFS are open to depth with both new resources at Llama Extension and Nuvuyak showing significant expansion potential along trend.
- With detailed engineering near completion, Sabina is well positioned to engage an experienced Arctic construction team to negotiate lump sum pricing;
- Sabina has invested in site located data collection units and environmental studies on wind energy and has advanced engagement with companies on alternative energy generation for reduced carbon footprint options;
- The exhausted Goose Main open pit is only partially filled with water at the end of the mine life which could allow for additional deposition of tailings, waste rock, contact water or saline ground water to support operations or during upset hydrological conditions (extreme storm events);
- The initial TSF, which is not envisioned as part of the UFS remains fully permitted and may be constructed and used for deposition of tailings, waste rock, contact water or saline ground water;
- Additional time, resources and funds for testing, commissioning, start-up and ramp-up have been incorporated into the economic analysis;
- Expansion and development of the 1 M oz Au each of Indicated and inferred George site resource as a second potential mine; and
- Strong additional discovery potential of new economic gold zones with continued district exploration over the 80km Back River gold belt.
UFS Parameters
The Back River mineral resources are located at the George and Goose Properties. Each site has six gold deposits with the majority of the resources located at the Goose Property. The UFS contemplates only Goose Property. The Goose UFS is based on conventional open pit and underground mining operations that feed a 3,000-4,000 tpd whole-ore leach process plant. The parameters developed for the UFS are shown in Table 5. The plant will produce an average of approximately 223 koz Au per year as doré bullion over a 15 year operating life.
A total of 18.7 million tonnes (“Mt”) will be mined at a mill head grade of 6.0 g/t Au with a projected overall average gold recovery of 93.4%. A total of 3.35 Moz Au is estimated to be recovered over the LOM with cash costs of approximately US$679 per oz Au including royalties. All-in sustaining costs (including sustaining capital and closure costs) are approximately US$775 per oz Au.
For the UFS Parameters see Table 5.
Initially, tailings will be stored in the mined-out Echo Pit, followed by deposition into the exhausted Umwelt and Llama open pits. Mine construction and ongoing operations will be facilitated by an annual sealift during the summer months to Port located at Bathurst Inlet and trucked over a 172 km seasonal WIR to the Goose site in the winter months.
Geology and Mineralization
The Goose Site consists of six main deposits, Llama, Llama Extension, Umwelt, Echo, Nuvuyak, and Goose Main that contain predominantly structurally-controlled gold mineralization which is largely stratabound, within broad zones of sulphidized iron formation. Four deposits, Llama, Umwelt, Echo and Goose Main contribute to reserves used in the UFS. The Llama Extension and Nuvuyak deposits are maiden resources which have been defined to an inferred classification. Gold mineralization is predominantly hosted within the Lower Iron Formation (“LIF”) and to a much lesser extent, the underlying sediments. The Goose Main, Umwelt, Llama and Nuvuyak deposits are associated with anticlinal structures that have been structurally thickened, disrupted, and cut by axial-plane parallel felsic dykes which apparently trace the fluid pathways and are related to mineralization. The Echo deposit is associated with a secondary open folding of an iron formation fold limb and a cross-cutting felsic dyke, while the Llama Extension deposit is hosted in a tightly folded syncline with a diminishing internal anticline plunging in continuation from the Llama Deposit. Mineralization is associated with pyrrhotite within fractures, replacement zones in brecciated host rock, and veins with locally rich arsenopyrite zones and visible gold in areas of quartz veining, shearing, and moderate to strong amphibole and chlorite alteration.
Infrastructure
After completion of the Port at Bathurst Inlet in 2018 and three successful sealifts, in 2019, the Project’s inaugural WIR was constructed, enabling mobilization of all stored equipment and supplies at the Port to the Goose site. During construction and operations, the road will be constructed on a double heading from both the Port and the Goose site over an approximate 8 week period. All items will be trucked from the Port over the 172 km WIR over an approximate 10 week period.
The major infrastructure related to the mining and processing operations at the Goose Site includes the process plant buildings, power plant, truck shop, airstrip, administration complex, accommodation complex, Waste Rock Storage Areas (“WRSA”), tailing storage (in exhausted open pits), water management structures (ponds and diversions), and haul roads.
Buildings and facilities at the Goose site would be heated primarily by heat recovered from the power plant.
The accommodation complex will be portable, modular units partially constructed off-site. The construction and mine-site operations phases at the Goose Site would require accommodation for up to approximately 500 workers.
Existing infrastructure at the Goose site includes:
- A 4,500 foot all-weather airstrip;
- A 100-person exploration camp with fuel storage capacity of 1 million litres;
- Completed box cut for underground ramp along with all major pieces of underground equipment for the first year of ramp development;
- A range of heavy equipment for early civil works including haul trucks, dozers, excavators, blasthole drills and crushing and screening plant;
- Substantially completed permanent fuel storage pads, accommodation complex pad and process plant pad; and
- Approximately 4 km of all-weather roads connecting the camp, the underground portal workshop/collar area, the underground water settling pond, the fuel tank pads and the permanent accommodation complex area.
Existing infrastructure at the Port includes:
- A 3,000 foot all-weather airstrip;
- A 40-person camp;
- Port facility capable of handling ocean going barges from the west, and ship lightering barges from the east;
- 39,000 m2 of lay down area for storage of material;
- Over 10M litre fuel storage tank; and
- Various construction and ice road equipment
The Port and Goose site will have bulk fuel storage tanks, laydown yards, diesel power plants, maintenance shops, accommodation complex, water and domestic waste management facilities, and satellite communications.
The Port will support the seasonal staging and trans-shipment of construction and operational freight. Because access to the Property is seasonal, the types and capacities of infrastructure have been designed to store and transport the required yearly quantities of equipment, materials, and supplies.
Power
The UFS includes 100% on-site diesel generated power at Goose and the MLA. A diesel price of $0.91/L for power generation was assumed, including freight costs to deliver to the Port. The estimated power unit cost averages $0.27/kWh excluding capital cost, logistics or operating labour at the Goose site. The average annual fuel consumption for power generation at Goose is estimated to be 32.5 million litres.
Mining
Conventional shovel-and-truck open pits combined with underground mines are projected to provide the process plant feed at an initial rate of 3,000 tpd or 1.1 Mt/a. A plant expansion to 4,000 tpd or 1.46 Mt/a is planned which will be operational at the end of year 2 until mine operations cease at year 15. Annual mine production of ore and waste peaks at 12 Mt/a from the open pits, with a LOM waste to ore strip ratio of 10:1. Ore production from underground mining will peak at 757 kt/a and will supplement the feed from the open pits. In order to optimize the Project cash flow, the run of mine ore is planned to be segregated into high, medium, and low-grade stockpiles located adjacent to the processing plant.
The UFS contemplates mining starting in Year -2. Open pit mining begins with the Echo pit to provide waste rock material for construction and enable the stockpiling of high-grade ore prior to the start of plant processing. Open pit mining would then transition sequentially to the Umwelt, Llama and Goose Main open pits. Prior to the commencement of gold production, preproduction mining allows for placement of 2.2 Mt of ore containing 372koz Au, sufficient for 2 years of process plant operations (from Echo and Umwelt). Mining will continue with high-grade material feeding the mill directly supplemented with stockpile material to ensure the mill is fed at maximum capacity.
Open pit mining will be completed by Year 12 at Goose. Underground ore production will begin in Year 1 at the Umwelt mine and continue through Year 15. The remaining underground deposits will be mined concurrently with Umwelt. Llama underground mining will begin in Year 1, followed by Goose Main and Echo underground operations. Umwelt underground is the longest duration operation starting in year 1 and ending in year 15.
Open pit mining operations will use a fleet comprising shovels, front-end loaders, and haul trucks. This fleet will be supplemented by drills, graders, and track dozers. A 5 m bench height was selected for mining.
Underground mining operations will be carried out using cut-and-fill, drift and fill, and long hole stoping mining methods. Underground mining will use a combination of two-boom jumbos, rock bolters, load-haul-dump (LHD) vehicles, underground trucks and fleet of support vehicles.
Umwelt Underground will be mined at a maximum rate of 1,500 tpd with other underground areas to be mined at 500 tpd.
Metallurgy
The Company completed additional metallurgical testing programs from 2016 to 2020. The additional testing focused on ultrafine grindability, tailings characteristics using composite samples, and variability characterization between and within ore zones. In addition, test programs have been undertaken, assessing mine plan composites for their gravity, leaching, fine grinding, dewatering, and detoxification metallurgical responses. In 2020, the Company undertook a gap analysis, and performed further optimization on the detoxification process, as well as additional variability programs on Umwelt mineralization using the current optimized flowsheet parameters to update the recovery prediction. This testwork validated historical testwork in that the mineral samples collected responded well to gravity concentration and cyanidation and showed a high degree of consistency. The previously developed process flowsheet was used to test the mine plan composites and Umwelt mineralized zones. Other engineering data were also generated, including tailings settling and viscosity, oxygen uptake and detoxification data. The 2020 test results were comparable to the results produced from the historical test programs.
Based on the current and historical test results, a combination of gravity separation and cyanide leach processes is proposed for the Project. The concentrate from the gravity separation circuit will be leached separately.
Testwork results were used to determine the metallurgical recoveries for each of the deposits, as shown in Table 6.
Processing and Recovery
The process plant is designed to use conventional crushing, grinding, gravity concentration, gold leaching by cyanidation, gold adsorption by carbon-in-pulp (“CIP”), and gold recovery from loaded carbon and gravity concentrate to produce gold doré. Cyanide destruction of the tailings will be completed using a sodium metabisulphite process. The overall design philosophy uses proven equipment with a simple and conventional single-line process flow that can be operated and maintained effectively in an arctic environment.
Tailings, Waste Rock, and Saline Water Disposal
The tailings will be deposited into the various pits: first Echo, then Umwelt, and finally Llama. The major portion of the Goose Main pit is also available for tailing storage, although with the reserves as currently estimated it will not be required. Waste rock will be stockpiled in three locations and sufficient non-acid generating and non-metal leaching waste rock is available to progressively establish a 5 m cap for closure. Saline water generated from mining in unfrozen ground will be concentrated to a brine using reverse osmosis before being stored temporarily in a Saline Water Pond and in the Llama pit, and finally the bottom of the Goose Main pit.
Logistics
Mine construction and operations will have equipment and materials (including fuel) transported mainly from east and west coast ports to the MLA at Bathurst Inlet by sealift during the summer months. Equipment and materials will then be hauled to the Goose Site by a winter ice road.
Although of the major part of materials will be transported to the sites overland, people, emergency spares, food and other small items will be transported by aircraft. The Goose site will have a 5,000 ft all weather airstrip (currently 4,500 ft) to accommodate heavy aircraft and the Port has a 3,000 ft strip to ensure light freight and employee movement.
Capital Costs
The initial CAPEX estimate is $610M, as summarized in Table 7.
The CAPEX estimates were prepared using first principles and applying direct project experience. The estimate is based on feasibility-level engineering, quantity estimates, supplier/contractor quotations for equipment and materials, as well as estimated labour rates and productivity factors specific to northern Canadian locations.
The CAPEX estimates include all pre-production mining activities (Year -3 through -1) and are based on Owner-performed mining and purchase of all equipment.
The initial capital cost estimate is based on the execution plans described in this Study. Sunk costs and owner’s reserve were not considered in the initial capital estimate other than as included in tax pools.
The sustaining capital estimate is based on waste development, mining equipment acquisition and rebuilding, and mining infrastructure installations as defined by the mine plan during operations.
Contingency was developed from a risk perspective which ranged from 5% on quoted equipment bids to 25% on highly variable activities such as transportation and logistics.
Operating Cost Estimation (“OPEX”)
The average LOM unit operating cost is estimated at $141/t processed and is summarized in Table 8. The mine will employ a peak total workforce of (onsite and offsite) 580 people including all contract labour.
Mineral Resource Estimate
At the Goose Site, mineral resource estimates for the Llama, Llama Extension, Umwelt, Echo, Nuvuyak and Goose Main deposits are reported. These are re-estimates for the Goose Main and Echo deposits, first estimates of the Llama Extension and Nuvuyak deposits, and an updated estimate for Umwelt incorporating new drilling of the high-grade zones at Vault and V2. With no new significant data since the 2014 estimate, the Llama deposit has not been re-estimated. The Mineral Resource Estimates are summarized in Table 9.
The mineral resource estimates for the George deposits were updated by reporting from new optimized pit shells for the LCP North, and LCP South, Locale 1, Locale 2, Slave and GH, deposits.
Resources for the Back River District total 6.32M ounces (33,452,000 tonnes at 5.88 g/t) in the Measured and Indicated (“M&I”) category and an additional 2.86M ounces (13,794,000 tonnes at 6.44 g/t) in the Inferred category. The results of the estimates summarized in Table 1, are dated December 31, 2020 (see press release January 10, 2021), superseding the previous estimates outlined in the JDS 2015 report (see press release September 14, 2015).
Mineral Resource Estimates are for the full Back River District; however, only deposits at the Goose Property are contemplated for development to Mineral Reserves in this study.
Mineral Reserve Estimate
The mineral reserve estimate for the Project is based on the mineral resource estimate for the Llama, Umwelt, Echo and Goose deposits completed by AMC with an effective date of December 31, 2020.
The mineral reserve totals and categories are tabulated in Table 10.
The reserves were developed by examining each deposit to determine practical mining methods. Cut-off grades (COGs) were then determined based on appropriate mine design criteria and the adopted mining method. The primary methods chosen are shovel-and-truck open pit mining and underground mining using cut-and-fill (CF), drift and fill in narrow mining areas and long hole stoping.
Both the Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve Estimates take into consideration on-site operating costs (e.g., mining, processing, site services, freight, general and administration), geotechnical analysis for both open pit wall angles and underground stope size, metallurgical recoveries, and selling costs. In addition, the reserves incorporate allowances for mining recovery and dilution, and overall economic viability.
Goose Property Community and Social Responsibility
Permitting
Sabina has received all authorizations for construction and commencement of operations at the Goose Property as planned for in the UFS. All mining areas included within the UFS (Llama, Umwelt, Echo and Goose Main) are permitted within Sabina’s existing Goose authorizations and the UFS approach to waste and water management remains in line with the current authorizations. Sabina anticipates some regulatory engagement to ensure management plans and associated requirements align with changed activities planned within the UFS.
In December, 2017, Sabina completed the environmental assessment process which enabled construction and operations at Goose. Early in 2018 Sabina received the Type B water license, allowing it to proceed with pre-development activities, including infrastructure works at the Port as well as earthworks to establish all weather roads between the deposits, camp sites and the mill site. This was followed by receipt of the Type A water license in November 2018, which enables all activities at site including mine construction and operations. In June 2020 Sabina received approval to use the Initial Tailings Storage Facility location with the receipt of a Schedule 2 permit under the Metal and Diamond Mines Effluent Regulation to operate the initial TSF. Although operational improvements have resulted in this 1.7km long TSF not being required during the contemplated UFS mine life, its permitted use does allow Sabina flexibility including additional tailing, waste rock and water capacity for potential future growth. In addition to these key authorizations Sabina holds numerous other renewable approvals from the federal government including Crown Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs Canada land leases (expiry date of 2048), fisheries authorizations from the Department of Fisheries and Oceans Canada (expiry date of 2031), and navigable waters authorizations from Transport Canada (no expiry date). Sabina currently has agreement on the closure security costs of the currently permitted Project (~$43 m). Sabina will complete progressive reclamation throughout operations and anticipates that the closure security costs for the UFS will not exceed the already agreed upon amount although the timing of payments is expected to change.
In mid-2020 various project enhancements were submitted for consideration by interested parties including the Nunavut Planning Commission, Nunavut Impact Review Board, Nunavut Water Board, Kitikmeot Inuit Association, federal and territorial governments. These enhancements included the extension of airstrips, use of additional fresh water, land-based work on the winter ice road, and deeper mining at the Umwelt deposit to access the Vault zone. Sabina has received approval from both Nunavut Planning Commission and Nunavut Impact Review Board and is currently moving through the water license amendment process.
Social License
In April 2018, the Company and the Kitikmeot Inuit Association entered into renewable 20 year benefit and land tenure agreements under a Framework Agreement (“FA”) setting out rights and obligations with respect to surface land access on Inuit owned land on the Goose Project. The FA provides the commercial leases authorizing mine development and operations and includes an Inuit Impact and Benefits Agreement, grants the KIA a 1% net smelter royalty on future production from the proposed mine on the Goose Property along with other obligations required by the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement.
The FA provides the long-term certainty of land tenure required to de-risk, finance, develop and ultimately mine at Back River. This agreement enhances KIA’s and Sabina’s existing relationship of mutual respect, demonstrates that Nunavut is a pro-responsible development/mining region and underscores its “open for business” strategy.
Project Execution and Development
The Project will be self-managed by the Sabina Owner’s team. Engineering will be cost reimbursable, all SMP&EI (structural, mechanical, piping and electrical instrumentation) will be tendered as a fixed price contract with overall site management by Sabina. Sabina will also be performing all earthworks, mining and maintenance. The Project execution plan takes into account Sabina’s substantial northern experience along with select construction proponents; together an execution strategy and schedule has been created. The schedule has been developed to level the work force on site and has been followed back to Project procurement planning and strategy. The Project procurement plan is influenced by the seasonality of transporting freight into the Goose site and therefore a vital component in the overall planning process.
Procurement and staging of equipment, materials, and fuel at the respective east and west-coast ports needs to take place at least 8 to 12 months before anticipated arrival at the Goose Site. The MLA is planned to receive annual sealift materials in the summer open-water period of August thru September. Materials would then be stored and transported on the WIR which will be operational between January and April. Fixed-wing aircraft landing at the Goose Site will be able to support construction and operations activities by delivering passengers, select materials and heavy cargo which were not included on the sealift.
The construction schedule is 24 months long with additional time and money allocated to the mechanical completion, multi- stage detailed commissioning, operational readiness and ramp up phase of the project than previously.
A Technical Report for the Back River UFS will be filed on SEDAR (www.sedar.com) within 45 days of this news release in accordance with National Instrument 43-101. Readers are encouraged to read the technical report once filed, including the qualifications and assumptions on which it is based.
Next Steps

Sabina Gold & Silver Corp.
Sabina Gold & Silver Corp. is well-financed and is an emerging precious metals company with district scale, advanced, high grade gold assets in Nunavut, Canada.
Sabina released a Feasibility Study on its 100% owned Back River Gold Project which presents a project that will product ~223,000 ounces a year for ~15 years with a rapid payback of 2.3 years, with a post tax IRR of ~28% and NPV5% of C$1.1B.
The Project received its final major authorization in June 25, 2020 and is now in receipt of all major permits and authorizations for construction and operations.
In addition to Back River, Sabina also owns a significant silver royalty on Glencore’s Hackett River Project. The silver royalty on Hackett River’s silver production is comprised of 22.5% of the first 190 million ounces produced and 12.5% of all silver produced thereafter.

Government of Canada supports Nunavut's fishing and sealing industries
CanNor invests over $3.2 million in six projects focused on research, marketing, and training in the territory's fishing and sealing industries
IQALUIT, NU, March 25, 2021 /CNW/ - Nunavut's fishing and sealing industries are key economic drivers in the territory, supporting the livelihood of generations of Inuit. These industries are a source of sustainable economic development in Nunavut, providing jobs for Nunavummiut, as well as presenting a significant potential for growth. That is why the Government of Canada has been there to support the industry over the last year.
The Canadian Northern Economic Development Agency (CanNor) has long been a supporter of Nunavut's fishing and sealing industries, recognizing their positive economic impacts in the territory. For over a decade, CanNor has worked with federal departments and partners, including the Government of Nunavut, Inuit organizations, and businesses, to invest in extensive fisheries research, marketing, and professional training.
Federal support for fisheries and sealing in Nunavut provides jobs and opportunities
Today, the Honourable Daniel Vandal, Minister of Northern Affairs, on behalf of the Honourable Mélanie Joly, Minister of Economic Development and Official Languages and Minister responsible for CanNor, met with members of Nunavut's fishing industry, Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated, the Qikiqtani Inuit Association, and the Government of Nunavut. During that meeting, he highlighted investments of over $3.2 million that have been made to support six projects that will continue to grow and diversify Nunavut's economy. This investment builds on CanNor's support to the development of Nunavut's fishing and sealing industries.
These investments support projects that are providing safe work environments for employees on vessels and in plants during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as projects that are helping to examine innovative ways to expand and promote Nunavut's fishing and sealing industries into new markets, support exploratory fisheries (focusing on redfish and char), as well as small scale inshore fisheries exploration in the communities of Arviat, Kinngait, and Sanikiluaq. These investments will bring new jobs and opportunities for Nunavummiut.
By investing in Nunavut's fishing and sealing industries, the Government of Canada is helping position the territory's economy for a strong recovery, while supporting the government's commitment to create over one million jobs across Canada, restoring employment to previous levels.

Peter Ernerk was on the phone from Iqaluit, dealing in facts and figures about Nunavut, when he stopped and said, “Why don't I just send you an e-mail?” And then he stopped again and said, “You know, sometimes I'm amazed. Forty years ago I was living in an igloo. Now I'm sending e-mails.”
Ernerk’s own experiences offer a context for understanding the latest development in the lives of the Inuit of the eastern Canadian Arctic: the birth this April 1 of the territory of Nunavut. Changes have come dizzyingly fast to the people in this stern and lovely world. A century ago, they were living in a stone age, hunting seals and caribou with weapons of rock or bone. Four decades or so ago, they left hunting camps and semi-nomadic lives for settlements with federally funded and administered schools and nursing stations. Now, with the creation of Nunavut, they will govern one-fifth of the Canadian landmass.
“The Inuit have shown themselves to be very adaptable to change,” says Ernerk, Nunavut deputy minister-designate for culture, language, elders and youth. “We've survived in a harsh land. We'll survive this, too. I am very much challenged by events, but very confident of the people's ability.”
The challenges are considerable. Nunavut will be a huge territory: 60 percent of today’s Northwest Territories including most of the Canadian Arctic islands. It is a land of tundra and mountains, of tiny shoreside hamlets and extensive mineral resources, of endlessly bright summers and unequivocally dark winters. The 27,219 people — 85 per cent Inuit and, with 56 per cent under 25 years of age, the youngest population in Canada — are scattered in 28 communities, most vast distances apart.
Nunavut has two facets: the land claim settlement, via the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement Act, and the creation of a new territory, via the Nunavut Act. The land claim settlement — largest in Canada — gives the Inuit ownership of 350,000 square kilometres of land (including subsurface minerals in a carefully selected 10 per cent of that) and compensation from the federal government of $1.148 billion over 14 years (held in a trust with the interest used to finance business, student scholarships and support for hunters).
The Inuit also gain a share of resource royalties, hunting rights and a greater role in managing the land and protecting the environment. In exchange, they signed away future claims to aboriginal rights and title to all remaining lands and water in Nunavut.
The second facet, the territory of Nunavut, is a 1.994-million-square-kilometre severance from the Northwest Territories, which is left with 1.299 million square kilometres. The Nunavut border north of the Prairie provinces more or less follows the treeline and, with some overlap, more or less delineates traditional Inuit, Dene and Cree lands.
Constitutionally, Nunavut has the same territorial powers and responsibilities as the N.W.T. and Yukon. However, the Inuit majority makes it a de facto model of self-government. By contrast, aboriginal groups — Dene, Inuit, Métis and others — will comprise only 48 per cent of N.W.T.’s population after the creation of Nunavut. Through their new government, Nunavut residents will be in charge of education, health, social services, language, culture, housing, justice and other areas. Government departments and agencies will be established throughout the territory to ensure access to services and jobs. Initially, some government services will be contracted back to the N.W.T. until a Nunavut infrastructure is in place. Given Nunavut’s small tax base and the cost of providing government services in the Arctic, it will receive up to 95 per cent of its operating budget from the federal government. Federally, residents will be represented by one member of Parliament and one senator. Municipal-level governments will remain in place.
All adults living in Nunavut will be eligible to vote and run for office — first elections are to be held on February 15. A 19-member elected legislative assembly, including a cabinet, and a single-level territorial court will be the primary institutions. The legislative assembly is expected to operate consensus-style without political parties, like recent N.W.T. legislatures. All members will be independents.
“What will make it different is the personality of the government and how it behaves, and how it does politics,” says John Amagoalik, chairman of the Nunavut Implementation Commission. “In terms of its organization, it’s not that different. It will be the people who will make a difference.”
An example of this occurred at a recent meeting of Nunavut Tunngavik Inc., Nunavut’s land claim administrators. People were seated with others from their respective regions — Baffin, Keewatin, Kitikmeot — and respective organizations. One youth delegate stood up when it was his turn to speak and said: I see you all sitting in your three regional blocks as if you are here to defend the position of your region. I’d like you to switch places with him, and you to move over there, and you over there ... and so on, until everyone was mixed up. When the shuffle was over, he said, “That’s how Nunavut will have to work.”
The earliest paleo-Eskimo cultures in the arctic regions of the western hemisphere date back 4,000 years, when the first of three or four increasingly sophisticated hunting societies moved across Bering Strait to present-day Alaska, northern Canada and Greenland. The Inuit in Canada are descended from the most recent of these societies, the Thule, whose presence dates back 1,000 to 1,200 years.
A strong, egalitarian Inuit society emerged from Thule culture, largely a result of eastward migration. Groups in Alaska and on the western Arctic coast hunted the abundant coastal whale herds, while the smaller social units that migrated east of the Mackenzie delta relied on more readily available and smaller animals — seal, walrus, caribou, muskox. Two general traits came to define the Inuit character: sharing in the hunt to ensure survival of the group and an attitude of patience, acceptance and enduring confidence, best captured as ayurnamat, loosely translated to “oh well, it can’t be helped, better luck next time.”
There were occasional contacts with Europeans — Norsemen a millennium ago, Northwest Passage seekers in Elizabethan times and again in the 19th century, and whalers in the 19th and early 20th centuries. The beginning of this century also brought the triple presence of missionaries, mounties and Hudson's Bay Company traders. Though no treaties were signed, the Canadian government took northern peoples under its jurisdiction with the creation of an Ottawa-based territorial council in 1870, waiting almost a century, until 1966, to create the first elected positions on the council for the people of the eastern Arctic. Indeed, it was only in 1960 that all aboriginal peoples in Canada were accorded the right to vote in federal elections. Canadian Inuit lived generally beyond the influence of southern society until the shift to settlement living in the 1950s and 1960s, when the Canadian government began providing health care, housing and education. Many parents’ desire for their children to learn to read and write in English led to their move from the land into settlements. The launch of the Anik A-1 satellite in 1972 brought television — CBC and Hockey Night in Canada — to the Arctic and played no small role in the precipitous decline in the use of lnuktitut. The demise of the sealskin industry in the 1970s eliminated a traditional occupation for many young men, some of whom turned, despondently, to substance abuse and suicide.
But the incursion of southern culture brought some benefits. Aside from the practical — rifles and outboards, radios and telephones — there were new social and political concepts: almost immediately, calls for an Inuit territory in the eastern Canadian Arctic were heard.
Precedents for Inuit self-determination included the Alaska Native Claims Settlement in 1971 (which awarded 180,000 square kilometres of land and $967 million (US) to Alaskan native peoples), the 1975 James Bay land claim (which established a basis for various institutions of Cree and Inuit self-government, such as school boards and health and social service agencies), the institution of home rule in Greenland in 1979 (by which the Danish government turned over control of domestic affairs to the almost entirely Inuit government of Greenland), and the 1984 lnuvialuit settlement (which gave western Arctic Inuit a portion of their traditional lands, including shares of oil and gas royalties).
About 25 years ago, Ottawa began in earnest a policy of “devolving” responsibility to native communities — passing on the administration of programs. Today, 82 per cent of programs are native-administered with varying degrees of autonomy.
In 1982, a N.W.T. plebiscite saw 56.4 per cent of voters answering yes to the question “Do you think the Northwest Territories should be divided?” The federal government agreed to an eventual division on the condition that all land claims be settled. Politicos such as Amagoalik, who is widely known as the “father of Nunavut” for his 28 years of campaigning and organizing, were unwavering in their quest for a home territory, but they were also patient. There were no strident demands, no demonstrations, no court cases. They used positive arguments only, highlighting their commitment to Canadian unity.
The approach wasn’t necessarily planned, says Amagoalik, but was “just our way of doing things. It was a good way in that it worked. I’ve been doing a lot of travelling in southern Canada, and I find Canadians feel good about Nunavut.”
The Nunavut Agreement is the first step in building a foundation for a healthier community. “We have the means now and we have the responsibility,” says Amagoalik. “We must get down and tackle the problems.”
The problems are manifold: unemployment (averaging 29 per cent), substance-abuse (35 per cent of Nunavut residents have sniffed solvents), suicide (six times the national average). But there is optimism that improvements will come through community-level efforts. “One difference is that we will have control of the government, of the budget, of the priorities,” says Amagoalik. “A lot of efforts in past have failed I think mainly because the people who controlled the money were not part of the aboriginal community it was meant to serve.”
“We need to diversify our economy, create jobs, improve our education system ... We want to create jobs, but at the same time stick to the principles of respect for the land and respect for the environment.”
Nunavut’s economic future is firmly linked to its renewable and non-renewable natural resources mining and petroleum development, commercial fishing and hunting, and eco-tourism. The land and water that once sustained a semi-nomadic society are now expected to sustain the modern Nunavut economy: 80 per cent of the territory's known mineral reserves —copper, lead, zinc, gold and silver — are on lnuit-owned land.
With the creation of Nunavut almost all of the world's 150,000 Inuit now enjoy a degree of self-determination: some 50,000 in Alaska, 55,000 in Greenland, 27,000 in Nunavut and 8,000 in Nunavik, as northern Quebec’s Inuit call their homeland. Nunavut is the latest beacon of hope for other aboriginal peoples, not only in Canada, whose land claims or other negotiations are proceeding at a glacial pace.
Nunavut illustrates that small populations and daunting physical distances are not insurmountable barriers to maintaining a distinct cultural community within Canada. “We are very much a distinct society,” Amagoalik says. “And the Nunavut government will have the responsibility of protecting and preserving that distinct society. Bur we’re not trying to break up Canada. We’re trying to join Canada.” . The truth about polar bears
Depending on whom you ask, the North’s sentinel species is either on the edge of extinction or an environmental success story. An in-depth look at the complicated, contradictory and controversial science behind the sound bites.
-
On the western shore of Hudson Bay, it’s sometimes hard to remember that polar bears are supposed to be going extinct. Every fall, hundreds of bears gather near Churchill, Man., waiting for the bay to freeze so that they can head out onto the ice to hunt for seals. During this period, people in town treat polar bears more like nuisances than a sentinel species whose condition is regarded as the clearest evidence of the coming global climate apocalypse.
If a friend has ever shown you a snapshot of a polar bear, the odds are good that the photo was taken in Churchill. While Churchill is legendarily the Polar Bear Capital of the World, it is also the Polar Bear Tourism Capital of the World. There are 19 polar bear populations on the planet — 13 of them in Canada — and none is as accessible as in Churchill, which draws an estimated 10,000 visitors every year. If you’d like to scratch your itch for bear sighting in Baffin Bay or Tuktoyaktuk, N.W.T., you’ll probably need float planes, ski-touring gear and a solid knowledge of igloo architecture. But in Churchill, all it takes is a whole lot of disposable income. With hotels, ranger stations and perky multilingual guides, the town is entirely geared toward the modern ecotourist. For the modest sum of $11,349 (per person), you can have the “Ultimate Polar Bear Experience”: 10 days in the Tundra Buggy Lodge, essentially an oversized RV parked at the water’s edge.
By mid-November, the Churchill polar bears have not eaten a full meal in four months, and they spend their days conserving energy. They laze about in front of the assembled crowds, walking in circles, licking at the ground and just generally killing time. Tourists jostle one another, hoping for killer photo ops: the cutest cub, the biggest battlescarred male, the particularly curious subadult that rears up on its hind legs and slaps its paws against the windows of the tour bus. Occasionally, a bear wanders right into town to take a swipe at a garbage can or sniff longingly at the odours wafting out of Gypsy’s Bakery.
The tourists come, of course, because polar bears are a dying breed, and they want to check that furry face off their life lists before it’s too late. The environmental movement has never had a higher-profile spokesmodel than Ursus maritimus. Every discussion about global warming has to include a mention of polar bears; every article about the human disregard for nature has to feature a photograph of a sad-looking bear on a tiny speck of ice.
Granted, the population numbers have been startling. Research from 1984 to 2004 showed that the western Hudson Bay population, which includes the Churchill bears, had declined from 1,194 to 935. The trendlines from that study suggested that by 2011, the population would fall to as low as 676.
Fast-forward to today and a new study, which reveals that the current polar bear population of western Hudson Bay is 1,013 animals.
Wait … what? More bears than there were 10 years ago? Nearly double the prediction? “Polar bears are one of the biggest conservation success stories in the world,” says Drikus Gissing, wildlife director for the Government of Nunavut. “There are more bears here now than there were in the recent past.”
“That’s false,” says Kassie Siegel of the Center for Biological Diversity, the international advocacy organization that, in 2008, successfully pushed to have polar bears listed as “threatened” in the United States. “Polar bear populations are in decline. That means individual bears are starving and drowning.”
Polar bears can weigh more than 500 kilograms, they drag seals out of the ocean with their claws, and on occasion they will attack human beings. In short, these animals are not known for their subtlety. And yet a deep dive into the current science behind polar bear population dynamics produces results that are complicated, contradictory and often quite controversial. For the segment of the media that traffics in sound bites, it’s easy to declare that polar bears are on the verge of extinction … or that this is just another example of the climate-change myth. The truth, as usual, lies somewhere in between.
Underlying any story about polar bear populations is the reality that it can be extremely difficult working with polar bears. They can range across international boundaries, over hundreds of kilometres of forbidding ice and frigid open water. They can dig into dens or camouflage themselves on snowfields. And mark-recapture studies, in which bears are tranquilized, are problematic. Drugging bears is dangerous for both the animals and the scientists, and Inuit often object to such invasive interactions, since drugging and physically handling bears stresses the animals and is an affront to traditional ecological practices.
So scientists end up counting bears in many different ways, including incorporating observations by knowledgeable local residents. But population estimates are just that: estimates. Some subpopulations of bears haven’t been counted in decades, if ever. And some are counted more frequently but with slightly different survey areas or methodologies from year to year. The Polar Bear Specialist Group, an international consortium of experts, classifies 10 of the 19 subpopulations as being “data-deficient,” which isn’t exactly conducive to a coherent discussion about how polar bears are faring worldwide.
Despite all this hedging, the numbers still tell a powerful story. It’s just not always clear what that story is. In Davis Strait, between Greenland and Baffin Island, the polar bear population has grown from 900 animals in the late 1970s to around 2,100 today. In Foxe Basin — a portion of northern Hudson Bay — a population that was estimated to be 2,300 in the early 2000s now stands at 2,570. And in specific areas of western Hudson Bay, the most-studied, most-photographed group of bears on Earth seems to have been on a slow but steady increase since in the 1970s.
News like this leaves climate-change deniers crowing from the rooftops. But a closer look reveals that everything may not be quite so sunny. “Some populations appear to be doing OK now, but what’s frightening is what might happen in the very near future,” says wildlife biologist Lily Peacock, who has worked with polar bears for the Government of Nunavut and the U.S. Geological Survey. “All indications are that the future does not look bright.” While population trends might appear stable, she says, “we’re picking up declines in body condition that are really frightening.” Scientists have shown a direct correlation between warm years and skinny bears. Even more distressing, one study predicted that 40 to 73 percent of pregnant females could fail to deliver healthy cubs if ice breakup happens one month earlier than in the 1990s. Polar bears are long-lived animals that reproduce slowly; counting the number of animals that are alive today might not paint an accurate picture.
Take the population in the greater Churchill area, for example, which was analyzed in a 2012 paper entitled Western Hudson Bay Polar Bear Aerial Survey. While the Government of Nunavut, which commissioned the study, was quick to trumpet an increase in polar bear numbers — and call for higher hunting quotas — the University of Minnesota scientists who actually did the work were more judicious. The sea ice in Hudson Bay is now breaking up two to three weeks earlier than it did three decades ago. And since a bear on land is easier to spot from a helicopter than a bear on the ice, catastrophically early ice breakup may have just made the bears more visible. By that logic, a higher count could actually be evidence that the bears are doing worse.
Even more troublesome is the fact that the number of cubs observed in the western Hudson Bay population is dramatically lower than in the past. While adult bears may be fat and savvy enough to survive a few lean years, juvenile bears reach a tipping point quickly. Despite the triumphal notes sounded by the Nunavut government, the study’s authors point out that the scarcity of cubs undercuts the entire hypothesis that “increasing numbers of bears … are the result of overall subpopulation growth.”
While it’s tempting to talk about polar bears as a single-species group, the truth is that the success or failure of a single subpopulation might say very little about the health of another one. “The thing to remember is the vast range of the polar bear and the utter size of the Arctic,” says Geoff York, the Ottawa-based senior program officer for the World Wildlife Fund’s Global Arctic Programme. “Impacts from warming are unfolding at different rates and different time scales.” Polar bears that make their home in James Bay — at the fifty-third parallel north — have experienced ice-free summers for thousands of years. Bears in the High Arctic Archipelago, however, contend with pack ice so thick that it’s often impossible for them to hunt seals. In the southern reaches of the bears’ range, warming could be catastrophic, but higher north, an increase in open water could potentially make hunting easier.
In Davis Strait, for example, both the extent and thickness of the sea ice have been declining dramatically. In theory, this should be trouble for the local bears, which, like polar bears everywhere else, rely on solid sea ice as a hunting platform. Yet this population is an eye-popping 233 percent bigger than it was four decades ago. It’s tempting to simply declare victory and walk away. And yet this new-found abundance is entirely the result of local management practices that originally had nothing to do with bears. Specifically, in 1983, the European Economic Community banned the importation of the hides of whitecoat harp seal pups. In most places, the polar bear diet consists primarily of ringed or bearded seals. But polar bears aren’t picky eaters; when harp seal populations exploded, polar bears gorged. On the other hand, one theory holds that the loss of sea ice could encourage killer whales to move into polar bear habitat, snatching up all the seals and becoming the new dominant marine mammal.
And what about other menu items besides seal meat? During springtime in Wapusk National Park (just outside of Churchill), tens of thousands of lesser snow geese can be found nesting at around the same time polar bears are coming ashore. As ice breakup occurs earlier, the overlap between the bears and birds gets closer in line. While a bear would have to eat the contents of about four dozen nests to equal the caloric equivalent of just one “seal day,” there is a possibility that an occasional egg smorgasbord could help offset the effects of sea ice loss.
As if global warming weren’t enough of a problem, polar bears face a host of other assaults, not the least of which is hunting. By definition, there is no “sustainable” harvest quota for a population already in decline. That seems obvious, right? And yet it also happens to be the wrong answer. When it comes to the science and politics behind hunting, we have to follow polar bears down the rabbit hole once again.
In Canada, hunting rules are determined by individual provinces and territories, so a particularly peripatetic bear in Hudson Bay could wind up being “managed” by Manitoba, Nunavut, Ontario, Quebec and possibly even Newfoundland. Factor in the disparate laws in the other four polar bear nations — the United States, Russia, Greenland and Norway — and you’ve got a recipe for worldwide confusion.
Approximately two-thirds of the world’s polar bears live in Canada, and about 600 are legally hunted here every year. Of that, 86 percent of the hunting occurs in Nunavut. For years, First Nations and Inuit residents of polar bear country have reported increased interaction with bears. More bears are coming into settlements, scavenging garbage, hassling dogs and terrifying residents. But some scientists counter that if bears were doing well, they wouldn’t come around town and, therefore, a greater number of bear encounters is actually evidence of fewer bears.
Inuit and Cree have harvested Hudson Bay’s polar bears for 6,000 years, before climate change was on anybody’s radar. Harvest levels in modern times have ebbed and flowed according to management and political priorities. Between 2004 and today, according to Nunavut’s wildlife director Drikus Gissing, allowable harvest levels in western Hudson Bay dropped from 56 to 38 and then to 16 — a number that was shared between Manitoba and Nunavut and also had to include unplanned “defence kills.” For locals, hunting is important not just for meat, hides and cultural continuity but also as a significant source of income, since some tags are sold to sport hunters for tens of thousands of dollars.
Terry Audla, the president of Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, Canada’s national Inuit organization, says that when it comes to really understanding how healthy the polar bear population is, it makes no sense to pit the feelings and hunches of far-flung conservationists against the direct observations of local people who deal with the bears all the time. As far as overhunting goes, says Audla, “if you’re reliant on something as a source of food, you’re going to make darn sure that you’re keeping that source healthy.” When you live in Resolute Bay, Nunavut, it’s hard to give a lot of weight to a conservation organization in southern California or a worldwide endangered species treaty that is signed in Qatar. “There’s this whole fad down south about the 100-mile local diet,” says Audla, laughing. “Well, we’ve been doing that forever.”
But even local management of hunting is not without pitfalls. While the territorial government in Iqaluit enforces strict rationing laws, hunters in Quebec (where no annual quota is applied) recently killed 90 bears in a single season. As a result, empty-handed hunters in Nunavut felt that their traditional rights were being curtailed. And when you lose the active engagement of the local population, you’re likely to have more polar bears killed rather than fewer. “The Inuit have been respectful of the quota system,” says Gissing. With an annual harvest of around 450 bears in Nunavut, there are only a handful of poaching incidents every year, a far lower percentage than is seen with other biggame species worldwide. But with quotas going down at the same time that locals are seeing more bears than ever, that level of respect is at risk. Mitch Taylor, who spent 21 years as a polar bear biologist for the Government of Nunavut and now teaches at Lakehead University in Thunder Bay, Ont., believes “local hunters are often better informed than managers and sometimes better informed than researchers on polar-bear trends in their area, and when managers request reductions in quota because of concerns that are ill-founded, those hunters are within their rights to address the misconceptions and clarify what populations really are doing.”
And, to add even more complexity, for populations that are stable or rising, an overabundance of bears might lead to competition for food, decreasing the health of the entire population. In situations like this, limited hunting could improve overall health.
Even Geoff York of the World Wildlife Fund — not exactly an organization known for its wanton blood lust — floats the possibility of killing polar bears as a management tool. “This would be a difficult decision for such an iconic species, but it may become a reality as ice loss outstrips predictions in many regions of the Arctic,” he says. “You may have bears at risk of starving during increased open-water periods. The reality is polar bears showing up in places like Churchill, where you might have increased predation of cubs and more bears starving to death, with people watching and cameras clicking.” And pretty much everyone agrees that rich tourists enjoying their morning lattes on deluxe Arctic extravaganzas don’t want to watch polar bears dying.
Sometimes it feels as though the closer you look at polar bears, the harder they are to really see. Each new bit of evidence seems designed to give another spin on the wheel of public opinion. One recent study says that polar bears have been seen swimming as far as 687 kilometres through open water, which certainly sounds like an ominous sign. Then another study suggests that polar bears could be up to 500,000 years older than previously thought, which means they’ve successfully survived multiple warming periods in the past. So that’s a good thing, right? But then you read the study about mysterious hair loss or the one about how polar bear milk has become contaminated with PCBs and mercury, and you get disappointed all over again.
So bear populations are either increasing or declining. Hunting is either an ecological outrage or a perfectly sustainable aboriginal right. On balance, the majority of polar bear scientists agree that even if the current state of things looks shakily stable, the future for bears is poor. Nonetheless, as long as climate change is political, polar bears will be too. And the tone of the discussion can get downright ugly.
Consider Mitch Taylor’s story. He spent more than two decades as a polar bear researcher and manager for the Nunavut government and has published around 50 peer-reviewed papers. That should garner widespread respect. But Taylor has been highly vocal about his belief that polar bears are mostly doing fine, that cub mortality varies from year to year and that the much ballyhooed predictions of extinction by 2050 are “a joke.” He also alleges that a lot of the “exaggerated decline” is just a way to keep certain scientists well funded and to transfer control of the polar bear issue from territorial to federal hands. In response, Taylor’s critics disinvited him from meetings of polar bear specialists that he’d been attending since 1978. They also like to point out that he’s a signatory of the Manhattan Declaration, which questions the very existence of climate change. But amidst all the heated charges and countercharges, it’s hard to argue the fact that few people know polar bears the way Taylor does. And while it might be inconvenient for current political posturing, there’s no denying that certain subpopulations of polar bears are managing to survive, even thrive.
Unlike some endangered species that can be saved by roping off a grove of trees, polar bears live locally and suffer globally. Although some scientists have suggested creating protected refuges in the High Arctic, what’s really important is how much rain forest the Brazilians will burn in the next 50 years and how many Texans will buy SUVs instead of tuning up their 10-speeds. And few of the environmentalists who visit Churchill talk about the thousands of kilometres they flew to get there or whether a tourist town in the middle of nowhere is part of the reason why the sea ice is melting in the first place.
The current scientific consensus places the worldwide polar bear population between 20,000 and 25,000 animals. Prior to the 1973 worldwide restriction on commerical polar bear hunting, that number was dramatically lower, so low that a meeting of polar bear specialists in 1965 concluded that extinction was a real possibility. Some reports even estimated the number of bears as low as 5,000 worldwide. Yet by 1990, Ian Stirling — at the time, the senior research scientist for the Canadian Wildlife Service and a professor of zoology at the University of Alberta; basically, one of the most respected polar bear scientists on the planet — felt comfortable answering the question as to whether polar bears are an endangered species by stating flatly: “They are not.” He went on to say that “the world population of polar bears is certainly greater than 20,000 and could be as high as 40,000 … I am inclined toward the upper end of that range.” Although old studies are sketchy, clearly more polar bears are alive today than there were 50 years ago, an essentially heartening fact that has not managed to pierce the public consciousness.
The percentage of people on Earth — heck, even the percentage of people in Canada — who have ever seen a polar bear amounts to a rounding error down around zero. In that context, it’s hard to understand what extinction really means. The new inability to see an animal that you never had the opportunity to see before? Of course, the polar bear has intrinsic worth beyond its value to humans, but is it really more valuable than the thousand other threatened species whose names you’ve never heard and whose faces you’ve never seen on a magazine cover? The truth is, the polar bear exists in a space that is as much theoretical as it is tangible. Given current climatological trends, it seems likely that the future of the polar bear is bleak … although its current status is almost certainly stronger than the international conversation would have one believe.
But polar bears don’t think in terms of trends — or politics or marketing or even in time periods longer than the interval until their next seal kill. And while the debate rages and the tourists’ cameras fire away, the polar bears themselves will continue to do what they’ve always done: surviving as best they can in whatever conditions the Arctic throws at them. .

Judy Kunnuk Maktar pulls her black tank top down over narrow hips and tosses back the thick, waist-length mane of hair she’s been growing since she was three years old. Then, with the cheeky flourish of Hilary Duff or Alicia Keys — her favourite recording artists — the 11-year-old performs an Inuktitut song and dance she learned in school. There’s barely enough room to contain the fancy footwork in her modest public-housing unit in Pond Inlet, Nunavut, a community of 1,300 across Eclipse Sound from the glacier-encrusted peaks of Sirmilik National Park. After my applause, she offers an encore of giggling gymnastics, bending backward like a supple reed until her hands touch the floor near her feet, three necklaces dangling near her nose. She later presents me with a tissue rose she made for me during recess and a card with my name written over and over in Inuktitut syllabics. She is thrilled to be hosting someone from somewhere else.
Judy’s mother Maina, just coming off a 10-hour retail shift at the Northern Store, grabs a soda from the fridge, sinks into a faded couch and puts her feet up for a few minutes before tackling the dishes in the sink and popping a frozen pizza into the oven for Judy, Michael Angelo, 9, and husband Jacobie, an apprentice electrician who is, at the moment, replenishing his and Maina’s supply of home-rolled cigarettes. Her gaze, a blend of pride and amusement, flits between me and Judy. Jacobie left school in grade 11 to get a job to help his family pay the bills. Since then, he’s been a stock boy, a community-hall supervisor, a recreation co-ordinator, a bylaw officer, and a carpenter and bear monitor at the nearby Mary River iron mine.
Maina and Jacobie work hard and yet seem to have little to show for their exertions. Judy and her brother sleep on mattresses on the floor, and there are blankets on the windows. The kitchen holds tonight’s dinner but not much more. There’s no Nintendo Wii, no rug on the linoleum tile, little adornment save for Christian icons, family photos and some children’s artwork, but the Maktars are generous, and they give thanks before eating.
I ask Judy what she wants to be when she grows up, to which she replies, “A telephone operator.” Her father winces.
“Why do you want to do that?” he asks. “It’s too easy. I would rather you be a lawyer.” His words and this spartan home — like so many spartan northern homes — remind me that even though a decade has passed since Nunavut was born on April 1, 1999, two threads still compete to unravel and mend this place: scarcity and aspiration.
There are not enough senior accountants to audit government spending here, not enough teachers or doctors or Inuktitut-speaking police officers — there never were. Houses are still scarce, and so are fresh vegetables, furniture, university graduates, hardware supplies, fishing quotas, computers and affordable airline tickets. This family and this territory survive one paycheque to the next.
Despite these acute needs, the Nunavut government dreams of making Inuktitut the working language of government by 2020 and has just passed a pair of language laws that legislates its use in the public service, municipal offices, courtrooms, clinics, schools and private businesses. It’s a cultural victory, to be sure, but prohibitively expensive given compliance deadlines, Nunavut’s limited control over government revenues and the insatiable infrastructure demands of a new territory.
But Nunavut has always been stubborn that way. Just as the tundra’s ubiquitous lichen clings to rocks, erodes the surface and grows by micrometres each year, so does Nunavut change: slowly, bewilderingly. Momentum seems impossible in a place where adversity smothers any sign of progress. On the surface, anyway. Look closer, and you’ll find individuals for whom Nunavut has given hope and opportunity, people who inch forward not in spite of scarcity but because they’ve lived with it so long that it’s normal. That’s why little girls in Pond Inlet can sing and dance and become lawyers if they so choose.
Ask residents what’s changed in the 10 years that have passed since Nunavut was created by carving almost two million square kilometres from the Northwest Territories, and you’ll likely get a blank stare. Some say nothing has changed, aside from explosive growth in the capital city of Iqaluit, which has doubled to more than 6,200 residents since 1995. Nunavut Arctic College was on the northern edge of town when I was a newspaper reporter here a dozen years ago. Now there’s a whole neighbourhood behind it with Inuktitut street names that southerners can’t pronounce. Multicoloured mansions overlook the bay, multicultured customers buy fresh parsley at the grocer’s, and homeless men urinate in front of the new Salvation Army shelter every morning because there’s only one bathroom inside.
Inuit have been trying to shape their role within Canada since long before Nunavut was born. Traditional society in the eastern Arctic has been unravelling for 100 years, most dramatically since the 1950s, when Inuit shifted from a self-sustaining nomadic lifestyle to a sedentary, wage-based economy largely controlled by, and beholden to, Ottawa. Inuit have sought ever since to recover their autonomy and become self-sufficient again. They’ve done so with varying degrees of success, led sometimes by people ill-prepared for public office, who were repeatedly returned to power in a cycle of denial that says as much about the electorate as it does about the elected.
Nunavut was supposed to be different: a model mixture of indigenous and public government with transparency and accountability. But a decade after Nunavut adopted its inuksuk flag and stirring motto — Nunavut Sanginivut (“our land, our strength”) — scandal, conflicts of interest, government accounting disasters and social problems persist. Some Nunavummiut have lost patience awaiting the cultural renaissance and say the Northwest Territories was preferable to the Nunavut carousel that turns furiously but goes nowhere. Such doubts would have been heresy 30 years ago when, fuelled by Inuit nationalism, enthusiastic and fiercely proud twentysomething Inuit political activists began the intense discussions and negotiations with Ottawa from which Nunavut eventually emerged.
Jack Anawak was a young man during that heady awakening. A one-time Liberal MP and a father of 14 — 12 of them adopted — he is committed to self-determination for Inuit, and is a bit of a heretic. Nunavut was created before its time, he says: Inuit were uneducated and unprepared in 1999 to run a territorial government. However, he adds, sounding very Buddhist, what’s done is done, and Inuit should focus not on what Nunavut is, but on what it could be.
“We need visionaries and dreamers,” says Anawak. “We need a Department of Imagination in government. Why should we just copy the British parliamentary system? This is Nunavut. We didn’t survive for thousands of years just to copy someone else.” He’s just completed a contract with the Nunavut Employees Union, and aspires, once again, to political office. “A boat in a harbour is safe. That’s what the Nunavut government is now. But that’s not what a boat is for. It has to go out and explore. We need bold, decisive action on issues and there isn’t the leadership to say we are going forward. Nunavut is comprised mostly of young people. They’re more idealistic. When that population gets to be in charge, Inuit nationalism will come back.” We’re sitting in the restaurant of Iqaluit’s Navigator Inn buzzed on caffeine. I ask Anawak the time. Judging by the angle of the sun, he says, it’s just about 3 p.m. As I marvel at his precision, he points to a clock over my left shoulder and laughs softly into his mug. Touché.
We tend to think Inuit such as Anawak have special skills and superhuman endurance. How else could they have survived long, dark winters in the Arctic with only primitive tools and no wood to burn? And how else can they keep this start-up territory afloat? But their power lies in their shared history. Inuit know their fickle land with a kind of intimacy that has all but vanished from southern society. In few other places in Canada do residents feel such a deep sense of ownership, share such a unique past, speak predominantly one aboriginal language and successfully maintain close family ties within a population smaller than Moose Jaw scattered across a land mass the size of Mexico.
But transforming an aboriginal spirit into a modern, effective bureaucracy with jobs for Inuit and service in Inuktitut is tedious and inherently fraught with discouraging trial and error. Add a shortage of health providers, a mounting energy crisis and a global economic meltdown, and you might fear for Nunavut's future. Without nurses, millions of litres of oil and robust commercial investment, Nunavut could not function. It does not even fully control its annual budget: more than 90 percent of its billiondollar operating revenues come straight from Ottawa. The Crown still collects most of Nunavut's resource revenues, and until the right to manage resources is devolved to the territory - likely during the next few decades - Ottawa retains the accruing royalties and taxes.
While leaders look to the future for economic and political independence, residents of Nunavut’s 26 communities — some as small as 150 people — hunt and go to work and play hockey and wonder what climate change will do to their land. Have their lives improved in 10 years? Circumstances vary across three time zones and three regions: Baffin in the east, with half the territory’s population; the central Kivalliq region; and the western Kitikmeot. The cost and logistics of binding such a wide, remote geography naturally fuel an east-west rivalry. Kitikmeot residents feel isolated from, and ignored by, Iqaluit, much like Albertans feel snubbed by Ottawa. But with its western boundary abutting N.W.T. diamond country, companies are scouring the Kitikmeot for more of the same and other minerals too, positioning the region favourably in Nunavut’s economic future. Despite that, says Charlie Lyall, president and CEO of the Inuitowned Kitikmeot Corporation, western Nunavut can’t even get money for training programs, let alone a new trades school like the one set to open in Kivalliq this year.
Rivalries aside, Nunavut and its corresponding land claims have brought political certainty to the region, which pleases Bay Street and has thus attracted an army of prospectors in the past decade. The exploration and mining sector spent $230 million in Nunavut in 2007, and several mines are set to begin shipping iron, gold and perhaps even uranium within a few years. These projects vibrate with longanticipated promises of security and jobs, but some Inuit balk at the potential impact on caribou, sea mammals and fish. “I’ve been trying to send the message that in the area of Mary River, there are migrating narwhals,” says Abraham Kublu, Pond Inlet’s 28-year-old mayor, singling out one of several species that will be affected by Baffinland Iron Mines’ massive Mary River Project, south of his community. “I spent two weeks with two narwhal researchers from McGill University. There were thousands of narwhals.”
And, as with any fledgling jurisdiction, there are signs of both progress and disarray. Last year saw the groundbreaking in Clyde River for Piqqusilirivvik, Nunavut’s new cultural school, which will teach language and survival skills to Inuit and non-Inuit. Retail sales in Nunavut are up, and so are building permits. But Iqaluit’s two-year-old $64 million hospital is still half empty, because government can’t staff the place, and the public service is operating under capacity, with 20 percent of the jobs still vacant. In some departments, job vacancies exceed one-third. Of jobs, at least, there is no scarcity.
With half its 30,000 residents under age 25 (and a birth rate twice the national rate), Nunavut has the country’s youngest population, which is both an asset and a liability: youth have dreams, says Jack Anawak, but they don’t necessarily know how to achieve them. The first order of business, everyone agrees, is getting more kids through school, and on that front, there is modest progress. Slightly more teenagers are graduating from high school now, nearly 30 percent, compared with 25 percent before the creation of the territory. More young people are attending southern colleges and universities, and fewer are smoking. Despair still drives far too many Nunavut youth to suicide, but for those bold enough to snatch a job among manifold opportunities — teacher, outfitter, receptionist, entrepreneur — their inheritance is a territory ripe for a creative make-over; indeed, starving for it. Aside from its youth, Nunavut’s greatest asset might be the absence of obstinate status quo.
“I think the socio-economic conditions of our people are getting better,” says John Amagoalik, an Inuit sage raised in Resolute and now director of lands and resources for the Qikiqtani Inuit Association in Iqaluit. “The younger generation seems to be in a much better position than we were. I notice they are more healthy and staying in school longer.” Amagoalik, known as the “Father of Nunavut” for his work as a negotiator in the 1970s, is now 61, paler and thinner than he was 10 years ago, with a grey ponytail hanging between his shoulder blades.
“Back then, it was very difficult to envision what we were going to experience in 30 or 40 years, but we knew things had to change,” he says. “We had lost control of our land, and we discovered oil companies and mining companies could do what they wanted, with the blessing of the federal government. It was a colonial situation.” Circumstances soon changed. Within one generation, Inuit mapped their homeland and negotiated Canada’s largest ever land claim and a new territory, both of which re-established Inuit traditional rights and decision-making powers. Formally educated at a residential school, Amagoalik used his new-found language and skills to help negotiate his people’s future. Responsibility and prestige must have been equally intoxicating, and youth a definite asset. “We were pretty young but so full of energy back then,” he says. “Most of the time, we were running just on adrenaline.” But even revered statesmen and winners of National Aboriginal Achievement Awards like Amagoalik are not immune to burnout. In 2001, he served six months’ probation after pleading guilty to assault. Police said alcohol was a factor.
Among the artwork and photographs crowding the walls of Leona Aglukkaq’s Legislative Assembly office, a snapshot of her with Jean Chrétien on April 1, 1999, stands out. She is smiling and radiant in a resplendent coat made from siksik (ground squirrel), caribou, wolf and wolverine. Her grin belies a very stressful year.
A centennial baby born in Inuvik, N.W.T., Aglukkaq grew up in Taloyoak, Gjoa Haven and Thom Bay, an outpost camp on the central Arctic’s northern coast. In 1985, she moved to Yellowknife to attend high school, with tentative plans for a career in health care or teaching. But after working as a page for the N.W.T. Legislative Assembly and watching firebrand MLAs such as Nellie Cournoyea and Lynda Sorensen, she discarded conventional “female” professions and entered the public service. Aglukkaq then ran for office in 2004, beating out six men to become MLA for the riding of Nattilik, one of only two women elected to the 19-member legislature. She took on the daunting Finance portfolio first, then Health and Social Services. In September 2008, she resigned her seat to run federally for the Conservatives. She is now MP for Nunavut and the federal Minister of Health.
But let’s rewind to 1998, when she was a 30-year-old acting deputy minister of human resources in the Office of the Interim Commissioner, Nunavut’s bureaucracy-in-waiting. After addressing practical concerns — such as finding office space (the new legislature didn’t open until October 1999), skilled staff (hundreds of them, preferably Inuit), desks, trash cans and computers, and then installing networks and servers — Aglukkaq was expected to prepare briefing documents and budget priorities for incoming MLAs. As Nunavummiut ate cake on April 1, 1999, government staffers were still scouring NorthMart for office supplies. “I took every job skill I’d learned and put them into one task. It was a test of what I know and what I don’t know. It was very stressful,” says Aglukkaq. “At the end of the day, I thought, ‘Something will go terribly wrong. There’s something we missed.’ But no. We’d done enough.”
Today, despite the territory’s perpetual job-creation machine, less than 70 percent of the labour force is working, with a higher representation of Inuit among the unemployed. Other territorial indicators are equally vexing. Violent crime is up 50 percent since 1993, and life expectancy is 10 years below the national average. Since 1999, 267 people here have committed suicide, mostly boys aged 14 to 24 — the equivalent of wiping out my entire university graduating class. A century ago, those young men would have been formidable hunters who found food when everyone was starving. Now, they are killing themselves. But when it comes to other health issues, such as teen pregnancy, fetal alcohol syndrome, lung cancer and diabetes, notes Aglukkaq, Inuit can’t always blame “the system” or a lack of funding for their own bad choices. “Building dependency creates a sick society, she says. “Where did this dependency come from? Why not brush your teeth? Stop smoking? Eat better? It’s complacency, and complacency has grown into dependency.”
Nunavut’s flaws have always been on display, like bleached bones on the tundra, periodically nudged by the wind but never buried. With vast expanses of treeless land and long stretches of unrelenting sunlight, there’s nowhere to hide: not in a small statistical sample where bad news gets amplified; not from police when you’re high and homeless; not from conflict-of-interest guidelines when you’re a politician approving million-dollar construction projects; not from your ex-husband in tiny towns of overcrowded households where nearly everyone is related by birth or marriage.
“You feel as if you’re in a fishbowl, with everyone watching. There’s a lot of pressure,” says Qajaq Robinson, a 31-year-old Crown prosecutor born in Iqaluit and raised in Igloolik by her teacher father and librarian mother. Fluent in Inuktitut, Robinson earned her law degree in 2005 with 10 other Nunavut residents through the Iqaluit-based, University of Victoria-affiliated Akitsiraq Law Program. She also coaches high school basketball and says Inuit pride is on the rise. But pride demands something of the proud: action. “We can’t remain in a bubble. We have to become worldly — do what we do here and also on Wall Street if we have to,” she says. “The survival of Nunavut depends on becoming more grounded and more worldly.”
In Resolute, a tiny smudge on the gravel coast of Cornwallis Island and Canada’s second most northern community (pop. 230), Zipporah Kalluk Aronsen sits on the floor of her kitchen. Next to her is a piece of cardboard, upon which rests a caribou leg, hoof still on, strands of coarse fur clinging to the flesh. “Have you ever spent time with Inuit?” she asks smiling. “This is real Inuit here.” She slices open the bone with an ulu and sucks out the marrow, which she says prevents cancer. The walls swarm with photos — among them, old black-and-whites from the 1950s of Kalluk Aronsen as a child in caribou skins, when people called her Ootoq (“seal sleeping on the ice”).
“We were so proud when we were told that we would have our own Inuit land, with Inuit rights, and our way of living would come back,” says Kalluk Aronsen, a court worker who helps accused people navigate the legal system. “That’s what we were promised. Lots of people probably could not go back on the land, but at least, they could preserve it and remember it.” Remember how to track polar bears and sew skin boots, for instance. Kalluk Aronsen articulates what many
of her generation — and others — fear most in this struggle to modernize: losing that which makes Inuit Inuit. She represents the grounded part Robinson talked about. Her daughter Celina Kalluk, who runs a graphic-design firm in Iqaluit and helped incorporate traditional images into an urban graffiti project there, represents the worldly part.
And if the term refers to your genes, then Kalluk Aronsen’s 14-year-old granddaughter Cassandra is worldly too: the offspring of an Inuit mom and a Jamaican dad who works as a mechanic for the hamlet. Cassandra gives me a tour of Resolute in running shoes and a fleece jacket lazily half zipped against -17°C weather. A trio of pre-teens — Amy Salluviniq, Melissa Idlout and Belinda Oqallak — joins us for a lark. Belinda is chewing something that looks like white plastic, and I ask her what it is. Qaqulaaq, she says, cartilage from a polar bear toe. They tell me they’ve been learning to throat-sing from an elder and take turns proving it. Amy and Melissa grasp each other’s elbows and sway, exchanging ancient, inhuman vibrations until one laughs and loses the game. When they finish, they ask me about West Edmonton Mall and listen, agog, to every detail.
Trendy clothes and indoor swimming pools might be scarce in Resolute — and Pond Inlet too — but cultural traditions and family bonds are not. And perhaps that’s what propels Nunavut forward in the face of diminishing odds, something Robinson calls “collective duty.” Nunavut has a long history of cyclical scarcity. For 40 generations, as the tundra warmed and cooled and the spirits chased away the animals, Inuit have understood that survival depends on decisive action. When food was scarce, groups leaned into the wind to search for caribou, and those too old or weak stayed behind, knowing their souls might soon be reincarnated in promising new flesh: a baby named for a grandmother, the past thrust into the future and the line between them forever blurry. Today, even among naysayers and heretics, there is commitment to move forward together, however slowly and painfully. It begins when someone starts walking.
“People need positive influences. They need role models, words of healing, love, comfort, support,” says Cheryl Akoak, 22. “Once you’re given the proper support, you take baby steps, and they lead to bigger steps, and you stop and look back and say, ‘I can’t believe I’ve gone this far.’”
Ten years ago, Akoak was an 11-year-old cadet parading about in uniform and brimming with pride at events in Cambridge Bay celebrating the creation of the new territory. In the decade that followed, she succumbed to addictions and depression, like so many of her friends, but managed to get healthy and sober with the help of her family. Now, Akoak and I sit beneath a poster that declares “There is hope for the future,” in classroom 22 of Nunavut Arctic College’s Iqaluit campus, where baby steps lead to bigger ones. She is hoping to complete a two-year mental-health diploma, though she has recently taken a break from school to take care of some personal problems. Despite her desire to help others, she has to stop and mend herself. If her struggle and success are any indication, there is hope yet for Nunavut.
But I am skeptical. We’ve talked for hours when I finally ask how she got the purple mark beneath her right eye, because it looks as if someone has punched her. Not so. It’s a scar from an accident seven years ago, when she was struck by an ATV and her eyeglasses cut deep into her cheek. It’s a scar she can’t hide from an event she can’t change, and she tires of explaining it. I tell her it makes her look tough, but like most young women, she’d rather be pretty.
We make assumptions based on what we see, and Nunavut is no exception. The cold, the darkness, the scars are all distractions from Nunavut’s powerful vitality. One thing’s certain: scars tell you something about the past but nothing of the future. . ",True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False

Nunavut government tables health-focused budget, deficit less than predicted
IQALUIT, Nunavut — The Nunavut government says its finances aren't as bad as it originally predicted despite spending made necessary by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Nunavut tabled a $2.4-billion budget Tuesday that focuses on adding health-care services in the territory. The figure includes $4.8 million for the creation of a Pandemic Response Secretariat.
The secretariat, which adds 30 new positions to Nunavut's public sector, is to manage services addressing the COVID-19 crisis.
Last year, Finance Minister George Hickes projected Nunavut's deficit would be the largest yet — higher than $30 million.
But the 2020-2021 deficit sits at $21 million, in part because federal funding was provided to help deal with the pandemic. Hickes predicts next year's deficit to be even lower at $14 million.
""Had we not received this federal support, I would be reporting a significantly different fiscal situation today,"" Hickes said.
The federal money includes $130 million for COVID-19-relief and $58 million to cover medical travel costs for Nunavut residents.
Last year, Nunavut spent $64.2 million on isolation hubs for Nunavummiut returning to the territory. Quarantining at the hubs is mandatory and has been in place since the pandemic hit last March. Another $30 million was spent last year to put up construction workers in the isolation hubs before they flew up to Nunavut for projects.
Nunavut also spent $55 million last year to support Canadian North and Calm Air, the territory's airlines, from April to September.
The 2021-2022 budget doesn't dedicate new dollars specifically to COVID-19 relief. Hickes said that's because most of what's needed to support Nunavummiut during the pandemic has already been secured through federal funding.
""A lot of the operational network ... on the COVID response has been created,"" he said.
Hickes also said the territory can't anticipate what future costs related to the pandemic will be.
""We don't know exactly what those costs are. We don't have a timeline. We don't have a finish line,"" he said.
""Some of those moneys have been tapped from the third-party funding, and that's why we're leaving a cushion in case there are any shortfalls.""
That cushion is a $75-million contingency fund, up from $50 million in last year's budget.
The 2021-22 fiscal plan also commits funding for a new bachelor of social work program at Nunavut Arctic College and $1.2 million to pay for a new colorectal cancer screening program in Iqaluit.
""One of the things COVID has enhanced ... (is) that we need to bring more services closer to home and more in-territory care,"" Hickes said.
Hickes said the government's revenues for the next fiscal year are predicted to be almost $2.4 billion.
Members of the legislature are to spend the next few weeks reviewing and voting on whether to approve the budget.

Emma Tranter, The Canadian Press . Sabina Gold & Silver Statement on the Nunavut Impact Review Board's Report Regarding the Back River Gold Project, Nunavut, Canada
VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA--(Marketwired - Jun 16, 2016) - Sabina Gold & Silver Corp. (SBB.TO) (""Sabina"" or the ""Company"") announces that it has received the report (the ""Report"") of the Nunavut Impact Review Board (""NIRB"" or the ""Board"") to the Minister of Indigenous and Northern Affairs (the ""Minister"") in relation to Sabina's proposal (the ""Proposal"") relating to its Back River Gold Project in Nunavut, Canada (the ""Project"").
In its Report, the NIRB recommended to the Minister that the Project not proceed to the licensing and permitting regulatory phase at this time but indicated that the proposal could be reconsidered once more information is provided to address uncertainties regarding effects predictions and mitigation measures, particularly with respect to caribou and climate change.
The Report follows a lengthy regulatory process during which the NIRB reviewed Sabina's Environmental Impact Statement, which ran approximately 15,000 pages and included numerous technical studies and reports. The regulatory process included a six-day public hearing in Cambridge Bay, Nunavut.
During the public hearing, the Project received broad support from the Kitikmeot Inuit Association, Kitikmeot communities and federal and territorial government agencies. In its Report, the NIRB acknowledges the general support for the economic benefits that are expected to accrue to the Kitikmeot region if the Project were to proceed.
""We are studying the Report and reviewing the NIRB's recommendations as we seek to continue to move the Project forward,"" said Bruce McLeod, President and Chief Executive Officer of Sabina. ""The Report is over 300 pages long and it will take some time for us to review and analyze the Report in detail,"" said McLeod. ""We remain confident that the concerns of the Board can be addressed and resolved through further consultation and collaboration with stakeholders.""
""We fully appreciate the central importance of caribou in the North,"" said McLeod. ""Obviously, climate change is a matter that impacts everyone - and Northern Canada is more heavily impacted than other places. These are values and concerns we share. Sabina will be considering these issues carefully as it continues its review of the NIRB report.""
Under the provisions of the Nunavut Land Claim Agreement, the next step in the Project review process is for the Minister to review the NIRB's report. Sabina is reviewing its options, including a request to the Minister to refer the report back to NIRB for further consideration.

The second hand ticked toward midnight. Around the table the atmosphere was tense. High-level representatives from the federal government were wavering. It was the make-or-break moment for a deal that would change the face of Canada.
On that night in July, 1993, the government of Canada still balked at the idea of giving Inuit people their own self-governed land. But with midnight looming it relented, signing an historic agreement that resolved a swath of Inuit land claims and led to the founding--15 years ago--of a new Canadian territory: Nunavut. Today, a generation of school children have never known a Canada without Nunavut.
Earlier this month, Inuit leaders and others gathered in Ottawa to look back at the past 15 years and, more importantly, discuss Nunavut's future. With pressure growing to resolve many outstanding aboriginal treaty issues across Canada, it's worth looking at the Nunavut experience.
We spoke to some of the people who helped Nunavut come into existence about the territory's successes and challenges, and what lies ahead. Paul Quassa is Nunavut's education minister, but 15 years ago he was the Inuit chief negotiator. Terry Audla helped establish the new Nunavut government in 1999. He now heads Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, a national Inuit organization.
For Quassa and Audla, the great strength and success of the Nunavut agreement was giving Inuit control over their land and affairs. ""We have Inuit ministers, making our own legislation that is Nunavut relevant,"" Quassa said.
With this, Inuit created a system that better reflected their culture and traditional values. For example, Audla noted how the Nunavut parliament legislates by consensus, eschewing the adversarial partisan model of Canada's other federal and provincial governments.
Like most aboriginal communities across Canada, Nunavut still faces a host of social and developmental issues: high unemployment and school dropout rates, and one of the highest suicide rates in the world. Walking through a grocery store in Iqaluit we experienced sticker shock at the astronomic food prices. We were warmly welcomed into tiny homes bursting at the rafters with people because of Nunavut's chronic housing shortage.
However, with self-government, Quassa and Audla say Nunavut is better empowered to tackle these challenges than many other aboriginal communities. For example, to engage youth in education and reduce drop-out rates, the territory is using its power to ""Nunavutize"" the school curriculum, incorporating Inuit culture, history and language into education.
With greater governmental control over the land, they believe Nunavut's Inuit people are also better placed than other aboriginal communities to manage natural resources, such as diamonds, ensuring they are developed sustainably and that Inuit communities benefit economically. Nunavut Premier Peter Taptuna told us he holds out great hope that Nunavut's vast mineral resources will bring new opportunities. ""We are on the cusp of economic growth that is projected to outpace much of Canada,"" he predicted.
While Nunavut must lead in addressing its own challenges, the rest of Canada can provide support. Quassa and Audla both drew parallels to the development of the Canadian railway in the 1800s. If ""Arctic sovereignty""--which has become a catchphrase in Canadian politics-- is a national priority today, as Western expansion was back then, they argue it's time to drive new transportation links northward. ""Canada was built by connecting from coast to coast (East to West.) Now we're coast to coast to coast,"" Quassa said.
And Canada needs to live up to the commitments it makes to Nunavut. In an ongoing case, it has taken the federal government to court for breaking a promise to help monitor the territory's economic, social and environmental progress.
Inuit leaders admit their territory is still young, coping with growing pains. There is a long road ahead to address issues like economic opportunity. The years to come will be a lesson for all Canada on the power of self-government to tackle the challenges facing our aboriginal people.
This is the fourth in a four part series on aboriginal people and issues.
Brothers Craig and Marc Kielburger founded a platform for social change that includes the international charity, Free The Children, the social enterprise, Me to We, and the youth empowerment movement, We Day.
MORE ON HUFFPOST: . Written by Farid Sharifi, Senior Specialist, Renewable Energy, WWF-Canada
Diesel fuel has long been the primary source of energy in Arctic communities. In the harsh environs of the Arctic, diesel fuel is, above all else, reliable - an important characteristic in 24-hour darkness and -40°C temperatures. Unfortunately, this reliability has high logistical, financial and environmental costs, hindering the self-sufficiency and independence of northern and remote communities.
A new WWF-Canada report shows that these sacrifices in the name of reliable heat and light may no longer be necessary.
Our research into habitat-friendly renewable energy from solar and wind shows that there is a cost-effective opportunity to reduce reliance on fossil fuels in Nunavut. This is an important first step to supporting energy stability in the north without risk to marine environments.
To date, there are very few renewable energy projects in Nunavut, and in most cases the wind turbines or solar panels that have been installed are not large enough to make a substantial dent in diesel use. Some reports and newspaper articles have suggested that the incredible cold and harsh conditions make Nunavut an unlikely host for more substantial projects, but this isn't the case in Alaska, where large-scale and successful projects face similarly severe conditions.
With Alaska's successes in mind, we are working to catalyze the transition to renewable energy in two Nunavut communities, working with communities, utility companies and governments to demonstrate to all Canadians that habitat-friendly renewable energy is reliable and robust enough to power our future.
In March, Prime Minister Trudeau and President Obama agreed that reducing reliance on diesel fuel in the Arctic was a priority for both Canada and U.S. This was presented as a priority for meeting climate change reduction goals and protecting important marine areas, but it also fits into international Sustainable Development Goal commitments to deliver energy security to people around the world.
Since reliability is a top priority for communities, we need to make sure we're putting the proper technologies in the proper location. To do that we needed to know a bit more about the communities. How much money were they spending on diesel fuel? How old are their generators? What's the energy demand of that community? Is it projected to go up or down in the future? Just how much potential is there for solar and wind energy in each?
To gather all this information, we worked with the Waterloo Institute for Sustainable Energy (WISE), a world-class clean-energy research institute, and looked at the 13 Nunavut communities that were considered to be the most promising for renewable energy based on wind and solar potential, population and anticipated costs. WISE gathered and analyzed data to predict what the use of renewable energy sources in northern community grids could achieve.
Not only did we find good potential for renewable energy generation in Nunavut communities, but we also found that investment in renewables in many communities made good financial sense. In five of the Nunavut communities studied, an initial investment in renewable energy would be paid for by reduced diesel energy costs.
These results were even more positive than we had hoped at the outset to the project.
It's clear there are significant opportunities for renewable energy in Nunavut. Our next steps will be to conduct a more in-depth study of the five identified communities, including a workshop this fall, in order to validate the outcomes with communities and stakeholders and collaboratively identify two communities for installing renewable energy.

To gather all this information, we worked with the Waterloo Institute for Sustainable Energy (WISE), a world-class clean-energy research institute, and looked at the 13 Nunavut communities that were considered to be the most promising for renewable energy based on wind and solar potential, population and anticipated costs. WISE gathered and analyzed data to predict what the use of renewable energy sources in northern community grids could achieve.
Not only did we find good potential for renewable energy generation in Nunavut communities, but we also found that investment in renewables in many communities made good financial sense. In five of the Nunavut communities studied, an initial investment in renewable energy would be paid for by reduced diesel energy costs.
These results were even more positive than we had hoped at the outset to the project.
It's clear there are significant opportunities for renewable energy in Nunavut. Our next steps will be to conduct a more in-depth study of the five identified communities, including a workshop this fall, in order to validate the outcomes with communities and stakeholders and collaboratively identify two communities for installing renewable energy.
Follow HuffPost Canada Blogs on Facebook . Food insecurity in Nunavut needs ""remedial action,"" according to a new report.
Canada's Food Report Card 2016 was released by The Conference Board of Canada on Thursday. It grades the country's regions on their food performance based on five factors: industry prosperity, healthy food and diets, food safety, household food security, and environmental sustainability.
Most of Canada fares relatively well, with Saskatchewan scoring the best marks in most categories, followed by British Columbia and Quebec. Atlantic provinces lag behind their western counterparts overall, but are in much better condition than Nunavut.
""Nunavut is, by far, the most affected region, and needs remedial action,"" the report reads, adding that indigenous communities in general suffer from food insecurity — residents who cannot afford or access nutritious food.
One in four people in the territory experience the problem, meaning they resort to consuming low-quality food or even eating less.
High food prices are a major cause of food insecurity, numbers released by the Nunavut Bureau of Statistics in June 2016 show just how bad the problem is.
At the time, a bag of sugar cost most Canadians $2.69, but was selling for $9.65 in the territory. Grapes were selling in Nunavut for more than $28 a kilogram. And the list goes on.
The problem is bad, and has been for years, but a University of Toronto nutritional sciences professor tells CBC News it can be fixed.
""[It's] really a matter of great urgency that somebody federally move into Nunavut now and start to figure out what kind of resources need to be allocated there to enable people to meet basic needs,"" Valerie Tarasuk said.

The military's remote installation in Resolute Bay will become a hub that can support operations, both defence- and science-oriented, year-round if needed
Article content
RESOLUTE BAY, Nunavut — As Russia continues to boost its military presence in the Arctic, the Canadian Forces is planning to expand its Arctic training centre, turning the remote installation into a hub that can support operations, both defence- and science-oriented, year-round if needed.
Canada opened the centre in 2013, with the military sharing the Resolute Bay facility with Natural Resources Canada (NRC), which uses the site for polar research. The centre was originally a NRC facility that was expanded to house and support 120 soldiers. Training exercises, such as the recently finished Arctic Ram, are held in the winter months.

Canadian Forces to expand Nunavut training centre as Russia plans more bases in the Arctic Back to video
But now the Forces wants to provide more space for equipment and to allow for operations year-round.
“We need to build (on) what we’ve got right now in terms of capacity,” said Lt.-Col. Luc St-Denis, who co-ordinates training at the centre. “January to April is a small season. There is potential for more than that, especially in the springtime and summertime.”

Other countries are also expanding their presence in the Far North. Russia’s defence ministry recently completed a military base on an island in its territory in the Arctic Ocean. That installation, the second one in the Arctic to be built by the Russians, is designed to operate year-round and house around 150 soldiers. Russia also plans to eventually build 13 airstrips and six smaller bases in its Arctic territories as it looks to exploit minerals, gas and other natural resources in the region.
St-Denis said the Canadian military also wants to develop additional training locations, such as small-arms ranges, in the Resolute Bay area, with the agreement of the local community and the government of Nunavut.
The proposed expansion of the centre would see “more storage, more capacity to get more equipment in, prepositioning more equipment so we don’t spend a fortune on airlift or chartered aircraft,” St-Denis explained. “It is very expensive to bring stuff here.” The centre is currently equipped with trucks and tracked vehicles for over-snow travel.
Exercises in the Arctic can cost five to seven times more than if they were conducted in southern Canada, according to 2013 army planning documents obtained by Postmedia.

St-Denis said incinerators could also be built to dispose of waste and keep the environmental impact on the area to a minimum.

“We support scientific research,” he explained. “We want to do more with that. It is a logistics capability. We’ve got the warehouse and the kit.”
But any expansion could take years because of the short construction season in the region.
It’s also unclear how the new Liberal government will proceed with defence policy in the Arctic.
Under former prime minister Stephen Harper, the Conservative government put much emphasis on expanding the military’s presence in the Far North. It announced a number of projects, although not all have proceeded smoothly. The construction of a new icebreaker hasn’t yet begun, falling behind schedule. So has the construction of a fleet of Arctic/Offshore Patrol Ships. A proposed naval facility at Nanisivik, Nunavut, has been downgraded in scope because of a lack of money. And the purchase of new aircraft to replace the RCAF’s 40-year-old Twin Otter planes used in the Arctic has also been delayed.

But a number of Conservative government initiatives for the Arctic, including the expansion of the Canadian Rangers and the creation of Arctic Response Companies, have proceeded. In addition, it was the Conservatives who developed the Arctic training centre, which opened in August 2013.
The Liberals have promised to put a renewed focus on surveillance and control in the Arctic as well as continue to expand the Canadian Rangers.
The government has also promised to acquire “enhanced icebreakers.” It is unclear whether that would entail a new fleet of icebreakers or the purchase of additional Polar-class icebreakers, instead of the single vessel promised by the Conservative government.
The Liberal government has also said it would focus on northern communities from an economic point of view, promising help with the high cost of living. It will increase the deductions allowed by residents and boost a program to ensure those in the North have access to affordable, healthy food.
In January, Foreign Affairs Minister Stéphane Dion suggested it was time to work with the Russians in areas of common interest such as the Arctic. That stands in stark contrast to the Conservative government, which limited such discussions, even though other nations, including the U.S., continued to have ties with the Russians.
“Canada was speaking to the Russians even during the tough times of the Cold War,” Dion noted. “And now we are not speaking because of the former policy, of the former government. In what way is it helping our interests in the Arctic?” . Collapse of Nunavut ice shelf 'like losing a good friend:' glaciologist
Article content
A team of scientists placed research instruments into the Milne Ice Shelf in Nunavut last July, with plans to return to collect them this summer and study how the stability of the structure had changed.
The COVID-19 pandemic put that trip on hold. Then a week ago, the last remaining intact ice shelf in the Canadian arctic broke apart.

Collapse of Nunavut ice shelf 'like losing a good friend:' glaciologist Back to video
“And so we’ve lost not only the equipment, which is now drifting away in the Arctic Ocean, but also the information that it recorded over the time that it was out,” Carleton University glaciologist Derek Mueller said Friday.
The Canadian Ice Service said the ice shelf on the northwestern edge of Ellesmere Island has shrunk 43 per cent to 106 square kilometres from 187 square kilometres.
The calving event, captured by satellite, was not a surprise, Mueller said.
The ice shelf sits in a fjord sheltered by tall cliffs, so it had not melted as quickly as others.
While it managed to stay together until last week, Mueller said he had observed worsening cracks and rifts since he first started studying the area in 2004.

“It certainly has been changing — there’s no doubt. And, to me, it wasn’t really a question of if this breakup would happen. It was a question of when it would happen,” Mueller said.
“But still it hits home. It’s sort of like losing a good friend in a way.”
The ice shelf collapse also set adrift research into marine organisms, such as sponges and sea anemones, discovered in water pockets within the ice.
“We’re not sure what these consequences are for these animals. And certainly they won’t be where we were studying them, because that piece has drifted away from the shore,” Mueller said.
“If we find these kinds of animals again, I think it will be a stroke of luck.”
At the turn of the 20th century, 8,600 square kilometres of ice stretched along the northern coast of Ellesmere Island. By 2000, it was reduced to 1,000 and now it’s half that, Mueller said.
University of Ottawa glaciologist Luke Copland said in a news release that the temperature has been up to 5 C warmer this summer than the average between 1981 and 2010.
The region has been warming at two to three times the global rate, he added.
“This drastic decline in ice shelves is clearly related to climate change,” Copland said.
“The Milne and other ice shelves in Canada are simply not viable any longer and will disappear in the coming decades.”
Mueller said the ice shelf collapse should be a wake-up call.
“These ice shelves are well out of balance with the climate and I think their demise is inevitable,” he said.
“But, having said that, it’s not too late to make changes to the way we live and our carbon footprint.”
This report by The Canadian Press was first published on August 7, 2020 . Unaffected by climate change, Nunavut polar bears found to exceed ‘co-existence threshold'
The plan leans heavily on Inuit knowledge, which yields population estimates higher than those suggested by western science
Article content
There are too many polar bears in parts of Nunavut and climate change hasn’t yet affected any of them, says a draft management plan from the territorial government that contradicts much of conventional scientific thinking.
The proposed plan — which is to go to public hearings in Iqaluit on Tuesday — says that growing bear numbers are increasingly jeopardizing public safety and it’s time Inuit knowledge drove management policy.

Unaffected by climate change, Nunavut polar bears found to exceed ‘co-existence threshold' Back to video
“Inuit believe there are now so many bears that public safety has become a major concern,” says the document, the result of four years of study and public consultation.
“Public safety concerns, combined with the effects of polar bears on other species, suggest that in many Nunavut communities, the polar bear may have exceeded the co-existence threshold.”
Polar bears killed two Inuit last summer.
The plan leans heavily on Inuit knowledge, which yields population estimates higher than those suggested by western science for almost all of the 13 included bear populations.

Article content
Scientists say only one population of bears is growing; Inuit say there are nine. Environment Canada says four populations are shrinking; Inuit say none are.
The proposed plan downplays one of the scientific community’s main concerns.
“Although there is growing scientific evidence linking the impacts of climate change to reduced body condition of bears and projections of population declines, no declines have currently been attributed to climate change,” it says. “(Inuit knowledge) acknowledges that polar bears are exposed to the effects of climate change, but suggests that they are adaptable.”
Environment Canada’s response says that’s “not in alignment with scientific evidence.” It cites two studies suggesting the opposite.
Andrew Derocher, a University of Alberta polar bear expert, is blunter.
“That’s just plain wrong,” he said. “That’s been documented in many places now — not just linked to body condition but reproductive rates and survival.”
The government of Nunavut declined an interview request.
Its position is strongly supported by the 11 Inuit groups and hunters’ organizations that made submissions.

Article content
“(Inuit knowledge) has not always been sufficiently incorporated by decision-makers,” says a document submitted by Nunavut Tunngavik Inc., the Inuit land-claim organization. “The disconnect between the sentiment in certain scientific communities and (Inuit knowledge) has been pronounced.”
Pond Inlet wants to be able to kill any bear within a kilometre of the community without the animal being considered part of the town’s quota. Rankin Inlet simply wants to lower bear populations.
In its submission, the Kitikmeot Regional Wildlife Board expresses frustration with how polar bears are used as an icon in the fight against climate change.
If the stated goal is to have fewer polar bears, that may be the tripping point whereby polar bear management in Canada comes under renewed scrutiny
“This is very frustrating for Inuit to watch … We do not have resources to touch bases with movie actors, singers and songwriters who often narrate and provide these messages,” it says.
“We know what we are doing and western science and modelling has become too dominant.”
The management plan doesn’t propose to increase hunting quotas immediately. It contains provisions for increased education and programs on bear safety for hunters and communities.

Article content
It does say hunting bans would no longer be automatically applied to shrinking populations and that “management objectives … could include managing polar bears for a decrease.”
Derocher doesn’t dispute potentially dangerous bear-human encounters are becoming more frequent. But he, and other southern scientists, insist that’s happening as climate change reduces sea ice and drives bears inland.
“They will move into communities seeking food. There’s lots of attractants around northern communities.”
Places where attacks have occurred are not areas with the highest bear densities, he said.
The plan reflects Nunavut’s desire to control its own wildlife resources, Derocher suggested.
“They don’t ask for input from southern scientists. The less input from the south is where it seems to be moving.”
Derocher said the Inuit’s ability to export polar bear hides — or the ability of their hunter clients to take such items home with them — depends on whether the rest of the world trusts the animals are being well-managed.
“If the stated goal is to have fewer polar bears, that may be the tripping point whereby polar bear management in Canada comes under renewed scrutiny.”
Canada has fought off two international attempts to ban the trade of polar bear products.
The territory’s wildlife management board will take what it hears at the public hearings and include it in a final document, which will go before the Nunavut cabinet for approval. . ",True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False

The third-largest island in Canada is one of the remotest places on Earth.
Ellesmere Island is the largest of the Queen Elizabeth Islands in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, and the 10th-largest island in the world. A land of jagged mountains, fjords, and ice shelves, it’s one of the remotest places on Earth, inhabited by herds of musk oxen, caribou, and polar bears.
At 300 miles wide and 500 miles long, Ellesmere Island is the third-largest island in Canada and the most northerly island in the Arctic Archipelago. Ruggedly beautiful and boasting some of the cleanest air on Earth, it also lays claim to the highest mountain in eastern North America (Barbeau Peak) and the largest lake in the polar region (Lake Hazen).
The first known human inhabitants of Ellesmere Island were roaming bands of hunters, such as the Palaeo-Eskimos and Neo-Eskimos, who came to hunt muskox, caribou, and marine mammals around 2000 to 1000 BC. It’s believed that Vikings visited Ellesmere in the 10th century, long before it was sighted by the English explorer William Baffin in 1616.
Today, the human population of Ellesmere Island is about 200. These hardy inhabitants live in three settlements: Alert, Grise Fiord, and Eureka, the latter being the third northernmost settlement in the world. The island’s wildlife, meanwhile, includes small herds of muskoxen, smaller herds of caribou, polar bears, Arctic hares, a wide range of bird species, and 13 species of spider.
More than a fifth of the island is covered by Quttinirpaaq National Park (Quttinirpaaq means “top of the world” in the Inuktitut language). Established in 1988, it’s the second largest park in Canada and the second most northerly park in the world. Only about 50 people visit the park each year, but there is a way to take in some of the views without leaving your own home. In 2017, Google Street View teamed up with Parks Canada, and park staff were trained in the use of the 50-pound Street View Trekker Camera. You can see the 360-degree results here.
On a more sobering note, the breathtaking but fragile environment of Ellesmere Island has proved highly susceptible to the effects of global warming. Around 90 percent of the ice shelves that existed around Ellesmere in 1906 are now gone. This, in turn, has placed the future of polar bears, seals, walruses, caribou and other species under threat of extinction.
Know Before You Go
Being one of the remotest places on Earth understandably makes Ellesmere Island a difficult place to visit, and there are no connecting roads on the island. The Inuit hamlet of Grise Fiord has a small and notoriously tricky air strip, which only the most experienced pilots should approach. Quttinirpaaq National Park is more accessible, but you still need to first fly to Iqaluit, the capital of Nunavut, then fly to Resolute on Cornwallis Island before hiring a Twin Otter to fly to the park. Once you arrive at the park, you're pretty much on your own. You'll find no communities there, or services, just you and the great outdoors.

nationalgeographic,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/canadian-arctic-reserves-to-benefit-wildlife-inuit ,"In Tuvaijuittuq, the ice never melts.
“When you’re there it’s very quiet. It’s so beautiful. When you’re on the ice it feels so solid, like concrete,” says Paul Okalik, the senior adviser for Arctic conservation at the World Wildlife Fund and former premier of the Canadian province Nunavut.
Tuvaijuittuq, he says, “is like no other place on Earth.”
Now the far northern Canadian Arctic region is set to remain pristine thanks to an agreement reached between the Canadian government and Qikiqtani Inuit Assocation (QIA).
“Freezing any new human activities will help ensure the ice that never melts will remain true to its name,” said Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau at a Thursday press conference in the Nunavut city of Iqaluit.
Countries vary in their definitions of what constitutes a Marine Protected Area (MPA). In Canada, the designation closes off water from mining, oil, and gas extraction, dumping, and fishing with a method called trawling. Canada’s MPA standards are new, published this past April after official recommendations were made by a panel of experts.
Environmentalists say guarding this region from industrial activity will be a refuge for walruses, polar bears, seals, and narwhals as the Arctic ice becomes increasingly unstable.
The Canadian government creates MPAs by first placing the selected region under an interim protected period while it finalizes terms of the protected space. In addition to the plan to conserve Tuvaijuittuq, Trudeau also announced the official establishment of the Tallurutiup Imanga National Marine Conservation Area.
Inuit involvement
The QIA want this new marine conservation to be a model of how indigenous groups should be considered, said PJ Akeeagok, the group’s president.
Along with keeping industry out of pristine water, the Canadian government will create jobs in research and data collection, and build critically needed infrastructure like boating docks.
“When the negotiations started, it was in the spirit of reconciliation,” says Akeeagok.
Akeeagok grew up in Grise Fiord, a town where native Inuit groups were forcefully relocated by the Canadian government. By investing in the region’s economy, the government is finally paying the community back for what they have taken, he said.
“Although there’s a dark history in our chapter, our job is to start painting a bright future for Inuit. We want an economy that is self sustaining,” says Akeeagok.
Okalik says having a community that’s bought into the idea of protecting the region will help ensure its regulations are enforced.
“This will support local economies and conservation, which is our goal,” says Okalik. “We’re trying to maintain a viable, conservation-based economy.”
Planning for resilience
Climate change is leading to higher rates of warming in the Arctic than anywhere on Earth, and ice once thought stable is loosening. So much ice has sloughed off that it’s sparked concerns that a new Cold War could be brewing at the top of the Earth, this one over who might control the waters once unpassable for large vessels.
“Inuit are at the front lines of those who see and feel climate change. There’s predictability that is not there anymore, in terms of ice and weather conditions, We hear it directly from hunters,” says Akeeagok.
Both Akeeagok and Okalik are optimistic that official government investment in the natural environment and Inuit people will preserve the region long term.
“I am very encouraged by the progress being made by the government to work with local indigenous populations,” says Okalik. “I hope this is something we will continue because it has been missing in the past.” . ",False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False

Species at a Glance
Arctic char are distributed across the Canadian Arctic Ocean including around the islands of the Arctic Archipelago. While this species may also be found in many rivers and lakes located in Canada’s Far North, the sea-run Arctic char are the most sought after for food and commercial uses.
Arctic char are an important cultural, subsistence and economic resource in the Arctic. There are a number of commercial fisheries taking place in the ocean tidal waters and river waters, as well as many subsistence fisheries for Canada’s Inuit.
Arctic char are a highly priced delicacy, marketed mainly fresh and frozen as whole-dressed fish and steaks. A small quantity is also processed into value–added products including smoked char and jerky.
- Landings:
- Commercial landings were 57 tonnes in 2012 , 52 tonnes in 2011, 29.4 tonnes in 2010 and 31.8 in 2009.
- Value:
- Landed value was $186,000 in 2012, $175,550 in 2011, $118,000 in 2010 and $133,367 in 2009.
- Abundance status and Trends:
- Data is limited given the geographic distribution and nature of the fisheries. However, there are indications that the commercial stocks are stable.
- Fisheries:
- A number of commercial fisheries take place in various river systems throughout the Canadian Arctic, with the majority occurring in Nunavut such as Cumberland Sound and Cambridge Bay areas. There are also exploratory fisheries to examine potential for future commercial char fishing areas.
- Conservation measures:
- Arctic char fisheries in the Canadian Arctic are managed in co-operation with respective co-management partners. Conservation measures for commercial fisheries include minimum gillnet mesh size and total harvest levels.
Species Background
Arctic char have the most northerly distribution of any freshwater fish. This species has a body shape typical of most salmonids and exhibits great variability in form and colouration. In the Cambridge Bay area, for example, spawners have an orange back, sides, and belly, and the intensity of colour is most pronounced in males. Arctic char may be anadromous, moving downstream to the sea in spring and returning in the fall or may remain permanently in freshwater.
Spawning takes place in freshwater in September or October, over gravel beds. Females typically spawn every two to three years. Males arrive first on the spawning grounds to establish and defend their territories. Females arrive later and are courted by the males before proceeding to dig a nest or ‘redd’ in waters between three to six meters deep to deposit their eggs. These eggs incubate under the ice for about six months. Fry emerge from the gravel in mid-July and are about 25 millimeters long.
In most river systems, anadromous Arctic char first migrate to sea when they are four to five years of age and reach a size of 150 to 250 mm. The young char feed mainly on freshwater shrimp and insect larvae, while adults feed on small fish and bottom organisms such as snails, clams and insect larvae. Once at sea, char feed on invertebrates and fishes. In the fall, char return to freshwater to overwinter and escape from freezing in the sea.
Fisheries
Arctic char fisheries are important for the Inuit and in the subsistence economy of many circumpolar people. These fisheries are concentrated near communities and are predominately conducted using gillnets. In 2004, it was estimated that the subsistence harvest in the Cambridge Bay area was about 50 percent the size of the commercial harvest.
The very first commercial fishing effort of Arctic char began in Cambridge Bay (Figure 1) with a gillnet operation in 1960 at Freshwater Creek, which produced a harvest of 2,000 kilograms. A number of fisheries today also take place around Cumberland Sound (Figure 2).
Conservation Measures
The Arctic char fisheries in the Nunavut Settlement Area are co-managed by the Fisheries and Oceans Canada, the Nunavut Wildlife Management Board, Regional Wildlife Organizations, and Hunter and Trapper Organizations, in accordance with the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement, the Fisheries Act and its Regulations, and in some communities, by local Hunter and Trapper Organization bylaws. This ensures that the best available information guides Arctic char fishery management decisions. Integrated Fishery Management Plans are also in development for the main Arctic char commercial fisheries.
Commercial Arctic char fisheries in Nunavut are subject to a range of management measures designed to promote the sustainability and conservation of the char resource. Conservation measures include, but are not limited to, minimum gillnet mesh size, total harvest levels, and community-based monitoring.
The management of these fisheries is complicated by the lack of harvesting data, the widespread distribution, and biological complexity of Arctic char. New approaches using life-history parameters, as well as harvest and habitat information are being developed.
Landings – Historical view:
Commercial landings in the Cambridge Bay region (eight areas) fluctuated from 39,000 kg in 1985 to 22,800 kg in 2003. The Queen Maud Gulf area has averaged about 5,000 kg, while in the Albert Edward Bay area, landings recorded from 1985 to 2003 have reached a high of 17,000 kg.
Population Estimates
DFO scientists, external experts and fish harvesters regularly review Arctic char stock assessments and the results are published on the Canadian Science Advisory Secretariat website. Although these are data-poor stocks, the biological data collected from the fishery indicates a wide range of size and ages are present, with no loss of older age classes. This suggests that current levels of exploitation are likely sustainable.
Information about the condition and status of the oceans is also collected to better understand the effect of environmental conditions on char populations. For example, research activities have assessed: char biodiversity and trophic (feeding) variation in the Canadian North and its role in ecosystem structuring and function; the thermal ecology (temperature histories) of chars and how climate change might affect these; the link between climate change and the bioaccumulation of mercury; and changes in char populations as directly observed through community-based monitoring.

Foreword
The purpose of this Integrated Fisheries Management Plan (IFMP) is to identify the objectives and requirements for the Atlantic walrus (Odobenus rosmarus rosmarus) fishery in the Nunavut Settlement Area, and the management measures that will be used to achieve these objectives. This document also serves to communicate the basic information on the fishery and its management to Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) staff, legislated co-management boards, Hunters and Trappers Associations (HTOs), Regional Wildlife Boards (RWOs), Inuit, communities and other stakeholders. This IFMP provides a common understanding of the basic “rules” for the sustainable management of the fisheries resource.
This IFMP is not a legally binding instrument which can form the basis of a legal challenge. The IFMP can be modified at any time and does not fetter the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans’ discretionary powers set out in the Fisheries Act. The Minister can, for reasons of conservation or for any other valid reasons, modify any provision of the IFMP in accordance with the powers granted pursuant to the Fisheries Act, and subject to the relevant terms of the Nunavut Agreement.
Where DFO is responsible for implementing obligations for any land claims agreements, the IFMP will be implemented in a manner consistent with these obligations. In the event that an IFMP is inconsistent with obligations under land claims agreements, the provisions of the land claims agreements will prevail to the extent of the inconsistency.

1. Overview
The following is an Integrated Fisheries Management Plan (IFMP) that will be used to provide direction in the management of Atlantic walrus (Odobenus rosmarus rosmarus) stocks in the Nunavut Settlement Area (NSA). Walrus in the Areas of Equal Use and Occupancy, as set out in Schedule 40-1 of the Nunavut Agreement (NA), will continue to be managed under applicable Acts, Regulations and land claims agreements, and are currently excluded from the management structure identified within this IFMP.
This IFMP was developed and will be implemented by the Government of Canada and co-management organizations through an adaptive co-management process. Working Groups comprised of Hunters and Trappers Organizations (HTO) from Arctic Bay, Grise Fiord, Hall Beach, Igloolik, Pond Inlet and Resolute, Qikiqtaaluk Wildlife Board (QWB), Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated (NTI), the Nunavut Wildlife Management Board (NWMB) and the Department of Fisheries & Oceans (DFO) were formed to lead the development of the IFMP. The Working Groups have been instrumental in the development of the IFMP.
1.1 History
The walrus is one of the largest members of the seal family with two subspecies recognised. Pacific walrus inhabit the Bering, Chukchi, and Laptev seas. Atlantic walrus inhabit coastal areas of north-eastern Canada, Greenland and Svalbard (NAMMCO 2004).
Walrus have been harvested by Arctic indigenous peoples for thousands of years, providing valuable products such as blubber, bones, tusks and meat. The commercial harvesting of walrus in the 19th and 20th centuries resulted in a rapid decrease of walrus across their Arctic ranges, including the extirpation of the Northwest Atlantic population. By 1928, commercial harvesting of walrus was banned in Canada by the Walrus Protection Regulations. Currently walrus in the NSA are managed under the Marine Mammal Regulations, the Fisheries Act and the NA.
Walrus are a key species in the Arctic marine food web, are of high economic, social and cultural importance for Inuit, and are iconic to Canadians since they are so easily identified with the Arctic environment.
1.2 Type of Fishery and Participants
Atlantic walrus are primarily harvested by Inuit, and are highly valued as a traditional source of food and other products. The Inuit hunt provides an opportunity to maintain cultural traditions and for experienced hunters to pass on their skills and knowledge to younger generations. Walrus products also provide a secondary source of income for hunters. Walrus ivory is either sold raw, or carved into fine art pieces such as jewelry or sculptures. Some communities engage in a small-scale sport hunt conducted by non-Inuit hunters.
1.3 Location of the Fishery
Atlantic walrus are found across most of Nunavut, with the majority of harvests occurring in eastern Nunavut (Figure 1).
1.4 Governance
The walrus fishery in the NSA is co-managed by DFO, the NWMB, RWOs and HTOs, in accordance with the Nunavut Agreement (NA or Agreement), and the Fisheries Act and its regulations. Under this co-management regime, the NWMB is the main instrument of wildlife management in the NSA, but the Minister retains authority and ultimate responsibility for wildlife management and conservation of fish, including marine mammals.
Fisheries Act, regulations, and policies
The walrus fishery is regulated by the Fisheries Act (R.S., 1985, c. F-14) and regulations made pursuant to it, including the Fishery (General) Regulations and the Marine Mammal Regulations. Where there is an inconsistency between the regulations and the Agreement, the Agreement shall prevail to the extent of the inconsistency.
DFO has adopted a Sustainable Fisheries Framework for all Canadian fisheries to ensure that objectives for long-term sustainability, economic prosperity, and improved governance for Canadian fisheries are met. The Sustainable Fisheries Framework contains policies for adopting an ecosystem based approach to fisheries management, including A Fishery Decision-Making Framework Incorporating the Precautionary Approach, and Managing Impacts of Fishing on Benthic Habitat, Communities and Species. This policy framework applies to the walrus fishery in the Nunavut Settlement Area.

Nunavut Agreement
In 1993, Canada settled a comprehensive land claim agreement with the Inuit of the NSA. The NA created priority access and wildlife harvesting rights for Inuit and other Aboriginal groups who traditionally harvested within the NSA.
The NA also created an Institution of Public Government, the NWMB, to share decision making authority with the Federal Government. The NWMB and DFO Minister consider matters relating to the proper management and control of fisheries and the conservation of fish within the NSA. Under this co-management regime, the NWMB is the main instrument of wildlife management, but the Minister retains ultimate responsibility for wildlife management and may accept, reject or vary decisions made by the NWMB with respect to harvesting and other decisions related to the management and protection of wildlife and wildlife habitat.
The NA establishes wildlife management authority for the NWMB including the establishment, modification, and removal of levels of Total Allowable Harvest (TAH) or harvesting in the NSA, as well as Non-Quota Limitations (NQLs) on harvesting such as management units and harvesting seasons. Once a total allowable harvest has been established, the NWMB is also required to strike a Basic Needs Level (BNL), which is the portion of the TAH allocated to Inuit that constitutes the first demand on the TAH. Once established for a stock or population, the TAH replaces the existing regulatory quota.
The NL establishes wildlife management authority for RWOs and HTOs. The powers and functions of the RWOs (NA 5.7.6) include:
- Regulation of harvesting practices and techniques among the members of HTOs in the region, including the use of non-quota limitations.
- Allocation and enforcement of regional basic needs levels and adjusted basic needs levels among HTOs in the region.
- Assignment to any person or body other than an HTO, with or without valuable consideration and conditions, of any portion of regional basic needs levels and adjusted basic needs levels.
- Generally, the management of harvesting among the members of HTOs in the region.
The powers and functions of the HTOs (NA 5.7.3) include:
- Regulation of harvesting practices and techniques among the members, including the use of non-quota limitations.
- Allocation and enforcement of community basic needs levels and adjusted basic needs levels among members.
- Assignment to non-members, with or without valuable consideration and conditions, of any portion of community basic needs levels and adjusted basic needs levels.
- Generally, the management of harvesting among the members.
The NA establishes authority to Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated (NTI) as the primary Designated Inuit Organizations (DIO) under the Agreement. It is responsible for ensuring that Inuit rights and obligations under the land claim are implemented, including the wildlife management provisions (Article 5) of the NA.
Under the NA, wildlife management and Inuit harvesting are guided by the principles of conservation (NA s.5.1.5).

1.5 Fishery Characteristics
In Nunavut, Atlantic walrus are harvested year round. Inuit hunters use a combination of modern equipment, such as snowmobiles, boats with outboard motors, and rifles, as well as traditional sleds, harpoons and floats. Typically, walrus are hunted from boats when they are on ice floes or while they are swimming in open water. In most cases walrus are shot first and then harpooned. Hunters prefer to kill walrus on ice where they are easier to retrieve and process. Animals on the ice are shot from close range with the intention of killing them immediately before they can fall into the water. Loss rates can be high when walrus are killed in deep water because they sink quickly (NAMMCO 2004, COSEWIC 2006). To reduce losses, animals in the water may be harpooned before they are shot, wounded so they can be harpooned before being killed, or killed in shallow water where they can be retrieved with grappling hooks or at low tide (NAMMCO 2004, COSEWIC 2006). Harpooning a walrus is dangerous, since animals must be approached to within 10m and wounded walrus become very aggressive and can capsize canoes or small boats (COSEWIC 2006). Floats made from seal skin are still heavily used, although hunters are finding that modern floats are more durable.
Some communities conduct walrus sport hunts. Individuals hunting under the authority of a marine mammal fishing licence issued by DFO must travel with local guides approved by the HTO. The licence stipulates when and where the hunt is authorized to take place, by whom, their country of origin, quotas, gear type to be used, as well as any specific conditions related to the hunt, such as the reporting of all hunts to the local DFO office, firearm muzzle velocity requirements, and the total number of strikes allowed. Individual HTOs may also have local by-laws. Licenced sport hunters report harvest information directly to DFO. See section 6 and Appendix 3 for more information on walrus sport hunts.

1.6 Approval Process
This IFMP has been approved by the Minister of DFO and the NWMB pursuant to section 5.2.34 of the NA. It will be reviewed and amended as necessary in collaboration with co-management organizations to ensure it remains relevant and current with new science, Traditional Ecological Knowledge and Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit.
This IFMP will be translated to Inuktitut and made available from DFO.
2. Stock Assessment, Science and Traditional Knowledge
2.1 Biological Synopsis
The walrus is Canada's largest member of the seal family. It is a large animal with limbs that have developed into flippers, upper canine teeth that develop into long tusks (ivory) at about 2 years of age, and a moustache made of quill-like whiskers. Males and females are about 125 cm long at birth. As adults, males are significantly larger than females (Garlich-Miller & Stewart 1998). Adult males reach up to 1,100 kg in weight and 3.1 m in length and females can reach 800 kg and 2.8 m in length. Walrus can live to 40 years of age, and are considered to be long-lived animals. As walrus have a delayed sexual maturation, fairly low reproductive rates and specialized habitat requirements, they are vulnerable to over-harvesting and sensitive to environmental changes (COSEWIC 2006).
Mating occurs from February to April. Little is known about their reproduction because they mate in the water and in remote areas. Males mature between 7 and 13 years of age and compete intensely for females, defending access to them for up to five days. Females mature between 5 and 10 years of age and give birth on average every three years. Gestation lasts about 11 months and the young nurse for up to 27 months. Expectant mothers move onto land or ice to give birth. Protective care by mothers and the herd assures high calf survival (DFO 2007).
2.2 Ecosystem Interactions
The habitat requirements of the Atlantic walrus are very specific. They need large areas of shallow (100 m or less), open water that support an abundant clam community. In addition, there must be ice or land nearby to ‘haul out’. Moving pack ice is ideal for this purpose; however, in the summer and fall if ice is scarce, large herds congregate and haul out on low, rocky shores with steep subtidal zones. In areas of deeper water without plentiful clams, some walrus will consume seals. These walrus tend to be more aggressive, and are usually solitary or found in smaller groups. Although some hauled out groups of walrus may contain animals of all ages and both sexes, walrus tend to segregate by age and sex during most of the year. It is thought that females and their young return to certain sites more faithfully than do adult males (DFO 2007). Following harvesting by humans, polar bears are thought to be the main predators of walrus, though it is believed they take few animals.
The full effects of climate change on Atlantic walrus are unknown. However, potential effects of a warming climate may include, but are not limited to:
- A reduction in winter and summer ice cover
- A rise in sea level
- An increase in sediment transport
- An increase in the frequency and severity of storms
- An increase in the presence of killer whales in the Arctic.
These may all be important factors for walrus, potentially impacting food supply and/or quality, ecosystem interactions, affecting their ability to access food and appropriate haulout sites, thereby influencing their health, distribution and abundance. These affects could also impact hunters’ ability to access walrus.
2.3 Traditional Ecological Knowledge
Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) of walrus throughout Canada’s Arctic is extensive. Each community has hunters and elders that have knowledge in areas of distribution, seasonality, migration, birthing areas and haulout sites. Inuit have observed changes with respect to impacts from climate change, past and present disturbances and development/exploration. When shared, this information is considered with scientific knowledge to provide a more robust understanding of walrus distribution, movements and environmental interactions. TEK has also been used in assisting with the delineation of stocks and is used in the design of surveys by DFO Science to estimate population abundance. TEK is used with scientific data and observations to contribute to management decisions, as well as to identify information gaps, areas of uncertainty, and to set research priorities.
TEK has been recorded on unpublished maps, in meetings minutes, documented in a number of different published papers (DFO 2002a, DFO 2012a, NCRI 2014), and through consultations with experienced hunters and community elders.
Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit (IQ) consists of TEK, as well as Inuit beliefs about how the world works, and the values necessary to behave in an ethical manner in human interactions with the animals and the environment. The collaborative approach to developing this IFMP for walrus that includes representatives from HTOs and other co-management organizations has assisted in the inclusion of IQ, such as decision-making through consensus, working together for a common cause, and respect and care for the land, environment and animals (NWMB). This IFMP will allow for the continued inclusion of IQ, TEK and science as it becomes available.
2.4 Stock Delineation
Two populations of walrus have been identified in Canada based on analysis of microsatellite DNA (Shafer et al. 2013): the high Arctic population (comprised of the West Jones Sound, Baffin Bay and Penny Strait-Lancaster Sound stocks) and the central Arctic population (including the north and central Foxe Basin stocks and the Hudson Bay-Davis Strait stocks).
There are a number of factors used in delineating stocks, including ecological factors that determine distribution of walrus (ice cover, polynyas, shallow banks with suitable habitat, migration routes and availability of haulout sites), historical and current distribution, seasonal movements, age and sex composition, catch levels, composition of catches and hunting loss, hunter observations, harvest sites, survey observations, genetic information, satellite tagging data, heavy metal/ organochlorine data, lead isotope ratios and trace elements (Stewart 2008b).
Based on consultations with local communities, stock reassessment by the North Atlantic Marine Mammal Commission (NAMMCO) (2011), and Stewart (2008a), six stocks or management units of Atlantic walrus have been identified for management purposes in the NSA (Figure 2).
These include:
- Baffin Bay- Management Unit AW-01 (shared with Greenland);
- West Jones Sound- Management Unit AW-02;
- Penny Strait-Lancaster Sound- Management Unit AW-03;
- Foxe Basin- Management Unit AW-04;
- Hudson Bay- Davis Strait- Management Unit AW-05 (shared with Nunavik and Greenland);
- South and East Hudson Bay- Management Unit AW-06 (shared with Nunavik).
Note: This version of the IFMP does not apply to the Areas of Equal Use and Occupancy as set out in Schedule 40-1 ofthe Nunavut Agreement.
2.5 Precautionary Approach
A precautionary approach to fisheries management links harvest level recommendations with stock assessment data. Lower harvest levels are recommended when stock assessments are uncertain to avoid serious harm to fish or marine mammal stocks or their ecosystem. A lack of stock assessment data should not be used as a reason to postpone, or fail to take, management actions. This approach is widely accepted as an essential part of sustainable fisheries management.
In accordance with the Fisheries Act and the NA, the best available information guides walrus management decisions made on behalf of the NWMB and the Minister. A management decision to restrict Inuit harvesting shall do so only to the extent necessary to affect a valid conservation purpose; to give effect to the allocation system outlined in the NA; or to provide for public health or public safety (NA s. 5.3.3).
The amount of information available for resource management varies among species and populations. For those species where information on abundance, mortality and reproductive rates may be limited, DFO uses the Potential Biological Removal (PBR) method to estimate the maximum number of animals that may be removed by all human activities without depleting the stock or population (DFO 2012b). This total amount of removals accounted for using PBR would include removals of harvested animals, animals shot at, but not harvested (called struck and lost), as well as losses to ship strikes, net entanglements and any other human activities. The PBR is calculated using a number of biological parameters (Stewart 2008b, Stewart and Hamilton 2013).
In calculating sustainable harvest levels, PBR results are multiplied by a Loss Rate (LR) to obtain Total Allowable Landed Catch (TALC) values. Loss rates represent all indirect human caused mortalities (struck and lost, ship strikes, net entanglements). At this time, only struck and lost rates are considered in the estimate of TALC; however, this may change if more information becomes available.
TALC = PBR (1- LR)
Struck and lost rates are incomplete for walrus and can vary with season, weather, location, hunter experience, hunting technique/equipment, and animal behavior. In Canada, struck and lost rates have been documented to range between 30% and 32% (Orr et. al 1986), although some hunters believe the rates to be as low as 5% (DFO 2002a). Inuit harvesters have noted that loss rates will vary depending on when and how the walrus is harvested. NAMMCO applies a struck and lost rate of 30% for those stocks lacking specific loss rate information (2006).
2.6 Stock Assessment and Trends
Most indicators of trends in stock size are based on distributional changes, differences in physical conditions of the animal, and harvest data. Whenever there is a local decrease in numbers, it may be that the animals have moved to another area, but until increases in other parts of the range have been clearly documented, the possibility of a reduction in numbers should be considered.
Walrus are widely distributed in the eastern Canadian Arctic, and are most often found in aggregations, or groups, numbering from the tens, to thousands. In order to estimate walrus numbers, aerial surveys are conducted of walrus haulouts. Walrus haulouts are identified based on a number of factors including information from past surveys, existing scientific information, and local traditional knowledge. Data from satellite tags active during surveys are used to adjust the haulout counts to account for animals at sea, and therefore missed by the survey. If no active tags are in the survey area at the time of the survey, data from other walrus studies are used to estimate the numbers of walrus at sea, and determine an abundance estimate. Although aerial surveys combined with satellite telemetry are the standard methods used to estimate abundance of walrus populations across their range, new approaches, such as genetic capture-mark-recapture methods, should be investigated.
The most recent science advisory report on walrus abundance estimates can be found at:

Baffin Bay (BB) - Management Unit AW-01
In Canada, the Baffin Bay stock extends from eastern Jones Sound to eastern Ellesmere Island and NW Greenland (Stewart 2008a). Analysis of aerial surveys conducted by DFO and Greenland Institute of Natural Resources in 1999, 2005, and 2009 resulted in population abundance estimates ranging from 1,249 to 1,251 and PBR estimates to range from 10 to 11 walrus (DFO 2013, Stewart et al. 2013a, Stewart and Hamilton 2013). See Figure 2.
West Jones Sound (WJS) - Management Unit AW-02
This stock is separated from the Baffin Bay stock by seasonal distribution and tag movements (Stewart 2008a). Aerial surveys by DFO were conducted between 1998 and 2009, resulting in an abundance estimate ranging from 470 to 503, and PBR estimates ranging from 7 to 17 animals (DFO 2013, Stewart et al. 2013b, Stewart and Hamilton 2013). There was no statistically significant evidence of population change between these surveys and the late 1970s, but there were differences in coverage and walrus distribution may have changed. See Figure 2.
Penny Strait- Lancaster Sound (PS/LS) - Management Unit AW-03
This stock is separated from the Baffin Bay stock by isotope data, and from the West Jones Sound stock by distribution and tag movements (Stewart 2008a). Aerial surveys were conducted between 1998 and 2008 and resulted in an abundance estimate of 727 walrus in 2009 and PBR estimates ranging from 10 to 24 animals (DFO 2013, Stewart et al. 2013b, Stewart and Hamilton 2013). There was no statistically significant evidence of a trend in population numbers when the recent surveys were compared to similar surveys in the late 1970s, although differences in coverage and possible changes in walrus distribution may influence comparisons. See Figure 2.
Foxe Basin (FB) - Management Unit AW-04
Stewart (2008b) delineated the Foxe Basin stock into 2 units: northern Foxe Basin stock and central Foxe Basin stock. In Foxe Basin, the two stocks share an overwintering area and breed as a single unit, but they may occupy different areas in the summer and may be susceptible to different hunting pressures. Lead isotope ratios and trace element profiles from teeth suggest two different stocks, and since isotope ratios are a reflection of the migratory patterns of the animals, they are useful in discriminating management units. Although there is evidence to delineate two stocks in the Foxe Basin area, currently there is not enough information (science or TEK) to visually or geographically separate the stocks within the larger Foxe Basin area. Therefore, until additional information is available to further partition this stock, the management of walrus will continue to occur at the larger Foxe Basin management unit. See Figure 2.
Analysis of surveys conducted in 2010 and 2011 resulted in a range of abundance estimates of 8,153-13,452 and PBR estimates ranging from 211-422 walrus (DFO 2016, Stewart et al. 2013c, Stewart and Hamilton 2013).
Changes in the distribution of walrus within Foxe Basin have been documented by local hunters and researchers, with many haulouts being abandoned on the west coast (Mansfield 1966, Brody 1976, Anderson and Garlich-Miller 1994, DFO 2002a). This may suggest declines in numbers of walrus, habitat availability, or both. Local Inuit have noted that ice conditions have changed in Foxe Basin resulting in a reduction of multiyear ice that walrus use for hauling out on.
Hudson Bay-Davis Strait (HBDS)- Management Unit AW-05
Walrus from the Hudson Bay-Davis Strait (HBDS) stock have been distinguished from the other five stocks based on distances, movements, differences in growth patterns, as well as differences in genetics, contaminants, and lead isotope ratios (DFO 2002b, COSEWIC 2006, Stewart 2008a). A comprehensive, systematic survey over the entire geographic area has not occurred for this stock. Currently, due to the limited amount of data over the stock’s full range, it is not possible to determine the size or trend of this stock. See Figure 2.
South and East Hudson Bay (SEHB)- Management Unit AW-06
The South and East Hudson Bay walrus stock was originally delineated by Born et al. (1995) on the basis of distribution, but since then, lead isotope data has provided stronger evidence that supports the differentiation between this stock and the Hudson Bay-Davis Strait stock (Stewart 2008a). A complete or comprehensive survey of this stock has not been conducted. Based on a few walrus sightings in a large geographical area over a long period of time, Richard and Campbell (1988) and Born et al. (1995) estimated the population size to be a minimum of 410 and 500 animals, respectively (COSEWIC 2006). Currently, due to the limited amount of data, it is not possible to determine the size or trend of this stock. See Figure 2.
|Population||Stock/Management Unit||Abundance Estimates||PBR|
|High Arctic||Baffin Bay (BB)/ AW-01||1249-1251||10-11|
|West Jones Sound (WJS)/ AW-02||470-503||8-17|
|Penny Strait- Lancaster Sound (PS-LS)/ AW-03||623-831||12-24|

|Hudson Bay-Davis Strait/ AW-05||No recent estimate.||---|
|Unknown||South and East Hudson Bay/ AW-06||No recent estimate.||---|
(Stewart and Hamilton 2013, DFO 2013, DFO 2016)
PBR represents the total number of animals that can be removed from all human activities while allowing the stock or population to maintain or achieve its optimal sustainable level.
2.7 Research
The following research is required:
- Determine abundance estimates for Hudson Bay-Davis Strait and South and East Hudson Bay stocks;
- Apply new methods to determine walrus abundance, such as genetic capture-mark-recapture;
- Continue to research genetic diversity and stock discrimination;
- Continue to investigate and assess potential threats resulting from human activities (e.g., shipping routes, noise disturbance, tourism);
- Determine the extent of exchange between shared Canada/Greenland stocks;
- Determine changes in habitat availability (pack ice and food); and
- Continue to investigate distribution and abundance of stocks.
3. Social, Cultural and Economic Importance of the Fishery
For centuries, walrus have been used by Inuit as a traditional food source and for supplying important materials for day to day living. Walrus meat is eaten in raw, cooked or fermented (igunak) forms by Inuit. Molluscs found in walrus stomachs are considered a delicacy in some Inuit communities (Whitford 2008). Some communities now obtain their walrus meat and tusks from hunters in other communities rather than conduct their own hunts (DFO 2012a).
Historically, walrus products provided materials for numerous necessities required for arctic living such as bones used for carvings, tent poles, and walking sticks, tusks/ ivory used to construct harpoons, toggles, handles, and handicrafts, sinews used for sewing thread, and skin for tents and ropes. The tusk and baculum (penis bone) are valuable economic commodities and provide important sources of cash income, particularly, for the hunting communities. Ivory from walrus is commonly used for carvings and crafts and is sold both inside and outside the NSA. Although not as much trade occurs with walrus products as some other arctic species, international and domestic trade does still occur, mostly via exporters in southern Canada. International export of walrus products includes carved and un-carved tusks, bones, teeth, skeletons and skulls. International markets for Canadian walrus products include France, India, China, Japan, Korea, Singapore, United States and Australia (Shadbolt et. al 2014).
The walrus sport hunt in some communities can provide a major source of cash income through the hiring of local guides, and sport hunters purchasing various goods and services (food, crafts, and accommodations). Sport hunters are permitted to keep the tusks, baculum and head of the walrus, but the meat remains within the community for community use.
Hunting walrus, especially at traditional summer hunting camps, helps foster interdependence both within and between communities, provides opportunities to share knowledge between generations and community members and strengthens kinship ties and community cohesion. These cultural values are difficult to measure in economic terms but are very important to help maintain the Inuit way of life. The walrus hunt itself, as well as the sharing of the products of the hunt, continues to be of great social, cultural and economic significance to Inuit and the economic value of the meat and the ivory is substantial (COSEWIC 2006).
4. Management Issues
IFMPs are required to cover all aspects of a fishery, in particular, those areas that are related to the sustainability of the target species, ecosystem considerations and monitoring. The following represent the main management issues for the Atlantic walrus in the NSA.
4.1 Fisheries Issues
Abundance Estimates
While recent estimates are available for four of the six walrus stocks or management units, abundance estimates are still required for the Hudson Bay-Davis Strait stock and the South and East Hudson Bay stock. Funding for surveys will be needed to obtain abundance estimates and recommend sustainable harvest levels.
Sustainable Harvest Levels
It is important to ensure the conservation of walrus and that the harvesting of walrus is sustainable. There is growing national and international pressure to demonstrate that walrus are being harvested at sustainable levels. This will require the establishment of sustainable harvest levels for all stocks.
Struck and Lost Rates
Accurate struck and lost rates are important for understanding the impacts of hunting and to maximize sustainable harvest levels. Struck and lost rates vary or are incomplete in the NSA. Determining appropriate struck and lost rates are required in order to estimate sustainable harvest levels.
Hunter Training/ Reducing Loss Rates
Training for harvesters and youth has been identified as an important component for the sustainable management of the walrus fishery. This would include training on the best harvesting techniques, when and where to harvest, hunter safety, preparation and preservation of meat, and how to minimize struck and lost rates. HTOs may develop plans or best management practices that set out practical measures for community hunters to reduce the number of struck and lost walrus while harvesting.
Monitoring and Reporting
Once a TAH/BNL is established for walrus, a method to control removals will be required to ensure walrus harvesting remains within regulated harvest levels.
Timely, accurate reporting of walrus harvesting is essential. Without complete and accurate estimates of local harvesting activity, co-managers must exercise caution when recommending harvest limits so that vital, healthy walrus populations/stocks that are capable of sustaining harvesting needs of Inuit can be maintained. The timeliness of the reporting allows managers to assess the harvest as limits are approached.
Sport Hunt
There is a need for all HTOs that pursue sport hunt opportunities to develop by-laws or guidelines that would identify the community rules or best management practices for the sport hunt.
Ship Traffic/Development/Tourism
There are a number of potential impacts and threats to walrus and walrus habitat resulting from increased development and shipping activities. These could include increased oil spills, ship strikes, disruption of migration, avoidance of ecologically or biologically important areas (e.g. birthing, mating or feeding areas), noise disturbance and the introduction of alien or invasive species through activities such as ballast water exchange. Tourism is increasing in the Arctic and concern with increased disturbance to important walrus areas (e.g. haulouts) has been expressed.
4.2 Oceans and Habitat Considerations
Under the Health of the Oceans Initiative, Ecologically and Biologically Significant Areas (EBSAs) in the Eastern Arctic were identified (DFO 2011). Experts from Canadian federal departments, academics, Inuit organizations and various environmental non-government organizations having expertise in a number of different areas were involved. EBSAs are intended to identify areas that have high ecological or biological significance and are useful in assisting with management decisions.
The EBSAs were evaluated based on set criteria for marine biogeographic regions. Of the 41 EBSAs identified in the Eastern Arctic, 14 included walrus as a component contributing to the EBSA criteria. The ecological functions identified as being important for walrus included known distribution, presence of haulouts, migration corridors, presence of polynyas, calving areas and feeding grounds.
4.3 National and International Issues
Food Safety
Outbreaks of trichinosis have been reported in Nunavut over the years, most commonly from consuming meat that has been infected with a parasitic worm called Trichinella nativa, which lives inside the bodies of walrus and some other birds and mammals. The Government of Nunavut’s department of health has responsibilities around food safety within the Nunavut Settlement Area and have established programs to test walrus meat for the parasite that causes the disease. Harvesters are asked to contact their HTO or a Government of Nunavut Environmental Health Officer for additional information on the Nunavut Trichinosis Prevention Program.
COSEWIC and SARA
COSEWIC (Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada) is an independent committee of government and non-government experts that assesses and designates the status of wildlife species that may be in some danger of disappearing from Canada. COSEWIC uses a process based on science, Aboriginal Traditional Knowledge and community knowledge to assess the risk of extinction for wildlife species. Wildlife species that have been designated at risk by COSEWIC may then qualify for legal protection and recovery or management under the Species at Risk Act (SARA).
The Species at Risk Act is a federal Act that was created to prevent Canadian species and their distinct populations from becoming extirpated or extinct, to provide for the recovery of Extirpated, Endangered or Threatened species, and to encourage the management of Special Concern species to prevent them from becoming further at risk. In the case of species listed as Special Concern, a management plan must be created which outlines the actions required to help prevent the species from becoming further at risk. For Extirpated, Endangered and Threatened species, a Recovery Strategy and Action Plan are developed which outline exactly what will be done to help recover the species to a larger, “pre-harm” population size. For Extirpated, Endangered and Threatened species, SARA also provides legal protection of their critical habitats and prevents any harm to the species, except under certain circumstances.
In 2006, COSEWIC designated Atlantic walrus as a species of Special Concern. However, the species is scheduled to be reassessed by COSEWIC and while the ‘special concern’ designation for a single population of Atlantic walrus could remain, it could be replaced with a higher designation of risk or multiple populations with multiple at risk designations. Once assessed by COSEWIC the Government of Canada will follow an established process to determine whether or not to recommend listing the species under the Species at Risk Act. This process includes biological, social and economic assessments of possible listing scenarios, as well as consultation with co-management organizations, stakeholders and interested individuals.
This IFMP could help inform any SARA-compliant documents that would be required if walrus was added to the List of Wildlife Species at Risk on SARA.
CITES
The Atlantic walrus is listed on Appendix III of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). As such, anyone wishing to export walrus parts or derivatives from Canada must obtain an export permit from the Canadian CITES administration. A non-detriment finding (indicating that levels of export are not detrimental to the survival of the species in the wild) is not required for species on Appendix III of CITES.
In 2009 and 2012 the United States considered submitting a proposal to up-list walrus to Appendix II of CITES based on the lack of information around the management of the species (e.g. sustainable harvest levels) and population species information (e.g. population abundance estimates). If listed on Appendix II of CITES, a non-detrimental finding (NDF) decision from the DFO Scientific Authority would be required to obtain a CITES Export/Re-export permit to export walrus products internationally.
Shared Stocks: Nunavik
Harvesting of the Hudson Bay-Davis Strait and South and East Hudson Bay stocks occurs in both the Nunavut Settlement Area and Nunavik Marine Region. As there are no population abundance estimates for these two stocks, the existing regulatory regime and quotas identified in the Fisheries Act and the Marine Mammal Regulations, and provisions in the Nunavut Agreement and the Nunavik Inuit Land Claims Agreement would continue to apply.
Shared Stocks: Greenland
Some stocks of Atlantic walrus inhabit and are harvested in both Canadian and Greenland waters. As such, it is important that discussions on management and sustainable harvesting occur between the two countries.
5. Objectives
A number of objectives were established for the walrus fishery. Long term objectives guide the management of the fishery and may be categorized as stock conservation, ecosystem, shared stewardship and social, cultural and economic objectives. Each long term objective is supported by one or more short term objectives. Various co-management organizations may take the lead in developing specific actions to address certain objectives.
|Objectives|
|Long-term:||Short-term:|

6. Access and Allocation
Upon ratification of the NA in 1993, all existing restrictions or quotas on the amount of wildlife that could be harvested within the NSA were retained and deemed to have been established by the NWMB.
6.1 Where a Total Allowable Harvest has not been established
Unless a TAH has been established, an individual Inuk may harvest up to four (4) walrus in a year without a licence (MMR s. 6(1) (c)), except where community quotas exist (MMR s.26). Annual quotas have been set for the communities of Coral Harbour (60), Sanikiluaq (10), Arctic Bay (10) and Clyde River (20).
6.1.1 Sport Hunt
Marine Mammal Fishing Licences may be issued for non-beneficiaries to participate in walrus sport hunts (MMR s.4) provided there is support from the local HTO and annual approval from the NWMB based on its Interim NWMB Sport Hunt Policy. Sport hunters must provide detailed harvest reporting directly to DFO. The full Walrus Sport Hunt Policy can be found in Appendix 3.
6.1.2 Harvest Reporting
Harvest information is provided by Inuit hunters to the HTOs, which is then relayed to DFO (MMR s. 17; Fisheries Act s. 61; NA s. 5.7.43). Appendix 1 provides information on annual quotas and landed catch for communities that have harvested walrus. These numbers are not corrected for hunting losses. A Fishery Officer will notify the community and HTO when the quota has been reached and will close the fishery (MMR s. 12, 26).
6.2 Where a Total Allowable Harvest has been established:
The NWMB is in the process of establishing Total Allowable Harvest (TAH) levels and Basic Needs Levels (BNL) for walrus. In 2013, the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans accepted the NWMB’s decision to establish the BNL for beluga, narwhal and walrus in the NSA to be equal to the levels of TAH for those species. Therefore, since the BNL is the first demand on the TAH, Inuit will always have the right to the entire TAH. RWOs and HTOs are responsible for allocating this BNL/TAH, as well as regulating harvesting practices and techniques among their members, including the use of NQLs.
Article 40 of the NA will be considered for other Inuit or aboriginal groups that may demonstrate traditional use of walrus in the NSA.
6.2.1 Total Allowable Harvests
Total Allowable Harvest levels have been established for the following stocks:
|Population||Stock/ Management Unit||Harvesting Community||TAH||Community Harvest Level|
|High Arctic||Baffin Bay /AW-01||Grise Fiord||To be established|
|West Jones Sound / AW-02||Grise Fiord||To be established|
|Penny Strait- Lancaster Sound /AW-03||Arctic Bay||To be established|
|Central Arctic||Foxe Basin / AW-04||Hall Beach||To be established|
Pond Inlet
Resolute
Igloolik
*see Figure 2 for a map of Atlantic walrus by stocks and management units.
6.2.2 Allocation of the TAH:
As identified in the NA, the RWOs will be responsible for allocating annual regional BNL, which in the case of walrus will be the TAH, to their respective community HTOs, regulating their members and fulfilling other wildlife co-management obligations in accordance with the NA. The community HTOs will be responsible for allocating and enforcing the community BNL (community harvest limit) among members, and generally the management of harvesting among members (see Figure 3).
Where a TAH has been established for a walrus management unit, the combined annual community harvest limits for that management unit shall not exceed the TAH.
6.2.3 Sport Hunt
An assignment under section 5.7.34 (b) of the NA is used to authorize walrus sport hunts to a person qualified to harvest walrus under the laws of general application. Under this section, a person authorized to harvest walrus under a licence may be assigned part or all of a share of the total allowable harvest by an Inuk, RWO or HTO. Through the assignment provisions, an Inuk, an HTO or a RWO may assign its share of the TAH to a walrus sport hunt, if so desired, so long as the established annual total allowable harvest for that particular management unit is not exceeded.
An assignment under Article 5 of the NA must be evidenced by documentation containing information on both the assignor, and the assignee. Once the required documentation is received by DFO, the Minister may issue a Walrus Marine Mammal Fishing Licence (MMR s.4). The full Walrus Sport Hunt Policy can be found in Appendix 3.
6.2.4 Post-Harvest Walrus Tag
For management units where a TAH has been established.
The Post-Harvest Walrus Tag is an important management tool for RWOs and HTOs to be able to allocate and account for harvesting among their members. Where a TAH has been established, DFO will issue Post-Harvest Walrus Tag to the RWO and/or HTOs in the amount equal to the annual harvest level for the corresponding management unit. Post-Harvest Walrus Tags will be allocated by the RWO/HTO and will be proof of allocation to a share of one walrus from the walrus TAH for a particular management unit. This forms part of the walrus management system in which RWOs and HTOs decide on community allocations, in the form of community harvest limits.
The Post-Harvest Walrus Tag is not a licence to hunt and will be issued without fee or administrative charge. A Walrus Harvest Tag system will assist in:
- Evidencing a person’s authority to harvest/possess wildlife appropriate to the particular Management Unit;
- Regulating the allocation of a share of TAH, including the BNL, as allocated by the RWO and/or HTO;
- Collecting information in relation to harvesting activities;
- Regulating harvesting activities in relation to sport hunt assignment.
6.2.5 Harvest Reporting and Monitoring
Hunters provide information on their hunts to their HTO. HTOs will provide the information to the RWO and DFO in a timely manner. A Fishery Officer will notify the community and HTOs when the harvest level has been reached for a management unit and will close the fishery (MMR s. 12, 26).
- Harvest information must be reported (MMR s. 17; Fisheries Act s. 61; NA s. 5.7.43):
7. Management Measures for the Duration of the Plan
The management measures identified in the IFMP outline the controls or rules adopted for the walrus fishery for the purposes of stock conservation and sustainable management. These measures are based on the Fisheries Act, the Marine Mammal Regulations and the NA.
The Marine Mammal Regulations (MMR) include provisions related to the hunting, movement, and sale of walrus products. These provisions include requirements for hunters to hunt a walrus in a manner that is designed to kill it quickly, to make reasonable efforts to retrieve a killed or wounded walrus without delay and to have all necessary equipment on hand to retrieve it. Abandoning, discarding or wasting edible parts of walrus is prohibited.
Domestic movement of walrus products requires a DFO Marine Mammal Transportation Licence. Indians or Inuit who land walrus in one jurisdiction and are returning to their home in another jurisdiction are exempted from this requirement. International trade of walrus products requires a CITES Export/Re-export Permit.
A full list of the management measures can be found in Appendix 2.
8. Shared Stewardship Arrangements
The Atlantic walrus IFMP was initiated and developed by the Foxe Basin Walrus Working Group in 2007 and the High Arctic-Baffin Bay Walrus Working Group in 2009. Participation on the Working Groups includes representatives from each of the HTOs, the Qikiqtaaluk Wildlife Board (co-chair), NTI and DFO. Staff from the NWMB have attended Working Group meetings when possible. The Working Groups invite subject-matter experts to provide additional information in the development of the IFMP as required. This has included representatives from the mining industry and community elders.
The Walrus Working Groups produced Terms of References to help guide the development of the IFMP. Meetings have been held in the communities of Resolute, Grise Fiord, Arctic Bay, Pond Inlet, Hall Beach and Igloolik to obtain the views of elders and community members on issues related to walrus management, including the identification of fishery issues and long and short term objectives for the fishery.
There are a number of different ways that the objectives for the fishery may be achieved, such as the effective implementation of the management measures identified in Appendix 2. Other measures may be initiated by co-management organizations through the development of by-laws or guidelines. Once developed, these would be included as an Appendix of the IFMP.
9. Compliance Plan
The Conservation and Protection program promotes and maintains compliance with legislation and regulations implemented to achieve the conservation and sustainable use of Canada’s aquatic resources, and the protection of species at risk, fish habitat and oceans. Conservation and Protection works closely with internal partners to evaluate risks to fish and fish habitat to ensure program delivery meets Departmental objectives.
Fishery Officers monitor fishing and related activities to ensure compliance with the Fisheries Act and its regulations as well as several other federal statutes. Fishery Officers investigate violations of these acts and regulations and resolve them by applying various compliance options.
Regional Compliance Program Delivery
Fishery Officers in the Eastern Arctic Area monitor the Atlantic walrus fishery and the trade of Atlantic walrus products for compliance with the MMR which are made pursuant to the Fisheries Act. Conservation and Protection works closely with internal and external partners to consult on and or resolve compliance issues.
Fishery Officers promote compliance with regulations by working with user groups (e.g. hunters and buyers) and other stakeholders to better understand the laws. Fishery Officers engage hunters and people involved in the marine mammal trade industry to provide information that increases awareness and helps address compliance and conservation concerns in the Atlantic walrus fishery. Increased education and awareness will help protect the legal market and trade of Atlantic walrus ivory and parts.
Current Compliance Issues
Specific concerns may arise from: failing to follow conditions of licence for the sport hunt, non-reporting or misreporting of harvest, wastage, illegal harvest or illegal trade and exporting of Atlantic walrus ivory and or parts. Patrols have been conducted in Atlantic walrus hunting areas and communities to monitor these concerns.
Compliance Strategy
Conservation and Protection collaborates with internal and external partners to identify and prioritize compliance issues and works with resource managers to address them.
Fishery Officers focus efforts on:
- compliance with legislation, including sport hunt licence conditions;
- tusk traceability / illegal trade of ivory tusks;
- licence inspections.
Operational Activities include:
- Monitoring of Atlantic walrus sport hunts;
- Education of user groups and stakeholders;
- Inspections of Atlantic walrus products from harvest to export;
- Cross reference of harvest data with trade data;
- Liaise with Nunavut Conservation Officers and other territorial or provincial law enforcement agencies.

10. Performance Review
This Atlantic walrus IFMP was developed through an extensive consultative process including the NWMB, NTI, RWOs, HTOs, walrus hunters and community members. DFO will continue to consult with these groups throughout the life of this IFMP as circumstances require.
Annual post season review sessions will be conducted with co-management organizations and as circumstances require. Progress on achieving the short term objectives and effective implementation of management measures identified in the Plan will be reviewed. Recommendations to improve management of the walrus fishery will be developed to meet the long term objectives of maintaining a sustainable walrus fishery.

- Hunters are to use a rifle or shotgun with the following restrictions: a) a rifle and non-full metal jacketed ammunition that produce a muzzle energy of not less than 1,500 foot pounds; or b) a shotgun and rifled slugs that produce a muzzle energy of not less than 1,500 foot pounds (MMR s. 25).
- A Marine Mammal Transportation Licence is required to transport walrus or walrus parts from one province to another (MMR s. 16).
- A CITES Export Permit is required to transport walrus products outside of Canada.
- Fisheries Act s. 35: prohibits any person from carrying on any work, undertaking or activity that results in serious harm to walrus that are part of a commercial, recreational or Aboriginal fishery, unless authorized by the Minister.
Appendix 3. Walrus Sport Hunt Policy in the Nunavut Settlement Area
A. Where a Total Allowable Harvest has been established for a walrus stock or population
Where the Nunavut Wildlife Management Board (NWMB) and the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) establish a total allowable harvest (TAH) for a stock or population of walrus in the Nunavut Settlement Area (NSA), the assignment provisions of the Nunavut Agreement (NA) shall be used to assign part or all of the TAH to a walrus sport hunt.
In 2013, the Minister of DFO accepted the NWMB’s decision to establish the basic needs levels (BNL) for beluga, narwhal and walrus in the NSA to be equal to the levels of total allowable harvest (TAH) established or modified by the NWMB. As per the NA, Hunters and Trappers Organizations (HTO) and Regional Wildlife Organizations (RWOs) are responsible for allocating their community’s and regional TAH to their members and the assignment to non-members (e.g. walrus sport hunt) (s. 5.7.3 and 5.7.6).
An assignment under section 5.7.34 (b) of the NA is used to authorize walrus sport hunts to a person qualified to harvest walrus under the laws of general application, so long as the established annual total allowable harvest for that particular management unit is not exceeded.
Under sections 5 and 6 of the Marine Mammal Regulations, no person other than an Indian, Inuk, or beneficiary, may fish for walrus except under the authority of a licence.
If an HTO wishes to assign part or all of a share of their community’s allocation of the TAH for walrus sport hunting purposes, the following process will be undertaken to obtain a valid Marine Mammal Fishing Licence prior to engaging in walrus hunting activities:
The HTO will:
- Complete and submit the Sport Hunt Application package to DFO.
- Upon receiving the completed documents and payment of fee, the Minister of DFO may issue a Marine Mammal Fishing Licence for walrus pursuant to section 4(1) of the Marine Mammal Regulations.
- All conditions identified on the Marine Mammal Fishing Licence must be followed by the assignee (sport hunter). The Marine Mammal Regulations (MMR) include provisions related to the hunting, movement, and sale of walrus products. These provisions include requirements for hunters to report on harvesting activities, to collect biological samples, to hunt in a manner that is designed to kill the walrus quickly, to make reasonable efforts to retrieve a killed or wounded walrus without delay and to have all necessary equipment on hand to retrieve it. Abandoning, discarding or wasting edible parts of walrus is prohibited.
- Any HTO by-laws that are in place governing walrus hunting will also be followed by the assignee (sport hunter).
- A DFO Marine Mammal Transportation Licence is required to transport walrus or walrus parts from one province to another (MMR s. 16(1)). These are free and available from a DFO Fishery Officer or from the community’s local Conservation Officer.
- Anyone wishing to export walrus parts or derivatives from Canada must obtain an export permit from the Canadian CITES administration. These permits can take several weeks to obtain. For more information, contact the DFO CITES Permitting Officer at: (888) 641-6464.
B. Where a TAH has not been established for a walrus stock or population
Each year the Nunavut Wildlife Management Board (NWMB) requests applications (Request to Conduct Walrus Sport Hunts) from communities and individuals for walrus sport hunts. These applications are reviewed by the NWMB according to its Interim Policy for Walrus Sport Hunts. Decisions of the NWMB are forwarded to the Minister of Fisheries & Oceans Canada (DFO). If approved, and upon payment of fee, the Minister will provide the applicant with a Marine Mammal Fishing Licence under section 4(1) of the Marine Mammal Regulations. The process is detailed in the steps below:
Request to conduct walrus sport hunt:
Each fall, the NWMB seeks applications from individuals and communities who wish to conduct walrus sport hunts for the following walrus harvesting season (April 1-March 31). Applicants are required to submit a completed “Request to Conduct Walrus Sport Hunt” form that includes information on the hunt plan, outfitter information, a safety plan, and evidence of support from the local HTO.
NWMB review of applications:
The NWMB reviews the Requests to Conduct Walrus Sport Hunts against its Interim Policy for Walrus Sport Hunts. This Policy seeks to consider conservation concerns, health and safety, humane harvesting and minimization of waste, and long-term economic, social and cultural interests of Inuit harvesters, in making sport hunt decisions.
NWMB decision to DFO:
Decisions of the NWMB in relation to the walrus sport hunt are forwarded to the Minister of DFO as per the NA. Additional conditions may be included with the NWMB decision, such as the assignment of each walrus to a sport hunter is made in writing and that individuals applying for walrus sport hunts obtain written support from their local HTO.
DFO review:
The decisions of the NWMB are forwarded to the Minister of DFO for review. If approved, DFO will notify successful applicants. Upon receiving the completed “Assignment Document”, “Hunter Information Sheet”, and payment of fee, the Minister of DFO will issue a Marine Mammal Fishing Licence for walrus pursuant to section 4(1) of the Marine Mammal Regulations.
Marine Mammal Fishing Licence:
All conditions identified on a Marine Mammal Fishing Licence must be followed. Such conditions include: when and where the hunt is authorized to take place, by whom, their country of origin, quotas, gear type to be used, as well as any specific conditions related to the hunt, such as the reporting of all hunts to the local DFO office, firearm muzzle velocity requirements, the total number of strikes allowed, as well as biological sampling requirements.
Any HTO by-laws that are in place governing walrus hunting should be followed by the sport hunter.
A DFO Marine Mammal Transportation Licence is required to transport walrus or walrus parts from one province to another (MMR s. 16(1)). These are free and available from a DFO Fishery Officer or from a local Conservation Officer.
Anyone wishing to export walrus parts or derivatives from Canada must obtain an export permit from the Canadian CITES administration. These permits can take several weeks to obtain. For more information, contact the DFO CITES Permitting Officer at: (888) 641-6464.

- . Spotlight on Marine Protected Areas in Canada
The MPA Spotlight report celebrates progress to date in protecting the marine environment through federal, provincial and territorial protected areas in Canada's three oceans and Great Lakes. The report was developed collaboratively, and contains national and regional marine protected area statistics and maps.
SEPTEMBER 2010 UPDATE:
Two new MPAs have been designated since this report was first printed. In June 2010, Gwaii Haanas National Marine Conservation Area Reserve and Haida Heritage Site (3500 km2) in British Columbia was established under the Canada National Marine Conservation Areas Act, and in August 2010, Tarium Niryutait Marine Protected Area (1740 km2) in the Northwest Territories was designated under the Oceans Act. These areas are not included in the statistics of this report.

Preface
Canada is a maritime nation. Our oceans and Great Lakes cover an area of approximately 5.7million square kilometres.We have the world's longest coastline, three oceans, the Great Lakes and an immense sea of Arctic ice—all of which support an intricate web of marine life. The Government of Canada, along with the provinces and territories, is working to conserve Canada's marine ecosystems through the development of marine protected areas. Marine protected areas enhance biodiversity and improve the health and sustainable use of our oceans, Great Lakes and coastlines, contributing to the vitality of Canadian coastal communities and industries.
This report highlights marine protected area efforts that have been completed by provincial, territorial and federal agencies in Canada to date. It describes the current status of these efforts, and includes data compiled collaboratively by federal and provincial representatives. The report is not intended to provide a comprehensive study of the management tools available for the protection and conservation of marine life (it does not include fisheries closures, for example), but rather focuses on existing marine protected areas in our three oceans and Great Lakes.
Marine Protected Areas in Canada
Canada's oceans and Great Lakes together have a surface area of approximately 5.7 million square kilometres— an area equivalent to about 56% of Canada's land mass.
What is a marine protected area?
The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) defines a marine protected area as: ""a clearly defined geographical space, recognized, dedicated and managed, through legal or other effective means, to achieve the long-term conservation of nature with associated ecosystem services and cultural values."" Some marine protected areas are fully marine, and others are the marine components of terrestrial protected areas.
There are many different types of marine protected areas in Canada.While some are fully protected, most allow multiple uses, or integrate fully protected zones within larger multiple-use areas. Some marine protected areas offer year-round protection while others are seasonal. Seasonal protection is appropriate for spawning or nesting sites or for buffering sensitive areas that may be threatened by human activities at specific times of the year.
Ocean Facts:
- Scientists believe that life appeared in the early oceans 3.5 to 3.7 billion years ago.
- Climate, weather and the quality of the air we breathe depend on interactions between the ocean and the atmosphere.
- Oceans are a primary source of food.
- History illustrates the importance of oceans for trade, commerce, adventure and discovery.
- The majority of the world's human population lives no more than 300 kilometres from the ocean.
- The ocean has shaped our customs, traditions, and fisheries culture.
Why do we need marine protected areas?
Scientists around the world have provided irrefutable evidence that the oceans, in spite of their seemingly healthy appearance, are fragile and at risk. A multitude of cumulative stresses exerted on coastal and ocean regions—from over-fishing to habitat degradation and climate change—means that ecosystem functions are being affected all over the world, including in Canada's oceans and Great Lakes.
Marine protected areas are known to be effective in protecting plants, animals and habitats. They improve the resilience of ecosystems and can have spill-over benefits to areas outside their boundaries. However, in 2007 Canada was ranked only 70th out of 228 countries around the world in establishment of marine protected areas. Despite recent progress in establishing new areas, there is still a significant challenge ahead.
Benefits of marine protected areas to environment, economy and culture
- Marine protected areas play an important role in the local marine ecosystem by increasing biodiversity, restoring community structure, and strengthening ecosystems' abilities to resist, recover from, or adapt to disturbances (such as those caused by overexploitation or climate change).
- Scientific research demonstrates that both tropical and temperate marine protected areas can increase the biodiversity within their boundaries. Certain species benefit from protection in marine protected areas more than others. For example, species that are highly exploited, large-bodied, high in the food chain or sedentary are especially likely to thrive in a marine protected area. Benefits tend to increase over time – especially in temperate waters.
- Marine protected areas can improve the economy of coastal communities by providing conservation and tourism-related employment opportunities. Also, since the creation of marine protected areas can result in increases in the size and abundance of fish, they can create spillover benefits to adjacent fishing grounds. This can translate into fisheries benefits over time including higher catches, increased catch rates and reductions of fishing effort. A marine protected area can thus contribute to the economic and socio-cultural well-being of coastal communities, including supporting subsistence and traditional harvesting of marine resources carried out by Aboriginal peoples.
Marine protected areas and climate change
- Marine protected areas can contribute to climate change mitigation by protecting certain marine habitats that are especially good at absorbing carbon dioxide, emitted to the atmosphere from the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and other human activities. For example, coastal habitats such as salt marshes, sea grasses and mangroves account for less than 0.5% of the world's seabed, but studies have shown they can store up to 71% of the total amount of carbon found in ocean sediments. Marine protected areas can also facilitate adaptation to climate change impacts, through protection of ecologically significant habitats (e.g., sources of larval supply), as well as through protection of multiple sites of similar habitat type.
- This increases the likelihood that at least one sample of the habitat type and its associated biodiversity will remain intact, should a catastrophic event occur in the region; thus contributing to the overall resilience (ability to adapt to change) of the marine environment.
Canada's national and international commitments
Canada is committed—both nationally and internationally— to protect its extraordinary marine environments for the benefit of present and future generations. Canada's Oceans Act tasks the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans to lead and coordinate the development and implementation of a national network of marine protected areas on behalf of the Government of Canada. In addition, a global commitment to establish networks of marine protected areas was made at the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development, and in the 2004 United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity Program of Work on Protected Areas.
Canada has approximately eight federal and 40 provincial/territorial legislative or regulatory tools for establishing protected areas with a marine component, including those located within the Great Lakes.
Each protected area included in this report is:
- located on the coast or seaward of the coastline;
- consistent with the IUCN definition of a protected area—i.e., a clearly defined geographical space in Canada, recognized, dedicated, and managed, through legal or other effective means, to achieve the long-term conservation of nature with associated ecosystem services and cultural values, that is situated partly or wholly in the marine environment (which includes intertidal or subtidal ocean, saltmarshes, estuaries, Great Lakes or wetlands associated with Great Lakes).
Saltmarshes and estuaries are integrally linked to the ocean environment – their ecology directly impacts the ocean and vice versa – through the transfer of salt water and marine species. Coastal wetlands share similar linkages with the Great Lakes they border.
A range of legislative and regulatory tools exists to establish marine protected areas in Canada, each designed to achieve a particular conservation purpose.
Once a candidate site has been selected for its potential to contribute to a particular conservation goal, consultative and administrative processes are triggered. Cooperation and understanding at the local level are generally fostered through formal or informal consultations and public outreach activities.
Working groups or advisory bodies may be established to develop and assess proposals for candidate sites. Sometimes interjurisdictional agreements are negotiated as part of the process.
As all these steps take time and consultation, it often takes years before a marine protected area is officially established.
Overview of marine protected areas in Canada
In total, existing marine protected areas cover over 56 000 square kilometres of Canada's oceans and Great Lakes—roughly equivalent to the area of Nova Scotia. The breakdown of federal, provincial, and non-governmental agencies responsible for managing these marine protected areas is illustrated on the left, with the total number of marine protected areas managed by each jurisdiction shown in brackets in the legend. Out of the 797 marine protected areas captured in this report, 705 of them are managed provincially, 83 are managed federally, and the remaining nine are managed by either non-governmental organizations or through co-management arrangements. The level of protection provided by different jurisdictions varies, depending on both their mandate and the conservation objective(s) of the site.
Most of Canada's existing protected marine area is protected for ecological reasons—although in some cases the ecological purpose is combined with sustainable harvesting and/or socio-cultural purposes to reflect multiple priorities. Ecological, socio-cultural, and sustainable use considerations are all very interconnected in oceans management. The health of a marine ecosystem has real impacts on the amount of fish and other resources that can be sustainably harvested from it,which affects local economies and community well-being. Therefore, protecting an area for ecological reasons provides benefits beyond the ecosystem.
The IUCN has established an international system of categorization for reporting on protected areas (including marine protected areas) at the global level. The categories include protected areas created for: science or as strict nature reserves (Categories Ia and Ib); ecosystem protection and recreation (Category II); outstanding natural features (Category III); particular species and habitats (Category IV); landscapes and seascapes shaped by human interaction (Category V); and protected areas created for sustainable use (Category VI). The categorization is meant to reflect the management approach for a given marine protected area. The most appropriate category depends on an area's specific conservation objectives.
Information compiled about the IUCN categories of Canada's marine protected areas indicates that most of the protected area was 'conserved ecosystems' and 'natural areas' (Categories Ia – II). Each IUCN category provides some type of ecological benefit to Canada's marine environment, although the specific benefits vary.
Now taking a closer look by region...
There are too many marine protected areas in Canada to profile each of them in this report. Instead the following pages will highlight examples of various types of marine protected areas from across the country, designated by different means, and established for a variety of conservation purposes.
Arctic
The Arctic Ocean is a vast region dominated and shaped by the presence of ice, which has a major influence on all biological activity. Much of the Arctic consists of a giant ice cap floating on the ocean in the winter months. Ice conditions along the coastline vary dramatically by season and are also variable and unpredictable from year to year. The Arctic marine environment is fragile, slow to change, and easy to disturb. It is very sensitive to the effects of climate change and human activities. Marine protected areas can play an important role in maintaining this unique ecosystem and traditional ways of life.
A Case Study: Ninginganiq, Akpait and Qaqulluit National Wildlife Areas
These three National Wildlife Areas on the northeast coast of Baffin Island were identified as part of the Inuit Impact and Benefit Agreement for National Wildlife Areas and Migratory Bird Sanctuaries in the Nunavut Settlement Area. The Agreement is a collaborative effort between the Inuit of the Nunavut Settlement Area and the Government of Canada under the authority of the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement.
As required by these agreements, co-management committees will be established for the National Wildlife Areas to advise the federal Minister of Environment on all aspects of planning and management for the areas. Co-management ensures that both the traditional knowledge and expertise of the Inuit and the best scientific data are combined effectively in all decision-making processes.
Together, the three National Wildlife Areas cover 4534 square kilometres and will provide the opportunity to protect unique and important wildlife species and their habitat, including:
- one of the largest bowhead whale concentrations in Canada, a species of special concern (Ninginganiq National Wildlife Area);
- one of Canada's largest thick-billed murre colonies (Akpait National Wildlife Area); and
- Canada's largest colony of northern fulmars, as well as other marine animals such as walruses and ring seals (Qaqulluit National Wildlife Area).
Pacific
Unlike the Arctic and Atlantic oceans, sea ice is generally absent from the Pacific. This, combined with relatively uniform ocean temperatures and nutrient-rich water flow, results in a high level of biodiversity. Marine invertebrate diversity in the region is particularly rich—some 3800 species— and represents about 3.5% of the world's marine invertebrates. The large invertebrate populations provide a rich food base for fish, marine mammals and other sea life.
A Case Study: The SGaan Kinghlas-Bowie Seamount Marine Protected Area
The SGaan Kinghlas-Bowie Seamount Marine Protected Area encompasses a series of three offshore submarine volcanoes. The Bowie is the shallowest seamount in Canada's Pacific waters and one of Earth's most biologically rich submarine volcanoes. It rises froma depth of 3000 metres to within 24 metres of the surface. It is a rare habitat in the northeast Pacific Ocean, situated about 180 kilometres offshore of Haida Gwaii (the Queen Charlotte Islands).
To the Haida Nation, the indigenous people who live on Haida Gwaii, the submarine volcanoes are known as SGaan Kinghlas or ""supernatural being looking outward"". The area has long been recognized by the Haida Nation as a special and protected place.
A Memorandum of Understanding between the Department of Fisheries and Oceans and the Council of the Haida Nation was developed to confirm the commitment to cooperative management and planning of this Oceans Act Marine Protected Area. This demonstrates the shared goal of both parties to protect and conserve SGaan Kinghlas-Bowie Seamount for present and future generations.
A Case Study: Checleset Bay Ecological Reserve
In the 1960s, a small group of biologists became concerned that the sea otter was disappearing from British Columbia's coasts. In an attempt to save the sea otter, these scientists identified a habitat in Checleset Bay on the west coast of Vancouver Island that would be an ideal site for relocation of the animal. The sea otter was subsequently re-introduced to the area from Alaska in the early 1970s. Not only did the sea otter population flourish, but the kelp/urchin/sea otter ecological relationships that had once characterized the west coast of North America were restored.
The successful relocation effort led the province of British Columbia to establish the Checleset Bay Ecological Reserve. The main purposes of the reserve are to protect and support sea otter ecosystems and provide scientific research opportunities in marine ecology. Much of the reserve is now closed to commercial or recreational harvesting of marine life through complementary fisheries management initiatives.
Atlantic
The richness of the Atlantic Ocean lured early Europeans to settle along its coastline as far back as the 16th century. The Grand Banks, to the east of Newfoundland, are among the most biologically productive marine areas in the world. The confluence of the Labrador Current and the Gulf Stream, together with tidal mixing in the shallow waters of the continental shelf, provide ideal feeding and spawning conditions for a wide variety of species. As one moves east from the vast continental shelf, the Atlantic becomes defined by deep water.
A Case Study: Saguenay–St. Lawrence Marine Park
The Saguenay–St. Lawrence Marine Park is a representative example of the exceptional geographical and oceanographic environment at the confluence of the Saguenay Fjord and the St. Lawrence River. It was created to protect a habitat deemed essential to a threatened local population of beluga whales. Jointly established and managed by Canada and Quebec, the 1245 square kilometre marine park was formally established under both federal and provincial legislation in 1998.
This is the first park in Quebec to exclusively protect a marine environment. The Saguenay–St. Lawrence Marine Park is an important habitat for more than 11 species of whales and seals and a variety of seabirds and sea ducks. It has a rich and colourful diversity of marine fish and invertebrates that is enjoyed by kayakers, boaters and divers alike.
A Case Study:Witless Bay Ecological Reserve
The Witless Bay Ecological Reserve includes four islands—Gull, Green, Great and Pee Pee—that teem with life during the seabird breeding season. The islands lie just a few kilometres off the east coast of Newfoundland's Avalon Peninsula. Together they provide breeding habitat for the largest Atlantic puffin colony in North America (>260 000 pairs), the second largest Leach's storm-petrel colony in the world (>600 000 pairs), as well as eight other seabird species. The Reserve also includes a one-kilometremarine zone around the islands, and a two-kilometre corridor between Green Island and Great Island.
The rich diversity of marine life, combined with the offshore islands found in the Witless Bay Ecological Reserve, provide ideal nesting and feeding habitats for seabirds. Capelin, a small smelt-sized schooling fish, forms the backbone of this marine food web. Many species, including cod,whales and seabirds, follow the migration ofmassive schools of capelin on the way to their shallow coastal spawning beaches. The abundance of fish that first attracted Europeans to these coastal waters continues to attract internationally significant populations of whales and seabirds today.
In recognition of the significance and sensitivity of these seabird colonies, the islands were first protected as a Seabird Sanctuary in 1964. The Witless Bay Ecological Reserve was established in 1983 under the provincial Wilderness and Ecological Reserves Act (1983) and Seabird Ecological Reserve Regulations. Regulations govern the operation of boats inside the reserve during the sensitive nesting season from April 1 to September 1; commercial fishing is permitted. A Seabird Ecological Reserve Advisory Committee provides recommendations to the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador onmanagement of Witless Bay Ecological Reserve and other seabird ecological reserves in the provincial protected areas system.
A Case Study: The Gully Marine Protected Area
Canada's Gully is an immense underwater canyon, approximately 200 kilometres off the Nova Scotia coast. It is the largest canyon on the east coast of North America—and so vast and deep that it shapes the ocean currents.
The Gully is one of the most prominent undersea features on the east coast of Canada. This is where the seafloor suddenly drops away into a large and deep submarine valley formed thousands of years ago. More than 65 kilometres long, 15 kilometres wide and two kilometres deep, the Gully's ecosystem includes shallow sandy banks, the deep-water canyon environment, and portions of the continental slope and abyssal plain.
The Gully is recognized around the world as an exceptional environment that provides habitat for a wide range of species. It has significant coral communities, a diversity of both shallow and deep-water fishes, and a variety of whales and dolphins. A resident population of northern bottlenose whales are among the world's deepest divers andmake regular trips to the canyon depths for food.
This Oceans Act Marine Protected Area has three management zones that provide varying levels of protection based on conservation objectives and ecological sensitivities. An ecosystem approach has been applied to the design of the Marine Protected Area so that human activities are assessed against the ecosystem features being protected in the Gully. The regulations also control human activities outside the Gully that could cause harmful effects within the Marine Protected Area boundary.
Fisheries and Oceans Canada works with government partners, industry, non-governmental organizations, the scientific community and other interested groups in the management and conservation of this exceptional marine area.
The Great Lakes
Although the Great Lakes are not marine in the strict sense of the word, they have been described as ""freshwater seas"" because of their size. At 245 000 square kilometres they are the world's largest freshwater lake system, displaying many of the same attributes as true marine environments. Canada and the United States both have jurisdiction over portions of the Great Lakes, so their respective protected area programs contribute to the overall health of the Great Lakes ecosystems.
A Case Study: The Lake Superior National Marine Conservation Area
Ontario and Canada agreed to establish the Lake Superior National Marine Conservation Area in October 2007. Located near Thunder Bay, Ontario, it is the world's largest freshwater protected area with a surface area of over 10 000 square kilometres. It covers about one third of the Canadian portion of Lake Superior and extends to the Canada-United States border.
More than 70 species of fish inhabit the near-pristine waters of Lake Superior, the largest of the Great Lakes. Gulls, herons, eagles, and pelicans feed in these waters, and use island habitats for breeding. There are an estimated 50 shipwrecks within the Lake Superior NationalMarine Conservation Area. One of these wrecks, the Gunilda,was described as the most beautiful in the world by Jacques Cousteau. The area boasts many other attractions related to geology, geomorphology, as well as unique flora and fauna. Aboriginal presence in this area dates back at least 5000 years and continues to the present day.
Getting Involved in Protecting Our Oceans
- On June 8, World Oceans Day, celebrate by sharing your passion, discoveries, pictures, research, stories and culture about the oceans with family, friends and children.
- Inform yourself and help others learn about the importance of Canada's oceans.
- Protect sensitive aquatic ecosystems in your area by cleaning up garbage from beaches, streams, rivers or wetlands.
- Use natural pest controls on your lawn or garden. Use biodegradable cleaners for all cleaning jobs. Practice the 3 R's and reduce, re-use, and recycle all your cans, paper, plastic, and glass products – everything flows to the sea!
- When boating or visiting a shoreline, always take all of your waste away with you for proper disposal and recycling.
- Help control the spread of invasive species by cleaning your boats, being diligent about ballast water, and not releasing live bait.
- Keep informed and get involved in local groups and initiatives that help to protect and conserve our oceans and waterways.
- Help fight climate change impacts on the oceans – ride a bike or use public transit and encourage your friends and family to do the same.
All of these actions, however small, can make a difference.
Marine protected areas – the way forward
This report highlights existing marine protected areas, which collectively protect 1% of Canada's oceans and Great Lakes. Many additional sites are currently under study or are in the process of being established, such as the proposed Gwaii Haanas National Marine Conservation Area Reserve and Haida Heritage Site. Progress in recent years can also be measured in terms of initial financial investments; advice acquired from national and international marine protected area practitioners and ecosystem scientists; establishment of processes, partnerships and governance structures; and policy development. With all this in place as a foundation, we are well poised to move ahead with additional marine protected area establishment in Canada.Footnote 1
There is widespread international agreement on the need for networks of marine protected areas to help restore and maintain the health of our oceans. A network is a set of complementary and ecologically linked marine protected areas in a particular region. Effective networks protect examples of ecosystems or habitat types in a region, as well as special or unique areas. Marine protected area networks can contribute to sustainable development goals by fostering integrated ocean and coastal management through three inter-related functions and benefits:
- Ecological – A network can help maintain functional marine ecosystems and their associated biodiversity.
- Social – A network can help resolve and manage conflicts in the use of natural resources, and provide opportunities for research and education.
- Economical – A network can facilitate the efficient use of financial and human resources.
The Government of Canada, in collaboration with provincial and territorial partners, is leading the development and implementation of a national network of marine protected areas for Canada's oceans and Great Lakes. The next report on marine protected areas in Canada will highlight progress made in establishing the network, using the information in this report as the starting point. Network planning will take into consideration the protection provided by other management tools not covered here, such as certain fisheries closures. It will be situated within Canada's integrated approach to oceans management, for the long-term health of our marine environment and all that depends upon it.

- . Atlantic Walrus in the Nunavut Settlement Area
Foreword
The purpose of this Integrated Fisheries Management Plan (IFMP) is to identify the objectives and requirements for the Atlantic walrus (Odobenus rosmarus rosmarus) fishery in the Nunavut Settlement Area, and the management measures that will be used to achieve these objectives. This document also serves to communicate the basic information on the fishery and its management to Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) staff, legislated co-management boards, Hunters and Trappers Associations (HTOs), Regional Wildlife Boards (RWOs), Inuit, communities and other stakeholders. This IFMP provides a common understanding of the basic “rules” for the sustainable management of the fisheries resource.
This IFMP is not a legally binding instrument which can form the basis of a legal challenge. The IFMP can be modified at any time and does not fetter the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans’ discretionary powers set out in the Fisheries Act. The Minister can, for reasons of conservation or for any other valid reasons, modify any provision of the IFMP in accordance with the powers granted pursuant to the Fisheries Act, and subject to the relevant terms of the Nunavut Agreement.
Where DFO is responsible for implementing obligations for any land claims agreements, the IFMP will be implemented in a manner consistent with these obligations. In the event that an IFMP is inconsistent with obligations under land claims agreements, the provisions of the land claims agreements will prevail to the extent of the inconsistency.

1. Overview
The following is an Integrated Fisheries Management Plan (IFMP) that will be used to provide direction in the management of Atlantic walrus (Odobenus rosmarus rosmarus) stocks in the Nunavut Settlement Area (NSA). Walrus in the Areas of Equal Use and Occupancy, as set out in Schedule 40-1 of the Nunavut Agreement (NA), will continue to be managed under applicable Acts, Regulations and land claims agreements, and are currently excluded from the management structure identified within this IFMP.
This IFMP was developed and will be implemented by the Government of Canada and co-management organizations through an adaptive co-management process. Working Groups comprised of Hunters and Trappers Organizations (HTO) from Arctic Bay, Grise Fiord, Hall Beach, Igloolik, Pond Inlet and Resolute, Qikiqtaaluk Wildlife Board (QWB), Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated (NTI), the Nunavut Wildlife Management Board (NWMB) and the Department of Fisheries & Oceans (DFO) were formed to lead the development of the IFMP. The Working Groups have been instrumental in the development of the IFMP.
1.1 History
The walrus is one of the largest members of the seal family with two subspecies recognised. Pacific walrus inhabit the Bering, Chukchi, and Laptev seas. Atlantic walrus inhabit coastal areas of north-eastern Canada, Greenland and Svalbard (NAMMCO 2004).
Walrus have been harvested by Arctic indigenous peoples for thousands of years, providing valuable products such as blubber, bones, tusks and meat. The commercial harvesting of walrus in the 19th and 20th centuries resulted in a rapid decrease of walrus across their Arctic ranges, including the extirpation of the Northwest Atlantic population. By 1928, commercial harvesting of walrus was banned in Canada by the Walrus Protection Regulations. Currently walrus in the NSA are managed under the Marine Mammal Regulations, the Fisheries Act and the NA.
Walrus are a key species in the Arctic marine food web, are of high economic, social and cultural importance for Inuit, and are iconic to Canadians since they are so easily identified with the Arctic environment.
1.2 Type of Fishery and Participants
Atlantic walrus are primarily harvested by Inuit, and are highly valued as a traditional source of food and other products. The Inuit hunt provides an opportunity to maintain cultural traditions and for experienced hunters to pass on their skills and knowledge to younger generations. Walrus products also provide a secondary source of income for hunters. Walrus ivory is either sold raw, or carved into fine art pieces such as jewelry or sculptures. Some communities engage in a small-scale sport hunt conducted by non-Inuit hunters.
1.3 Location of the Fishery
Atlantic walrus are found across most of Nunavut, with the majority of harvests occurring in eastern Nunavut (Figure 1).
1.4 Governance
The walrus fishery in the NSA is co-managed by DFO, the NWMB, RWOs and HTOs, in accordance with the Nunavut Agreement (NA or Agreement), and the Fisheries Act and its regulations. Under this co-management regime, the NWMB is the main instrument of wildlife management in the NSA, but the Minister retains authority and ultimate responsibility for wildlife management and conservation of fish, including marine mammals.
Fisheries Act, regulations, and policies
The walrus fishery is regulated by the Fisheries Act (R.S., 1985, c. F-14) and regulations made pursuant to it, including the Fishery (General) Regulations and the Marine Mammal Regulations. Where there is an inconsistency between the regulations and the Agreement, the Agreement shall prevail to the extent of the inconsistency.
DFO has adopted a Sustainable Fisheries Framework for all Canadian fisheries to ensure that objectives for long-term sustainability, economic prosperity, and improved governance for Canadian fisheries are met. The Sustainable Fisheries Framework contains policies for adopting an ecosystem based approach to fisheries management, including A Fishery Decision-Making Framework Incorporating the Precautionary Approach, and Managing Impacts of Fishing on Benthic Habitat, Communities and Species. This policy framework applies to the walrus fishery in the Nunavut Settlement Area.
These documents are available on the Internet at:
/reports-rapports/regs/sff-cpd/overview-cadre-eng.htm
Nunavut Agreement
In 1993, Canada settled a comprehensive land claim agreement with the Inuit of the NSA. The NA created priority access and wildlife harvesting rights for Inuit and other Aboriginal groups who traditionally harvested within the NSA.
The NA also created an Institution of Public Government, the NWMB, to share decision making authority with the Federal Government. The NWMB and DFO Minister consider matters relating to the proper management and control of fisheries and the conservation of fish within the NSA. Under this co-management regime, the NWMB is the main instrument of wildlife management, but the Minister retains ultimate responsibility for wildlife management and may accept, reject or vary decisions made by the NWMB with respect to harvesting and other decisions related to the management and protection of wildlife and wildlife habitat.
The NA establishes wildlife management authority for the NWMB including the establishment, modification, and removal of levels of Total Allowable Harvest (TAH) or harvesting in the NSA, as well as Non-Quota Limitations (NQLs) on harvesting such as management units and harvesting seasons. Once a total allowable harvest has been established, the NWMB is also required to strike a Basic Needs Level (BNL), which is the portion of the TAH allocated to Inuit that constitutes the first demand on the TAH. Once established for a stock or population, the TAH replaces the existing regulatory quota.
The NL establishes wildlife management authority for RWOs and HTOs. The powers and functions of the RWOs (NA 5.7.6) include:
- Regulation of harvesting practices and techniques among the members of HTOs in the region, including the use of non-quota limitations.
- Allocation and enforcement of regional basic needs levels and adjusted basic needs levels among HTOs in the region.
- Assignment to any person or body other than an HTO, with or without valuable consideration and conditions, of any portion of regional basic needs levels and adjusted basic needs levels.
- Generally, the management of harvesting among the members of HTOs in the region.
The powers and functions of the HTOs (NA 5.7.3) include:
- Regulation of harvesting practices and techniques among the members, including the use of non-quota limitations.
- Allocation and enforcement of community basic needs levels and adjusted basic needs levels among members.
- Assignment to non-members, with or without valuable consideration and conditions, of any portion of community basic needs levels and adjusted basic needs levels.
- Generally, the management of harvesting among the members.
The NA establishes authority to Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated (NTI) as the primary Designated Inuit Organizations (DIO) under the Agreement. It is responsible for ensuring that Inuit rights and obligations under the land claim are implemented, including the wildlife management provisions (Article 5) of the NA.
Under the NA, wildlife management and Inuit harvesting are guided by the principles of conservation (NA s.5.1.5).

1.5 Fishery Characteristics
In Nunavut, Atlantic walrus are harvested year round. Inuit hunters use a combination of modern equipment, such as snowmobiles, boats with outboard motors, and rifles, as well as traditional sleds, harpoons and floats. Typically, walrus are hunted from boats when they are on ice floes or while they are swimming in open water. In most cases walrus are shot first and then harpooned. Hunters prefer to kill walrus on ice where they are easier to retrieve and process. Animals on the ice are shot from close range with the intention of killing them immediately before they can fall into the water. Loss rates can be high when walrus are killed in deep water because they sink quickly (NAMMCO 2004, COSEWIC 2006). To reduce losses, animals in the water may be harpooned before they are shot, wounded so they can be harpooned before being killed, or killed in shallow water where they can be retrieved with grappling hooks or at low tide (NAMMCO 2004, COSEWIC 2006). Harpooning a walrus is dangerous, since animals must be approached to within 10m and wounded walrus become very aggressive and can capsize canoes or small boats (COSEWIC 2006). Floats made from seal skin are still heavily used, although hunters are finding that modern floats are more durable.
Some communities conduct walrus sport hunts. Individuals hunting under the authority of a marine mammal fishing licence issued by DFO must travel with local guides approved by the HTO. The licence stipulates when and where the hunt is authorized to take place, by whom, their country of origin, quotas, gear type to be used, as well as any specific conditions related to the hunt, such as the reporting of all hunts to the local DFO office, firearm muzzle velocity requirements, and the total number of strikes allowed. Individual HTOs may also have local by-laws. Licenced sport hunters report harvest information directly to DFO. See section 6 and Appendix 3 for more information on walrus sport hunts.

It will be reviewed and amended as necessary in collaboration with co-management organizations to ensure it remains relevant and current with new science, Traditional Ecological Knowledge and Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit.
This IFMP will be translated to Inuktitut and made available from DFO.
2. Stock Assessment, Science and Traditional Knowledge
2.1 Biological Synopsis
The walrus is Canada's largest member of the seal family. It is a large animal with limbs that have developed into flippers, upper canine teeth that develop into long tusks (ivory) at about 2 years of age, and a moustache made of quill-like whiskers. Males and females are about 125 cm long at birth. As adults, males are significantly larger than females (Garlich-Miller & Stewart 1998). Adult males reach up to 1,100 kg in weight and 3.1 m in length and females can reach 800 kg and 2.8 m in length. Walrus can live to 40 years of age, and are considered to be long-lived animals. As walrus have a delayed sexual maturation, fairly low reproductive rates and specialized habitat requirements, they are vulnerable to over-harvesting and sensitive to environmental changes (COSEWIC 2006).
Mating occurs from February to April. Little is known about their reproduction because they mate in the water and in remote areas. Males mature between 7 and 13 years of age and compete intensely for females, defending access to them for up to five days. Females mature between 5 and 10 years of age and give birth on average every three years. Gestation lasts about 11 months and the young nurse for up to 27 months. Expectant mothers move onto land or ice to give birth. Protective care by mothers and the herd assures high calf survival (DFO 2007).
2.2 Ecosystem Interactions
The habitat requirements of the Atlantic walrus are very specific. They need large areas of shallow (100 m or less), open water that support an abundant clam community. In addition, there must be ice or land nearby to ‘haul out’. Moving pack ice is ideal for this purpose; however, in the summer and fall if ice is scarce, large herds congregate and haul out on low, rocky shores with steep subtidal zones. In areas of deeper water without plentiful clams, some walrus will consume seals. These walrus tend to be more aggressive, and are usually solitary or found in smaller groups. Although some hauled out groups of walrus may contain animals of all ages and both sexes, walrus tend to segregate by age and sex during most of the year. It is thought that females and their young return to certain sites more faithfully than do adult males (DFO 2007). Following harvesting by humans, polar bears are thought to be the main predators of walrus, though it is believed they take few animals.
The full effects of climate change on Atlantic walrus are unknown. However, potential effects of a warming climate may include, but are not limited to:
- A reduction in winter and summer ice cover
- A rise in sea level
- An increase in sediment transport
- An increase in the frequency and severity of storms
- An increase in the presence of killer whales in the Arctic.
These may all be important factors for walrus, potentially impacting food supply and/or quality, ecosystem interactions, affecting their ability to access food and appropriate haulout sites, thereby influencing their health, distribution and abundance. These affects could also impact hunters’ ability to access walrus.
2.3 Traditional Ecological Knowledge
Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) of walrus throughout Canada’s Arctic is extensive. Each community has hunters and elders that have knowledge in areas of distribution, seasonality, migration, birthing areas and haulout sites. Inuit have observed changes with respect to impacts from climate change, past and present disturbances and development/exploration. When shared, this information is considered with scientific knowledge to provide a more robust understanding of walrus distribution, movements and environmental interactions. TEK has also been used in assisting with the delineation of stocks and is used in the design of surveys by DFO Science to estimate population abundance. TEK is used with scientific data and observations to contribute to management decisions, as well as to identify information gaps, areas of uncertainty, and to set research priorities.
TEK has been recorded on unpublished maps, in meetings minutes, documented in a number of different published papers (DFO 2002a, DFO 2012a, NCRI 2014), and through consultations with experienced hunters and community elders.
Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit (IQ) consists of TEK, as well as Inuit beliefs about how the world works, and the values necessary to behave in an ethical manner in human interactions with the animals and the environment. The collaborative approach to developing this IFMP for walrus that includes representatives from HTOs and other co-management organizations has assisted in the inclusion of IQ, such as decision-making through consensus, working together for a common cause, and respect and care for the land, environment and animals (NWMB). This IFMP will allow for the continued inclusion of IQ, TEK and science as it becomes available.
2.4 Stock Delineation
Two populations of walrus have been identified in Canada based on analysis of microsatellite DNA (Shafer et al. 2013): the high Arctic population (comprised of the West Jones Sound, Baffin Bay and Penny Strait-Lancaster Sound stocks) and the central Arctic population (including the north and central Foxe Basin stocks and the Hudson Bay-Davis Strait stocks).
There are a number of factors used in delineating stocks, including ecological factors that determine distribution of walrus (ice cover, polynyas, shallow banks with suitable habitat, migration routes and availability of haulout sites), historical and current distribution, seasonal movements, age and sex composition, catch levels, composition of catches and hunting loss, hunter observations, harvest sites, survey observations, genetic information, satellite tagging data, heavy metal/ organochlorine data, lead isotope ratios and trace elements (Stewart 2008b).
Based on consultations with local communities, stock reassessment by the North Atlantic Marine Mammal Commission (NAMMCO) (2011), and Stewart (2008a), six stocks or management units of Atlantic walrus have been identified for management purposes in the NSA (Figure 2).
These include:
- Baffin Bay- Management Unit AW-01 (shared with Greenland);
- West Jones Sound- Management Unit AW-02;
- Penny Strait-Lancaster Sound- Management Unit AW-03;
- Foxe Basin- Management Unit AW-04;
- Hudson Bay- Davis Strait- Management Unit AW-05 (shared with Nunavik and Greenland);
- South and East Hudson Bay- Management Unit AW-06 (shared with Nunavik).
Note: This version of the IFMP does not apply to the Areas of Equal Use and Occupancy as set out in Schedule 40-1 ofthe Nunavut Agreement.
2.5 Precautionary Approach
A precautionary approach to fisheries management links harvest level recommendations with stock assessment data. Lower harvest levels are recommended when stock assessments are uncertain to avoid serious harm to fish or marine mammal stocks or their ecosystem. A lack of stock assessment data should not be used as a reason to postpone, or fail to take, management actions. This approach is widely accepted as an essential part of sustainable fisheries management.
In accordance with the Fisheries Act and the NA, the best available information guides walrus management decisions made on behalf of the NWMB and the Minister. A management decision to restrict Inuit harvesting shall do so only to the extent necessary to affect a valid conservation purpose; to give effect to the allocation system outlined in the NA; or to provide for public health or public safety (NA s. 5.3.3).
The amount of information available for resource management varies among species and populations. For those species where information on abundance, mortality and reproductive rates may be limited, DFO uses the Potential Biological Removal (PBR) method to estimate the maximum number of animals that may be removed by all human activities without depleting the stock or population (DFO 2012b). This total amount of removals accounted for using PBR would include removals of harvested animals, animals shot at, but not harvested (called struck and lost), as well as losses to ship strikes, net entanglements and any other human activities. The PBR is calculated using a number of biological parameters (Stewart 2008b, Stewart and Hamilton 2013).
In calculating sustainable harvest levels, PBR results are multiplied by a Loss Rate (LR) to obtain Total Allowable Landed Catch (TALC) values. Loss rates represent all indirect human caused mortalities (struck and lost, ship strikes, net entanglements). At this time, only struck and lost rates are considered in the estimate of TALC; however, this may change if more information becomes available.
TALC = PBR (1- LR)
Struck and lost rates are incomplete for walrus and can vary with season, weather, location, hunter experience, hunting technique/equipment, and animal behavior. In Canada, struck and lost rates have been documented to range between 30% and 32% (Orr et. al 1986), although some hunters believe the rates to be as low as 5% (DFO 2002a). Inuit harvesters have noted that loss rates will vary depending on when and how the walrus is harvested. NAMMCO applies a struck and lost rate of 30% for those stocks lacking specific loss rate information (2006).
2.6 Stock Assessment and Trends
Most indicators of trends in stock size are based on distributional changes, differences in physical conditions of the animal, and harvest data. Whenever there is a local decrease in numbers, it may be that the animals have moved to another area, but until increases in other parts of the range have been clearly documented, the possibility of a reduction in numbers should be considered.
Walrus are widely distributed in the eastern Canadian Arctic, and are most often found in aggregations, or groups, numbering from the tens, to thousands. In order to estimate walrus numbers, aerial surveys are conducted of walrus haulouts. Walrus haulouts are identified based on a number of factors including information from past surveys, existing scientific information, and local traditional knowledge. Data from satellite tags active during surveys are used to adjust the haulout counts to account for animals at sea, and therefore missed by the survey. If no active tags are in the survey area at the time of the survey, data from other walrus studies are used to estimate the numbers of walrus at sea, and determine an abundance estimate. Although aerial surveys combined with satellite telemetry are the standard methods used to estimate abundance of walrus populations across their range, new approaches, such as genetic capture-mark-recapture methods, should be investigated.
The most recent science advisory report on walrus abundance estimates can be found at:

INUKTITUT:http://waves-vagues.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/Library/350373_inu.pdf; and http://waves-vagues.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/Library/365442inu.pdf
Baffin Bay (BB) - Management Unit AW-01
In Canada, the Baffin Bay stock extends from eastern Jones Sound to eastern Ellesmere Island and NW Greenland (Stewart 2008a). Analysis of aerial surveys conducted by DFO and Greenland Institute of Natural Resources in 1999, 2005, and 2009 resulted in population abundance estimates ranging from 1,249 to 1,251 and PBR estimates to range from 10 to 11 walrus (DFO 2013, Stewart et al. 2013a, Stewart and Hamilton 2013). See Figure 2.
West Jones Sound (WJS) - Management Unit AW-02
This stock is separated from the Baffin Bay stock by seasonal distribution and tag movements (Stewart 2008a). Aerial surveys by DFO were conducted between 1998 and 2009, resulting in an abundance estimate ranging from 470 to 503, and PBR estimates ranging from 7 to 17 animals (DFO 2013, Stewart et al. 2013b, Stewart and Hamilton 2013). There was no statistically significant evidence of population change between these surveys and the late 1970s, but there were differences in coverage and walrus distribution may have changed. See Figure 2.
Penny Strait- Lancaster Sound (PS/LS) - Management Unit AW-03
This stock is separated from the Baffin Bay stock by isotope data, and from the West Jones Sound stock by distribution and tag movements (Stewart 2008a). Aerial surveys were conducted between 1998 and 2008 and resulted in an abundance estimate of 727 walrus in 2009 and PBR estimates ranging from 10 to 24 animals (DFO 2013, Stewart et al. 2013b, Stewart and Hamilton 2013). There was no statistically significant evidence of a trend in population numbers when the recent surveys were compared to similar surveys in the late 1970s, although differences in coverage and possible changes in walrus distribution may influence comparisons. See Figure 2.
Foxe Basin (FB) - Management Unit AW-04
Stewart (2008b) delineated the Foxe Basin stock into 2 units: northern Foxe Basin stock and central Foxe Basin stock. In Foxe Basin, the two stocks share an overwintering area and breed as a single unit, but they may occupy different areas in the summer and may be susceptible to different hunting pressures. Lead isotope ratios and trace element profiles from teeth suggest two different stocks, and since isotope ratios are a reflection of the migratory patterns of the animals, they are useful in discriminating management units. Although there is evidence to delineate two stocks in the Foxe Basin area, currently there is not enough information (science or TEK) to visually or geographically separate the stocks within the larger Foxe Basin area. Therefore, until additional information is available to further partition this stock, the management of walrus will continue to occur at the larger Foxe Basin management unit. See Figure 2.
Analysis of surveys conducted in 2010 and 2011 resulted in a range of abundance estimates of 8,153-13,452 and PBR estimates ranging from 211-422 walrus (DFO 2016, Stewart et al. 2013c, Stewart and Hamilton 2013).
Changes in the distribution of walrus within Foxe Basin have been documented by local hunters and researchers, with many haulouts being abandoned on the west coast (Mansfield 1966, Brody 1976, Anderson and Garlich-Miller 1994, DFO 2002a). This may suggest declines in numbers of walrus, habitat availability, or both. Local Inuit have noted that ice conditions have changed in Foxe Basin resulting in a reduction of multiyear ice that walrus use for hauling out on.
Hudson Bay-Davis Strait (HBDS)- Management Unit AW-05
Walrus from the Hudson Bay-Davis Strait (HBDS) stock have been distinguished from the other five stocks based on distances, movements, differences in growth patterns, as well as differences in genetics, contaminants, and lead isotope ratios (DFO 2002b, COSEWIC 2006, Stewart 2008a). A comprehensive, systematic survey over the entire geographic area has not occurred for this stock. Currently, due to the limited amount of data over the stock’s full range, it is not possible to determine the size or trend of this stock. See Figure 2.
South and East Hudson Bay (SEHB)- Management Unit AW-06
The South and East Hudson Bay walrus stock was originally delineated by Born et al. (1995) on the basis of distribution, but since then, lead isotope data has provided stronger evidence that supports the differentiation between this stock and the Hudson Bay-Davis Strait stock (Stewart 2008a). A complete or comprehensive survey of this stock has not been conducted. Based on a few walrus sightings in a large geographical area over a long period of time, Richard and Campbell (1988) and Born et al. (1995) estimated the population size to be a minimum of 410 and 500 animals, respectively (COSEWIC 2006). Currently, due to the limited amount of data, it is not possible to determine the size or trend of this stock. See Figure 2.
|Population||Stock/Management Unit||Abundance Estimates||PBR|
|High Arctic||Baffin Bay (BB)/ AW-01||1249-1251||10-11|
|West Jones Sound (WJS)/ AW-02||470-503||8-17|
|Penny Strait- Lancaster Sound (PS-LS)/ AW-03||623-831||12-24|
|Central Arctic||Foxe Basin/ AW-04||8,153-13,452||211-422|
|Hudson Bay-Davis Strait/ AW-05||No recent estimate.||---|
|Unknown||South and East Hudson Bay/ AW-06||No recent estimate.||---|
(Stewart and Hamilton 2013, DFO 2013, DFO 2016)
PBR represents the total number of animals that can be removed from all human activities while allowing the stock or population to maintain or achieve its optimal sustainable level.
2.7 Research
The following research is required:
- Determine abundance estimates for Hudson Bay-Davis Strait and South and East Hudson Bay stocks;
- Apply new methods to determine walrus abundance, such as genetic capture-mark-recapture;
- Continue to research genetic diversity and stock discrimination;
- Continue to investigate and assess potential threats resulting from human activities (e.g., shipping routes, noise disturbance, tourism);
- Determine the extent of exchange between shared Canada/Greenland stocks;
- Determine changes in habitat availability (pack ice and food); and
- Continue to investigate distribution and abundance of stocks.
3. Social, Cultural and Economic Importance of the Fishery
For centuries, walrus have been used by Inuit as a traditional food source and for supplying important materials for day to day living. Walrus meat is eaten in raw, cooked or fermented (igunak) forms by Inuit. Molluscs found in walrus stomachs are considered a delicacy in some Inuit communities (Whitford 2008). Some communities now obtain their walrus meat and tusks from hunters in other communities rather than conduct their own hunts (DFO 2012a).
Historically, walrus products provided materials for numerous necessities required for arctic living such as bones used for carvings, tent poles, and walking sticks, tusks/ ivory used to construct harpoons, toggles, handles, and handicrafts, sinews used for sewing thread, and skin for tents and ropes. The tusk and baculum (penis bone) are valuable economic commodities and provide important sources of cash income, particularly, for the hunting communities. Ivory from walrus is commonly used for carvings and crafts and is sold both inside and outside the NSA. Although not as much trade occurs with walrus products as some other arctic species, international and domestic trade does still occur, mostly via exporters in southern Canada. International export of walrus products includes carved and un-carved tusks, bones, teeth, skeletons and skulls. International markets for Canadian walrus products include France, India, China, Japan, Korea, Singapore, United States and Australia (Shadbolt et. al 2014).
The walrus sport hunt in some communities can provide a major source of cash income through the hiring of local guides, and sport hunters purchasing various goods and services (food, crafts, and accommodations). Sport hunters are permitted to keep the tusks, baculum and head of the walrus, but the meat remains within the community for community use.
Hunting walrus, especially at traditional summer hunting camps, helps foster interdependence both within and between communities, provides opportunities to share knowledge between generations and community members and strengthens kinship ties and community cohesion. These cultural values are difficult to measure in economic terms but are very important to help maintain the Inuit way of life. The walrus hunt itself, as well as the sharing of the products of the hunt, continues to be of great social, cultural and economic significance to Inuit and the economic value of the meat and the ivory is substantial (COSEWIC 2006).
4. Management Issues
IFMPs are required to cover all aspects of a fishery, in particular, those areas that are related to the sustainability of the target species, ecosystem considerations and monitoring. The following represent the main management issues for the Atlantic walrus in the NSA.
4.1 Fisheries Issues
Abundance Estimates
While recent estimates are available for four of the six walrus stocks or management units, abundance estimates are still required for the Hudson Bay-Davis Strait stock and the South and East Hudson Bay stock. Funding for surveys will be needed to obtain abundance estimates and recommend sustainable harvest levels.
Sustainable Harvest Levels
It is important to ensure the conservation of walrus and that the harvesting of walrus is sustainable. There is growing national and international pressure to demonstrate that walrus are being harvested at sustainable levels. This will require the establishment of sustainable harvest levels for all stocks.
Struck and Lost Rates
Accurate struck and lost rates are important for understanding the impacts of hunting and to maximize sustainable harvest levels. Struck and lost rates vary or are incomplete in the NSA. Determining appropriate struck and lost rates are required in order to estimate sustainable harvest levels.
Hunter Training/ Reducing Loss Rates
Training for harvesters and youth has been identified as an important component for the sustainable management of the walrus fishery. This would include training on the best harvesting techniques, when and where to harvest, hunter safety, preparation and preservation of meat, and how to minimize struck and lost rates. HTOs may develop plans or best management practices that set out practical measures for community hunters to reduce the number of struck and lost walrus while harvesting.
Monitoring and Reporting
Once a TAH/BNL is established for walrus, a method to control removals will be required to ensure walrus harvesting remains within regulated harvest levels.
Timely, accurate reporting of walrus harvesting is essential. Without complete and accurate estimates of local harvesting activity, co-managers must exercise caution when recommending harvest limits so that vital, healthy walrus populations/stocks that are capable of sustaining harvesting needs of Inuit can be maintained. The timeliness of the reporting allows managers to assess the harvest as limits are approached.
Sport Hunt
There is a need for all HTOs that pursue sport hunt opportunities to develop by-laws or guidelines that would identify the community rules or best management practices for the sport hunt.
Ship Traffic/Development/Tourism
There are a number of potential impacts and threats to walrus and walrus habitat resulting from increased development and shipping activities. These could include increased oil spills, ship strikes, disruption of migration, avoidance of ecologically or biologically important areas (e.g. birthing, mating or feeding areas), noise disturbance and the introduction of alien or invasive species through activities such as ballast water exchange. Tourism is increasing in the Arctic and concern with increased disturbance to important walrus areas (e.g. haulouts) has been expressed.
4.2 Oceans and Habitat Considerations
Under the Health of the Oceans Initiative, Ecologically and Biologically Significant Areas (EBSAs) in the Eastern Arctic were identified (DFO 2011). Experts from Canadian federal departments, academics, Inuit organizations and various environmental non-government organizations having expertise in a number of different areas were involved. EBSAs are intended to identify areas that have high ecological or biological significance and are useful in assisting with management decisions.
The EBSAs were evaluated based on set criteria for marine biogeographic regions. Of the 41 EBSAs identified in the Eastern Arctic, 14 included walrus as a component contributing to the EBSA criteria. The ecological functions identified as being important for walrus included known distribution, presence of haulouts, migration corridors, presence of polynyas, calving areas and feeding grounds.
4.3 National and International Issues
Food Safety
Outbreaks of trichinosis have been reported in Nunavut over the years, most commonly from consuming meat that has been infected with a parasitic worm called Trichinella nativa, which lives inside the bodies of walrus and some other birds and mammals. The Government of Nunavut’s department of health has responsibilities around food safety within the Nunavut Settlement Area and have established programs to test walrus meat for the parasite that causes the disease. Harvesters are asked to contact their HTO or a Government of Nunavut Environmental Health Officer for additional information on the Nunavut Trichinosis Prevention Program.
COSEWIC and SARA
COSEWIC (Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada) is an independent committee of government and non-government experts that assesses and designates the status of wildlife species that may be in some danger of disappearing from Canada. COSEWIC uses a process based on science, Aboriginal Traditional Knowledge and community knowledge to assess the risk of extinction for wildlife species. Wildlife species that have been designated at risk by COSEWIC may then qualify for legal protection and recovery or management under the Species at Risk Act (SARA).
The Species at Risk Act is a federal Act that was created to prevent Canadian species and their distinct populations from becoming extirpated or extinct, to provide for the recovery of Extirpated, Endangered or Threatened species, and to encourage the management of Special Concern species to prevent them from becoming further at risk. In the case of species listed as Special Concern, a management plan must be created which outlines the actions required to help prevent the species from becoming further at risk. For Extirpated, Endangered and Threatened species, a Recovery Strategy and Action Plan are developed which outline exactly what will be done to help recover the species to a larger, “pre-harm” population size. For Extirpated, Endangered and Threatened species, SARA also provides legal protection of their critical habitats and prevents any harm to the species, except under certain circumstances.
In 2006, COSEWIC designated Atlantic walrus as a species of Special Concern. However, the species is scheduled to be reassessed by COSEWIC and while the ‘special concern’ designation for a single population of Atlantic walrus could remain, it could be replaced with a higher designation of risk or multiple populations with multiple at risk designations. Once assessed by COSEWIC the Government of Canada will follow an established process to determine whether or not to recommend listing the species under the Species at Risk Act. This process includes biological, social and economic assessments of possible listing scenarios, as well as consultation with co-management organizations, stakeholders and interested individuals.
This IFMP could help inform any SARA-compliant documents that would be required if walrus was added to the List of Wildlife Species at Risk on SARA.
CITES
The Atlantic walrus is listed on Appendix III of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). As such, anyone wishing to export walrus parts or derivatives from Canada must obtain an export permit from the Canadian CITES administration. A non-detriment finding (indicating that levels of export are not detrimental to the survival of the species in the wild) is not required for species on Appendix III of CITES.
In 2009 and 2012 the United States considered submitting a proposal to up-list walrus to Appendix II of CITES based on the lack of information around the management of the species (e.g. sustainable harvest levels) and population species information (e.g. population abundance estimates). If listed on Appendix II of CITES, a non-detrimental finding (NDF) decision from the DFO Scientific Authority would be required to obtain a CITES Export/Re-export permit to export walrus products internationally.
Shared Stocks: Nunavik
Harvesting of the Hudson Bay-Davis Strait and South and East Hudson Bay stocks occurs in both the Nunavut Settlement Area and Nunavik Marine Region. As there are no population abundance estimates for these two stocks, the existing regulatory regime and quotas identified in the Fisheries Act and the Marine Mammal Regulations, and provisions in the Nunavut Agreement and the Nunavik Inuit Land Claims Agreement would continue to apply.
Shared Stocks: Greenland
Some stocks of Atlantic walrus inhabit and are harvested in both Canadian and Greenland waters. As such, it is important that discussions on management and sustainable harvesting occur between the two countries.
5. Objectives
A number of objectives were established for the walrus fishery. Long term objectives guide the management of the fishery and may be categorized as stock conservation, ecosystem, shared stewardship and social, cultural and economic objectives. Each long term objective is supported by one or more short term objectives. Various co-management organizations may take the lead in developing specific actions to address certain objectives.

6. Access and Allocation
Upon ratification of the NA in 1993, all existing restrictions or quotas on the amount of wildlife that could be harvested within the NSA were retained and deemed to have been established by the NWMB.
6.1 Where a Total Allowable Harvest has not been established
Unless a TAH has been established, an individual Inuk may harvest up to four (4) walrus in a year without a licence (MMR s. 6(1) (c)), except where community quotas exist (MMR s.26). Annual quotas have been set for the communities of Coral Harbour (60), Sanikiluaq (10), Arctic Bay (10) and Clyde River (20).
6.1.1 Sport Hunt
Marine Mammal Fishing Licences may be issued for non-beneficiaries to participate in walrus sport hunts (MMR s.4) provided there is support from the local HTO and annual approval from the NWMB based on its Interim NWMB Sport Hunt Policy. Sport hunters must provide detailed harvest reporting directly to DFO. The full Walrus Sport Hunt Policy can be found in Appendix 3.
6.1.2 Harvest Reporting
Harvest information is provided by Inuit hunters to the HTOs, which is then relayed to DFO (MMR s. 17; Fisheries Act s. 61; NA s. 5.7.43). Appendix 1 provides information on annual quotas and landed catch for communities that have harvested walrus. These numbers are not corrected for hunting losses. A Fishery Officer will notify the community and HTO when the quota has been reached and will close the fishery (MMR s. 12, 26).
6.2 Where a Total Allowable Harvest has been established:
The NWMB is in the process of establishing Total Allowable Harvest (TAH) levels and Basic Needs Levels (BNL) for walrus. In 2013, the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans accepted the NWMB’s decision to establish the BNL for beluga, narwhal and walrus in the NSA to be equal to the levels of TAH for those species. Therefore, since the BNL is the first demand on the TAH, Inuit will always have the right to the entire TAH. RWOs and HTOs are responsible for allocating this BNL/TAH, as well as regulating harvesting practices and techniques among their members, including the use of NQLs.
Article 40 of the NA will be considered for other Inuit or aboriginal groups that may demonstrate traditional use of walrus in the NSA.
6.2.1 Total Allowable Harvests
Total Allowable Harvest levels have been established for the following stocks:
|Population||Stock/ Management Unit||Harvesting Community||TAH||Community Harvest Level|
|High Arctic||Baffin Bay /AW-01||Grise Fiord||To be established|
|West Jones Sound / AW-02||Grise Fiord||To be established|
|Penny Strait- Lancaster Sound /AW-03||Arctic Bay||To be established|
|Central Arctic||Foxe Basin / AW-04||Hall Beach||To be established|
Pond Inlet
Resolute
Igloolik
*see Figure 2 for a map of Atlantic walrus by stocks and management units.
6.2.2 Allocation of the TAH:
As identified in the NA, the RWOs will be responsible for allocating annual regional BNL, which in the case of walrus will be the TAH, to their respective community HTOs, regulating their members and fulfilling other wildlife co-management obligations in accordance with the NA. The community HTOs will be responsible for allocating and enforcing the community BNL (community harvest limit) among members, and generally the management of harvesting among members (see Figure 3).
Where a TAH has been established for a walrus management unit, the combined annual community harvest limits for that management unit shall not exceed the TAH.
6.2.3 Sport Hunt
An assignment under section 5.7.34 (b) of the NA is used to authorize walrus sport hunts to a person qualified to harvest walrus under the laws of general application. Under this section, a person authorized to harvest walrus under a licence may be assigned part or all of a share of the total allowable harvest by an Inuk, RWO or HTO. Through the assignment provisions, an Inuk, an HTO or a RWO may assign its share of the TAH to a walrus sport hunt, if so desired, so long as the established annual total allowable harvest for that particular management unit is not exceeded.
An assignment under Article 5 of the NA must be evidenced by documentation containing information on both the assignor, and the assignee. Once the required documentation is received by DFO, the Minister may issue a Walrus Marine Mammal Fishing Licence (MMR s.4). The full Walrus Sport Hunt Policy can be found in Appendix 3.
6.2.4 Post-Harvest Walrus Tag
For management units where a TAH has been established.
The Post-Harvest Walrus Tag is an important management tool for RWOs and HTOs to be able to allocate and account for harvesting among their members. Where a TAH has been established, DFO will issue Post-Harvest Walrus Tag to the RWO and/or HTOs in the amount equal to the annual harvest level for the corresponding management unit. Post-Harvest Walrus Tags will be allocated by the RWO/HTO and will be proof of allocation to a share of one walrus from the walrus TAH for a particular management unit. This forms part of the walrus management system in which RWOs and HTOs decide on community allocations, in the form of community harvest limits.
The Post-Harvest Walrus Tag is not a licence to hunt and will be issued without fee or administrative charge. A Walrus Harvest Tag system will assist in:
- Evidencing a person’s authority to harvest/possess wildlife appropriate to the particular Management Unit;
- Regulating the allocation of a share of TAH, including the BNL, as allocated by the RWO and/or HTO;
- Collecting information in relation to harvesting activities;
- Regulating harvesting activities in relation to sport hunt assignment.
6.2.5 Harvest Reporting and Monitoring
Hunters provide information on their hunts to their HTO. HTOs will provide the information to the RWO and DFO in a timely manner. A Fishery Officer will notify the community and HTOs when the harvest level has been reached for a management unit and will close the fishery (MMR s. 12, 26).
- Harvest information must be reported (MMR s. 17; Fisheries Act s. 61; NA s. 5.7.43):
7. Management Measures for the Duration of the Plan
The management measures identified in the IFMP outline the controls or rules adopted for the walrus fishery for the purposes of stock conservation and sustainable management. These measures are based on the Fisheries Act, the Marine Mammal Regulations and the NA.
The Marine Mammal Regulations (MMR) include provisions related to the hunting, movement, and sale of walrus products. These provisions include requirements for hunters to hunt a walrus in a manner that is designed to kill it quickly, to make reasonable efforts to retrieve a killed or wounded walrus without delay and to have all necessary equipment on hand to retrieve it. Abandoning, discarding or wasting edible parts of walrus is prohibited.
Domestic movement of walrus products requires a DFO Marine Mammal Transportation Licence. Indians or Inuit who land walrus in one jurisdiction and are returning to their home in another jurisdiction are exempted from this requirement. International trade of walrus products requires a CITES Export/Re-export Permit.
A full list of the management measures can be found in Appendix 2.
8. Shared Stewardship Arrangements
The Atlantic walrus IFMP was initiated and developed by the Foxe Basin Walrus Working Group in 2007 and the High Arctic-Baffin Bay Walrus Working Group in 2009. Participation on the Working Groups includes representatives from each of the HTOs, the Qikiqtaaluk Wildlife Board (co-chair), NTI and DFO. Staff from the NWMB have attended Working Group meetings when possible. The Working Groups invite subject-matter experts to provide additional information in the development of the IFMP as required. This has included representatives from the mining industry and community elders.
The Walrus Working Groups produced Terms of References to help guide the development of the IFMP. Meetings have been held in the communities of Resolute, Grise Fiord, Arctic Bay, Pond Inlet, Hall Beach and Igloolik to obtain the views of elders and community members on issues related to walrus management, including the identification of fishery issues and long and short term objectives for the fishery.
There are a number of different ways that the objectives for the fishery may be achieved, such as the effective implementation of the management measures identified in Appendix 2. Other measures may be initiated by co-management organizations through the development of by-laws or guidelines. Once developed, these would be included as an Appendix of the IFMP.
9. Compliance Plan
The Conservation and Protection program promotes and maintains compliance with legislation and regulations implemented to achieve the conservation and sustainable use of Canada’s aquatic resources, and the protection of species at risk, fish habitat and oceans. Conservation and Protection works closely with internal partners to evaluate risks to fish and fish habitat to ensure program delivery meets Departmental objectives.
Fishery Officers monitor fishing and related activities to ensure compliance with the Fisheries Act and its regulations as well as several other federal statutes. Fishery Officers investigate violations of these acts and regulations and resolve them by applying various compliance options.
Regional Compliance Program Delivery
Fishery Officers in the Eastern Arctic Area monitor the Atlantic walrus fishery and the trade of Atlantic walrus products for compliance with the MMR which are made pursuant to the Fisheries Act. Conservation and Protection works closely with internal and external partners to consult on and or resolve compliance issues.
Fishery Officers promote compliance with regulations by working with user groups (e.g. hunters and buyers) and other stakeholders to better understand the laws. Fishery Officers engage hunters and people involved in the marine mammal trade industry to provide information that increases awareness and helps address compliance and conservation concerns in the Atlantic walrus fishery. Increased education and awareness will help protect the legal market and trade of Atlantic walrus ivory and parts.
Current Compliance Issues
Specific concerns may arise from: failing to follow conditions of licence for the sport hunt, non-reporting or misreporting of harvest, wastage, illegal harvest or illegal trade and exporting of Atlantic walrus ivory and or parts. Patrols have been conducted in Atlantic walrus hunting areas and communities to monitor these concerns.
Compliance Strategy
Conservation and Protection collaborates with internal and external partners to identify and prioritize compliance issues and works with resource managers to address them.
Fishery Officers focus efforts on:
- compliance with legislation, including sport hunt licence conditions;
- tusk traceability / illegal trade of ivory tusks;
- licence inspections.
Operational Activities include:
- Monitoring of Atlantic walrus sport hunts;
- Education of user groups and stakeholders;
- Inspections of Atlantic walrus products from harvest to export;
- Cross reference of harvest data with trade data;
- Liaise with Nunavut Conservation Officers and other territorial or provincial law enforcement agencies.

10. Performance Review
This Atlantic walrus IFMP was developed through an extensive consultative process including the NWMB, NTI, RWOs, HTOs, walrus hunters and community members. DFO will continue to consult with these groups throughout the life of this IFMP as circumstances require.
Annual post season review sessions will be conducted with co-management organizations and as circumstances require. Progress on achieving the short term objectives and effective implementation of management measures identified in the Plan will be reviewed. Recommendations to improve management of the walrus fishery will be developed to meet the long term objectives of maintaining a sustainable walrus fishery.

- Unless a TAH is in place, an Inuk may, without a licence, fish for food, social or ceremonial purposes for four (4) walrus in a year except where community quotas exist (Coral Harbour (60), Sanikiluaq (10), Arctic Bay (10) and Clyde River (20)).(MMR, s. 6 and 26).
- Where a TAH has been established, annual harvest may not exceed the total allowable harvest level established for a particular management unit.
- Harvest information must be reported (MMR s. 17; Fisheries Act s. 61; and the NA s. 5.7.43).
- When the quota or total allowable harvest level is reached, the community will be notified and the fishery will be closed (MMR s. 12 and 26).
- The Minister may issue a marine mammal fishing licence (MMR s. 4).
- The Minister may issue a licence for certain activities such as for tagging (satellite tracking), live capture, biopsies (MMR s. 11).
- Where a TAH has been established, DFO will issue Post-Harvest Walrus Tags to the RWO and/or HTOs in the amount equal to the annual harvest level for the corresponding management unit. These tags will be issued without fee or administrative charge and are not to be considered a licence to hunt.
- Hunters shall only kill a walrus in a manner that is designed to kill it quickly(MMR s. 8).
- No person shall disturb a walrus except when hunting for walrus (MMR s. 7).
- Hunters must have all necessary equipment on hand to retrieve a hunted walrus (MMR s. 9).
- Hunters that kill or wound a walrus must make all reasonable efforts to retrieve it without delay, must not abandon or discard it, or waste any edible part of a walrus (MMR s. 10).
- Hunters are to use a rifle or shotgun with the following restrictions: a) a rifle and non-full metal jacketed ammunition that produce a muzzle energy of not less than 1,500 foot pounds; or b) a shotgun and rifled slugs that produce a muzzle energy of not less than 1,500 foot pounds (MMR s. 25).
- A Marine Mammal Transportation Licence is required to transport walrus or walrus parts from one province to another (MMR s. 16).
- A CITES Export Permit is required to transport walrus products outside of Canada.
- Fisheries Act s. 35: prohibits any person from carrying on any work, undertaking or activity that results in serious harm to walrus that are part of a commercial, recreational or Aboriginal fishery, unless authorized by the Minister.
Appendix 3. Walrus Sport Hunt Policy in the Nunavut Settlement Area
A. Where a Total Allowable Harvest has been established for a walrus stock or population
Where the Nunavut Wildlife Management Board (NWMB) and the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) establish a total allowable harvest (TAH) for a stock or population of walrus in the Nunavut Settlement Area (NSA), the assignment provisions of the Nunavut Agreement (NA) shall be used to assign part or all of the TAH to a walrus sport hunt.
In 2013, the Minister of DFO accepted the NWMB’s decision to establish the basic needs levels (BNL) for beluga, narwhal and walrus in the NSA to be equal to the levels of total allowable harvest (TAH) established or modified by the NWMB. As per the NA, Hunters and Trappers Organizations (HTO) and Regional Wildlife Organizations (RWOs) are responsible for allocating their community’s and regional TAH to their members and the assignment to non-members (e.g. walrus sport hunt) (s. 5.7.3 and 5.7.6).
An assignment under section 5.7.34 (b) of the NA is used to authorize walrus sport hunts to a person qualified to harvest walrus under the laws of general application, so long as the established annual total allowable harvest for that particular management unit is not exceeded.
Under sections 5 and 6 of the Marine Mammal Regulations, no person other than an Indian, Inuk, or beneficiary, may fish for walrus except under the authority of a licence.
If an HTO wishes to assign part or all of a share of their community’s allocation of the TAH for walrus sport hunting purposes, the following process will be undertaken to obtain a valid Marine Mammal Fishing Licence prior to engaging in walrus hunting activities:
The HTO will:
- Complete and submit the Sport Hunt Application package to DFO.
- Upon receiving the completed documents and payment of fee, the Minister of DFO may issue a Marine Mammal Fishing Licence for walrus pursuant to section 4(1) of the Marine Mammal Regulations.
- All conditions identified on the Marine Mammal Fishing Licence must be followed by the assignee (sport hunter). The Marine Mammal Regulations (MMR) include provisions related to the hunting, movement, and sale of walrus products. These provisions include requirements for hunters to report on harvesting activities, to collect biological samples, to hunt in a manner that is designed to kill the walrus quickly, to make reasonable efforts to retrieve a killed or wounded walrus without delay and to have all necessary equipment on hand to retrieve it. Abandoning, discarding or wasting edible parts of walrus is prohibited.
- Any HTO by-laws that are in place governing walrus hunting will also be followed by the assignee (sport hunter).
- A DFO Marine Mammal Transportation Licence is required to transport walrus or walrus parts from one province to another (MMR s. 16(1)). These are free and available from a DFO Fishery Officer or from the community’s local Conservation Officer.
- Anyone wishing to export walrus parts or derivatives from Canada must obtain an export permit from the Canadian CITES administration. These permits can take several weeks to obtain. For more information, contact the DFO CITES Permitting Officer at: (888) 641-6464.
B. Where a TAH has not been established for a walrus stock or population
Each year the Nunavut Wildlife Management Board (NWMB) requests applications (Request to Conduct Walrus Sport Hunts) from communities and individuals for walrus sport hunts. These applications are reviewed by the NWMB according to its Interim Policy for Walrus Sport Hunts. Decisions of the NWMB are forwarded to the Minister of Fisheries & Oceans Canada (DFO). If approved, and upon payment of fee, the Minister will provide the applicant with a Marine Mammal Fishing Licence under section 4(1) of the Marine Mammal Regulations. The process is detailed in the steps below:
Request to conduct walrus sport hunt:
Each fall, the NWMB seeks applications from individuals and communities who wish to conduct walrus sport hunts for the following walrus harvesting season (April 1-March 31). Applicants are required to submit a completed “Request to Conduct Walrus Sport Hunt” form that includes information on the hunt plan, outfitter information, a safety plan, and evidence of support from the local HTO.
NWMB review of applications:
The NWMB reviews the Requests to Conduct Walrus Sport Hunts against its Interim Policy for Walrus Sport Hunts. This Policy seeks to consider conservation concerns, health and safety, humane harvesting and minimization of waste, and long-term economic, social and cultural interests of Inuit harvesters, in making sport hunt decisions.
NWMB decision to DFO:
Decisions of the NWMB in relation to the walrus sport hunt are forwarded to the Minister of DFO as per the NA. Additional conditions may be included with the NWMB decision, such as the assignment of each walrus to a sport hunter is made in writing and that individuals applying for walrus sport hunts obtain written support from their local HTO.
DFO review:
The decisions of the NWMB are forwarded to the Minister of DFO for review. If approved, DFO will notify successful applicants. Upon receiving the completed “Assignment Document”, “Hunter Information Sheet”, and payment of fee, the Minister of DFO will issue a Marine Mammal Fishing Licence for walrus pursuant to section 4(1) of the Marine Mammal Regulations.
Marine Mammal Fishing Licence:
All conditions identified on a Marine Mammal Fishing Licence must be followed. Such conditions include: when and where the hunt is authorized to take place, by whom, their country of origin, quotas, gear type to be used, as well as any specific conditions related to the hunt, such as the reporting of all hunts to the local DFO office, firearm muzzle velocity requirements, the total number of strikes allowed, as well as biological sampling requirements.
Any HTO by-laws that are in place governing walrus hunting should be followed by the sport hunter.
A DFO Marine Mammal Transportation Licence is required to transport walrus or walrus parts from one province to another (MMR s. 16(1)). These are free and available from a DFO Fishery Officer or from a local Conservation Officer.
Anyone wishing to export walrus parts or derivatives from Canada must obtain an export permit from the Canadian CITES administration. These permits can take several weeks to obtain. For more information, contact the DFO CITES Permitting Officer at: (888) 641-6464.

Take this opportunity to learn about the Canadian territory, Nunavut.
Nunavut, which means ""our land"" in Inuktitut, the Inuit language, is Canada's largest territory, representing one-fifth of Canada's land mass. Nunavut was a part of the Northwest Territories until 1999, when it became a separate Canadian territory.
The province is located in Canada's artic circle and is made up of a mainland and many islands in the Arctic Ocean. Nunavut counts roughly 36,500 residents living in 25 communities ranging in population from 130 to over 6,500 in the Capital, Iqualuit. Native peoples of Inuit origin represent about 85 percent of the population, and form the foundation of the Territory's culture. About 50 percent of Nunavut's residents are under the age of 25. Located well into the Arctic, the average temperature in Nunavut in January is -30°C and in July is 10°C. Because of its latitude, the capital Iqaluit experiences 24 hours of daylight per day in June, and six hours per day in December.

Nunavut Economy and Employment
Nunavut's economy is centered around the area's natural resources. Much of the Inuit majority of the territory maintains strong ties to the land and their livelihoods are then based on their traditional harvesting methods. The harvesting economy is worth at least $40 million annually and provides many families with an affordable and important source of nutritious food.
Supplementing these traditions are new opportunities, which are rapidly transforming the economy and creating many new jobs in Nunavut. Mineral exploration, focusing on gold, diamond, and base metal deposits, is a growing industry in Nunavut. In 2011, the gold produced at the Meadowbank mine had a market value of roughly $420 million. Additionally, fishing, tourism, and Nunavut's oil and gas reserves provide important and growing contributions to the territory's economy.
Nunavut Standard of Living
Due to the challenges of vast distances, a small but growing population, the high cost of materials and labour, and extreme climate make it costly to maintain Canada's high standards of living in Nunavut. Residents must cope with a cost of living that can be significantly higher than many other places in Canada. The average household income in the Nunavut area is over $65,500 per year. However, the minimum wage stands at $11.00/hr, the highest in Canada.
In addition, the federal government takes a number of initiatives to compensate for the high cost of goods and services in Nunavut to ensure that its residents can enjoy the same standard of living that is available to all Canadians.
Nunavut Education
In Canada, all citizens and permanent residents under the age of 20 are entitled to a free education provided in the public education system through to the end of secondary school. Nunavut's department of education provides a comprehensive educational program that runs from early childhood education through Grade 12. Schooling is available in English, French and Inuktitut. The system also provides a number of programs aimed at developing skills geared towards finding employment and contributing to the economy.
Nunavut has one post secondary institution, Nunavut Arctic College, with campuses in Iqualuit and other areas. The college offers a number of professional and academic programs in Inuktitut and English.
Nunavut Health Care
Under Canadian Law, all provinces and territories must provide universal, publicly funded health care to all citizens and legal residents of Canada. In other words, most basic health services in Canada are offered at no direct cost to the patient. Certain procedures that are not deemed necessary (such as elective cosmetic surgery and a number of dental care procedures, for example) are generally not covered, but the list of services paid for publicly varies from province to province.
Nunavut has a fully comprehensive healthcare system, tailored to meet the unique challenges of low population density and difficult climate.
Nunavut History
The area which is now known as Nunavut has been home to a continuous population of Inuit peoples for over 4000 years. Despite contact with Europeans as early as the 1500's and becoming part of Canada's Northwest Territories in 1867, the people of Nunavut for the most part continued with their traditional lifestyles. Today the Inuit language and culture are alive and well in Nunavut.
Nunavut became a territory of Canada official on April 1st, 1999, making it Canadaâs newest territory. Prior to this point the area which is now Nunavut had been part of Canada's Northwest Territories. While Nunavut entered into Canadian confederation in 1999, the beginnings of its formation actually lie much earlier. As early as 1976, land claims by the Inuit people led to discussions with the federal government on the division of Northwest Territories.
In 1982, a vote was held in the Northwest Territories which strongly approved such a decision. After a long period of discussions on boundaries, the agreement was ratified by 85% of the voters in Nunavut in 1992. It was decided that Nunavut would become a territory in 1999, to allow time to build capable administration.
Nunavut Culture
The culture of Nunavut is strongly identified with the indigenous Inuit population. The Inuit people refers to a group of culturally similar indigenous peoples that inhabit the Arctic regions of North America. There are several Inuit languages, however the most common one is Inuktituk. Traditionally the Inuit way of life involved hunting and fishing, and confronting the challenges of survival in the Northern climate. While modernization has altered many of these traditions, the Inuit people take great effort to keep their culture alive.
Modern Nunavut is a mixture between the Inuit culture and modern Canadian culture. One can find there most of the same cultural interests one can find elsewhere in Canada, but also the unique Inuit culture. The Inuit culture is gaining increasing global attention because of its attitudes towards preserving nature and because their lifestyle is threatened by global warming.
Nunavut Demographics
With only approximately 36,500 residents inhabiting an area that occupies one fifth of Canada's total land mass, Nunavut has one of the lowest population densities in the world. Approximately 85% of the population is of Inuit descent. In addition the territory is host to other aboriginal First Nations and Metis communities.
Approximately nearly 7,000 people live in Nunavut's capital Iqaluit. The next largest community is Arviat, at just over 2,300. Most of the residents live in communities of under 1,500 people. This is in line with the maintenance of traditional Inuit communities in Nunavut.
Nunavut Immigration
At only 36,500 total residents, Nunavut does not receive a great deal of immigration on an annual basis. With the mining industry beginning to take off however, Nunavut is eager to attract skilled workers who can contribute to the growth of its economy. Many employers in Nunavut will pay an additional supplement to offset the higher cost of living in Nunavut.
Nunavut Government
As Nunavut is a territory of Canada rather than a province, the federal government maintains a greater control over its affairs than it would compared to provincial governments. For those affairs that are under its control, Nunavut has its own democratically elected parliament located in the capital of Iqaluit.
Politics in Nunavut take a slightly different form than elsewhere in Canada. Nunavut's legislature does not feature any political parties. Rather representatives are elected independently to represent a certain geographic area. The parliament then operates by consensus, selected a premier from amongst their members. The current Premier of Nunavut is Peter Taptuna. In addition, the Premier has a council of 11 Inuit elders to advise him on incorporating Inuit culture and knowledge into his policies.
Nunavut Major City
Iqaluit
The city of Iqaluit, formerly known as Frobisher Bay, is the capital of Nunavut as well as its largest city. At under 7,000 people, it has the lowest population of any capital city in Canada. Iqaluit was chosen to be the capital of Nunavut by a referendum amongst its residents, making it fairly unique among Canadian capital cities.
The first permanent settlement at Iqaluit was established in 1942 as an airbase and defense operation. While the Inuit had always referred to the area as Iqaluit, which means ""many fish"" (because of the abundant fishing stocks in the area), Canadian authorities named it Frobisher Bay after the body of water on which it is located. The name was officially changed in 1987.
As the capital city of Nunavut, government services are a major employer in the Iqaluit area. In addition the growth of mining and oil and gas operations in Nunavut means these industries are increasing their presence in Iqaluit. The city is growing at a rapid pace. .

intercontinentalcry,https://intercontinentalcry.org/nunavut-community-opposes-offshore-oil-gas-exploration/ https://intercontinentalcry.org/on-melting-ice/ https://intercontinentalcry.org/nunavut-community-opposes-offshore-oil-gas-exploration/ https://intercontinentalcry.org/nunavut-community-opposes-offshore-oil-gas-exploration/ ,"The Inuit community of Clyde River has restated its opposition to a proposal by the oil industry to conduct offshore seismic surveys near the community’s hunting grounds. The proposal is currently being assessed by the National Energy Board (NEB), and Nunavut communities are waiting for the board to finish analyzing submissions and make a decision on the file. Residents of several communities on Baffin Island have repeatedly opposed this proposal since it was first brought forward in 2011. Nunavut’s Inuit organizations have recommended the proposal not be approved until a Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) is conducted on the broader question of oil and gas development in the area. Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada has initiated an SEA, and preliminary meetings were held in Baffin communities in February 2014. However, the NEB has indicated that the SEA process will not alter its assessment of the proposed seismic survey. The consortium proposing the survey has begun advertising job openings for the proposed project in local media, with an expected start date of August 2014.
On February 25, 2014, the Hamlet Council and Hunters and Trappers Organization of Clyde River passed a joint motion, reaffirming their opposition to offshore oil and gas exploration and development, including seismic surveys. The motion stated that, as elected representatives of the community, both organizations have a “responsibility to protect the environment and safeguard our traditional way of life from rampant or unwanted development.” The motion goes on to state that at recent consultation meetings in the community “it was clearly, unequivocally and adamantly articulated…that our community is FIRMLY against any such oil and gas activity in our area and throughout Nunavut.” The resolution concludes that “both the Municipal Government and the Hunters and Trappers Organization of Clyde River speak in one voice, clearly opposing the proposed oil and gas seismic activity.”
This resolution follows a previous joint motion and letter by the Clyde River Hamlet and HTO in May of 2013, also opposing seismic surveys in the area. The joint letter made clear that the community was not against development or mineral extraction in general. “Like all Nunavut communities, we need and support economic and other opportunities that contribute towards enhanced levels of employment for our people”. However, it also made clear that the Inuit of Clyde River wish to balance economic development and wage labour opportunities with maintaining subsistence hunting. “Regardless of any economic development, we will need to protect and sustain our 4000 year plus old culture of subsistence harvesting in this region.” The letter argued that proposed oil and gas activity was not consistent with this balance. “The proposed seismic testing and the resulting oil and gas development it would bring are not balanced development. It is utterly against the global movement to decrease global warming and to decrease our dependence on fossil fuels”. It concluded by stating that the Hamlet and HTO are “firmly opposed to seismic testing in Baffin Bay and Davis Strait”.
The current proposal was submitted by a consortium of three companies – TGS-NOPEC Geophysical Company ASA, Petroleum GeoServices and Multi Klient Invest AS (“the consortium”). Officially titled the “2011 Northeastern Canada 2D Marine Seismic Survey”, the proposal is to conduct seismic surveys in Baffin Bay and Davis Strait. The project would take place seasonally over five years, and is intended to identify potential oil deposits below the ocean floor.
This work would involve a ship using air guns to blast loud bursts of sound under the water. Sensors would then detect and record the way sound bounces off the ocean floor, providing information about underwater geology. The data collected would then be sold by the consortium, to the oil industry, which would use it to locate potential oil and gas deposits to begin exploratory drilling.
The proposal overlaps with important habitat and migration routes for various species of marine mammal Inuit harvest for subsistence. The offshore fishing grounds for Nunavut’s commercial fishery also overlap with the proposed survey lines. This has led to serious concerns that the loud noise emitted during surveys may alter the migration routes or physically damage the hearing of marine mammals. It has likewise caused concern that the surveys may cause fish to disperse, causing reduced catches for the local commercial fishery.
The consortium submitted an environmental impact statement in April of 2011. Nexus Coastal Resource Management, a consulting firm established by professionals from Dalhousie University, was hired by the consortium to engage with communities. Following a long period of information requests, the NEB held hearings in four Baffin Island communities in April and May of 2013. Final comments and the consortium’s responses were submitted in early November of 2013. The NEB is in the process of assessing the submissions in order to reject or approve the proposal.
It is important to stress that this is NOT the proposal for seismic surveys in Lancaster Sound which Inuit communities, with the support of the Qikiqtani Inuit Association and environmental organizations, successfully opposed. The current seismic proposal would not cover Lancaster Sound.
The proposal for Lancaster Sound received significant attention from the national media. However, aside from local sources, there has been no media attention to the controversy surrounding the current proposal. Thus far, there has been no official involvement from environmental or other political organizations, aside from the work of the Qikiqtani Inuit Association, the organization which represents Inuit from the Baffin region under the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement.
Nunavut is a Canadian Territory encompassing the Eastern Arctic and most High Arctic Islands. Located almost entirely above the treeline, Nunavut is sparsely populated and none of its communities are connected to one another, or southern Canada, through road or rail. Inuit, the Indigenous people inhabiting the Canadian Arctic, constitute a demographic majority in the territory.
The Nunavut Territory was created as part of the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement (NLCA). Through this agreement, the Inuit of Nunavut exchanged their Aboriginal Title to the area for money, fee simple title and resource rights to some lands, and a series of constitutionally entrenched specific rights. The NLCA also created a series of new governance institutions. The new territory came with a new public Government of Nunavut (GN). New Inuit organizations were created to manage the land and capital Inuit received through the agreement, and to represent Inuit politically under the agreement. These include Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated – a territory-wide organization – and three regional organizations. The Qikiqtani Inuit Association is the regional organization for Baffin Island. A new regulatory regime for resource extraction – including an impact review board and planning commission – was also created.
Because the seismic survey proposal lies outside of the Nunavut Settlement Area, it lies outside of the jurisdiction of Nunavut’s planning commission and review board. This also means NTI and QIA do not possess resource or other property rights to the area the consortium is proposing to survey.
The joint motions from Clyde River follow years of opposition from residents of the region.
Residents of Clyde River submitted a series of petitions to the NEB opposing the proposal in June of 2011. (The petitions are available here, here, and here). In May of 2013, residents of Pond Inlet submitted another petition opposing seismic surveys.
In October of 2013, the Qiqiktani Inuit Association (QIA) wrote to the NEB, and requested that NEB not grant a permit until a strategic environmental assessment is conducted to consider the broader impacts of opening the Baffin region to oil and gas development. Shortly thereafter Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated unanimously passed a motion supporting QIA’s position. The motion requested that “no permits related to oil and gas development, which includes seismic testing, be issued in the Baffin Bay, Davis Strait, Hudson Bay, Hudson Strait, Foxe Basin, Lancaster Sound and Parry Channel until such time as a Strategic Environmental Assessment is completed and Inuit concerns are addressed to the satisfaction of Inuit.”
Firm opposition was also expressed by many community members at NEB hearings held in the spring of 2013 in Pond Inlet, Clyde River, Qikiqtarjuaq and Iqaluit.
In Pond Inlet, Niko Inuarak* told the NEB, “the people in Pond Inlet are against it. We were against it in the first place and we’ve been against it since 1970s. So we are going to write a petition for this so just so you guys know. And thank you for coming here. Hopefully we won’t see you guys again and you’ll stop coming here to do seismic test.”
At the hearing in Clyde River*, Joavie Etuangat said “The people of Clyde River have been going against any projects. It’s unfortunate that you keep coming back when we didn’t want anything, any project to proceed.”
Samuel Naqingaq*, chairperson of the Qikiqtarjuaq Hunters and Trappers Organization told the NEB, “On behalf of the hunters in the community, we still have a concern what you are proposing because…a lot of us think that it’s going to affect our animals, what we eat.”
Nigel Qaumariaq, an Inuk from Iqaluit, attended the hearings held in all four communities. At the final hearing, held in Iqaluit, he stated, “to think that there’s any support from any communities, that is very wrong. There has been moments where there’s this tug and pull between modern and traditional way but I have not seen any support for this project.”
“So therefore, I will say I will use my every last ounce of energy to make sure that this project doesn’t go ahead until the communities are comfortable.”
For many Inuit at the hearings, the issue is much bigger than this specific proposal. A major source of concern and opposition is the potential impacts of the oil development the seismic survey will facilitate.
Ezekiel Muktar* from Pond Inlet told the NEB, “Drilling in ocean, I don’t want that to take place at all and I want to be heard about that.”
“This area is only for hunting. It is only — it is our only hunting ground and we are very protective of this area and it would be great if you could move off to your other projects. This area, the ocean is our only hunting area and the land, the animals will be affected. So, somehow, your projects, papers, letters, take them and go home and don’t come me back into this area. It’s no good — this project is no good for me.”
Concerns with the inability to clean up potential oil spills in the Arctic Ocean were prominent. At the hearing in Pond Inlet, Cornelius Kadloo Nutanik* said, “Right now, I don’t want to give approval because of this reason. There are no equipment to clean things up that — when there’s a ship that can clean up a mess, a big mess, then we can start giving approval. That there’s nothing — no equipment like that right now and nothing to clean up oils if — and in Pond Inlet, there’s no — nothing to clean up — clean things up.”
These broader concerns with opening the Baffin region to oil development are not considered in the NEB assessment, due to its narrow assessment of cumulative impacts. The scope of the review states that consideration of the cumulative effects of other activities “will be limited to those for which formal plans or applications have been made.”
In Pond Inlet, some concerns were related to narwhal becoming stranded in sea ice in 2008 after seismic surveys were conducted. Roughly 500 narwhals were stranded in a fiord as sea ice formed, and over 400 had to be culled by local hunters.
Joshua Arreak*, a resident of Pond Inlet, told the NEB, “in 2008 we had narwhal frozen in, and apparently there have been seismic activity in Baffin Bay at that time. We understand that narwhal flee activity. Well, marine wildlife flee, especially narwhal, flee activity. And we understood that they were frozen and due to seismic activity.”
Biologists have also identified seismic surveys as a potential cause of the entrapment, and have called for further studies on the effects of seismic surveys on narwhal before further surveys are carried out.
Baffin Island is home to an expanding commercial fishing industry. The four major territorial organizations are the Arctic Fishery Alliance (AFA), the Baffin Fishery Coalition (BFC), Cumberland Sound Fisheries Ltd., and the Qikiqtaaluk Corporation. Collectively, these organizations hold Nunavut’s shrimp and turbot quota. The commercial fishery is an important source of employment for Inuit throughout Baffin Island.
BFC outlined the fishing industry’s concerns with seismic surveys in a presentation at the 2012 Nunavut Petroleum Workshop. The presentation indicated that the key concerns are the potential for fish to disperse while seismic surveys are conducted, and a related reduction in harvest for commercial fishers. The BFC also called for increased communication between the fishing industry and the seismic consortium, and a clear compensation package in the event of reductions in harvest. These concerns were voiced by the BFC, the AFA, and the Government of Nunavut in submissions to the National Energy Board’s review of the seismic proposal.
Concerns with a lack of a firm compensation package were also a concern at the public hearings. Some felt that there was no clear avenue for Inuit to be compensated if the proposed survey affects the marine mammals and fish that the communities rely on for subsistence harvesting.
Nigel Qaumariaq told the NEB in Iqaluit, “The company has been dodging it and avoiding compensation issues that Inuit have been bringing up. They’ll say, “The company will respond. Come talk to us”. That’s not acceptable. That is not acceptable because the company will say, “Prove it”. Then you have to go to science to prove it. No other mechanism, no other mechanism to determine what the effects will be.”
The question of local benefits was a common theme at the public hearings. Nigel Qaumariaq told the NEB, “That’s the biggest concern right now is: How can Inuit benefit? Because, right now, Inuit will not get anything outside of the NSA, according to our Land Claim. It’s just not there.”
Because the proposed survey lies outside of the Nunavut Settlement Area, there does not seem to be any mechanism to ensure local communities substantially benefit from the proposal. Royalties and taxes will inevitably flow out of the region, and there is no requirement for the consortium to negotiate an impact and benefit agreement with communities.
The consortium will have to submit a benefit plan to Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada, which may include commitments to local hiring and contracting. The consortium has committed to training and hiring marine mammal observers and community liaison workers from nearby communities. The consortium also claims it has discussed “other possible benefits with the Hamlet councils and we will continue to do so.” These discussions do not appear to be available on the public record. However, the fact that Clyde River’s Hamlet council has reaffirmed its opposition to the proposal implies that the Hamlet is not satisfied with the consortium’s plans for local benefits.
The training and employment to which they’ve committed themselves only amounts to a few temporary and seasonal jobs. Given the potential for negative impacts and lack of substantial community benefits, it is difficult to see this proposal as “development”. Simple robbery seems to be a much more apt description of what the consortium is proposing, from the perspective at least some Northerners. As the Hamlet of Pangnirtung explained during a meeting in 2012, “We have everything to lose and nothing to gain – we would be crazy to support it.”
The high degree of opposition to the proposal is likely due in part to the fact that the consortium seems unable to properly engage with Inuit communities. Some of the public information meetings the consortium held were so poorly planned that no one from the public attended.
The consortium neglected to bring environmental specialists to the public hearings, making them unable to respond to even the most basic of questions from the public about the potential impacts of the project. This was highlighted clearly in an exchange between Iqaluit resident Nigel Qaumariaq and Garry Morrow, a representative of the consortium.
Mr. Qaumariaq asked “I want to know from the company if it will affect walrus migration routes. And what information they have — do not refer me to the environmental impact statement, please tell me. And I don’t want to hear it afterwards.” Mr. Morrow responded, “Yes. We don’t have the answer for you.”
Mr. Qaumariaq went on to ask what affects the project might have on various species of seal. Mr. Morrow responded, “We don’t have an answer for you on that.”
Mr. Qaumariaq then asked what affects the project might have on Polar Bears. Mr. Morrow responded, “As you probably know, we’re here for the operations and so I know you didn’t want to hear but the environmental assessment’s been filed. So we’re more the operations guys, you know. I’m an operations person; so…”
It is, therefore, not surprising that the October 2013 submission from the QIA stated, in no uncertain terms, “The consultation strategy adopted by the proponents to date has not been effective to properly address the communities’ questions and concerns.”
Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada has responded to the QIA’s call for a strategic environmental assessment to be held on the question of offshore oil development near Baffin Island. Preliminary meetings were held in Baffin communities in February of 2014. At this point, there is no on-line public registry or other source of publicly available information on the strategic environmental assessment’s scope or process. Given the significance of the issues the process is intended to address – the wisdom of opening Baffin Bay and Davis Strait to oil and gas development – some would likely argue that the assessment should be transparent.
Meanwhile, the NEB assessment of the proposed seismic survey continues. In an e-mail dated February 26, 2014, a representative of the NEB indicated that it is in the process of reviewing submissions and will make its decision once this review is complete. The e-mail also indicated that the assessment will continue, despite AANDC’s strategic environmental assessment.
“The NEB is required to assess applications that are before the Board on a case-by-case basis. The Board’s determination of the Project’s potential for significant environmental impacts under the Canada Oil and Gas Operations Act (COGOA) is independent of possible or pending strategic or regional assessments and planning or management processes, although such information would be considered if it were available and appropriate.”
The consortium has begun advertising job openings for the proposed project in local media. According to the advertisement, “Work is planned to commence in August 2014”.
Concern and opposition regarding offshore seismic surveys is a global issue and by no means limited to Nunavut.
Biologists have raised concerns about the impact of surveys on fish and marine mammals in Nova Scotia. Media sources and marine biologists have speculated that offshore seismic surveys are responsible for stranding and killing whales in New Zealand, Iceland, and Ghana. Research from Norway suggests that seismic surveys cause fish to disperse, resulting in massive declines in cod catch for local fisheries.
In South Africa, concerns that offshore seismic surveys may lead to disruptions in sea mammal migration routes, preventing them from reaching breeding and feeding grounds and potentially causing strandings and deaths, led to the government suspending a proposed survey.
In Trinidad and Tobago, fishers received over $75 million in compensation payments between 2010 and 2013. Despite the payment of compensation, many fishers from the island nation remain resolutely opposed to the surveys and are becoming increasingly confrontational in their opposition. In September of 2013, a group called Fishermen and Friends of the Sea wrote to the government, requesting that seismic surveys be halted until a proper environmental impact study is conducted. Protests were held in October and November of 2013. In January 2014, local fishers engaged in direction action, leading a flotilla of fishing vessels to obstruct seismic surveys.
In the United States, marine conservation group Oceana submitted a petition in September of 2013, calling on the government to stop the proposed use of seismic surveys off the Atlantic Coast. In February of 2014, over 100 scientists signed a letter submitted to President Obama by Oceana, urging him to halt the Atlantic seismic proposal until new acoustic guidelines for marine mammals are developed.
Indigenous Peoples are putting their bodies on the line and it's our responsibility to make sure you know why. That takes time, expertise and resources - and we're up against a constant tide of misinformation and distorted coverage. By supporting IC you're empowering the kind of journalism we need, at the moment we need it most. . The Inuit in the Canadian Arctic are engaged in a centuries-old fight to retain their culture and reestablish self-determination and genuine sovereignty. In particular, Inuit in the autonomous territory of Nunavut are resisting what American Indian studies scholar Daniel R. Wildcat has described as a “fourth removal attempt” of Indigenous people, coming on the heels of failed efforts at spatial, social and psycho-cultural deletion.
The common discourse on climate change focuses on the physical world: inexorably rising atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and the impact on sea-ice extent; melting glaciers; and roiling, unpredictable perturbations in weather patterns. But these are but the physical manifestations of political decisions made in the social world. The questions behind them include: Who produced all that extra CO2? For what purposes? And which sets of people are paying the most immediate price?
In both realms, the Arctic, one of the regions least responsible for causing climate change, is bearing the most immediate brunt; though as Inuit activist, Nobel Prize nominee and author Sheila Watt-Cloutier warns in her book, The Right to Be Cold, “whatever happens in the poles will eventually happen everywhere else.”
To frame climate change in the Arctic as simply a story of liquefying dihydrogen monoxide is deceptive. The ice-filled north is first and foremost a human story, a story about home and the struggle to preserve it against outside forces. It is about a culture that quite literally rests on knowledge of ice, ocean and the animals that live on top and underneath it.
James Qillaq, mayor of Clyde River in Nunavut, explained, “That connection to the land, that’s our life … that’s the reason why we stand: our connection to the land and water, of something that is ours, that’s it. That’s it and nothing else. That’s our everything — our connection to the land.”
Jerry Natanine, also of Clyde River, added, “Different animals are hunted in different seasons. We follow the young seals when they go out, to go hunt them, fishing season when the fish are plentiful. There’s a time when the Arctic char smell like what they eat in the ocean — that’s when some people don’t like to eat them. When that’s over, berry-picking season.”
With over 80 different terms to describe various aspects and characteristics of sea ice, the life of Inuit in Clyde River is intimately connected to the reliable variability and cycles of sea ice. In her book, The Meaning of Ice, scientist and longtime resident of Clyde River Shari Fox Gearheard notes: “The cycle of sea ice is bonded to cycles of hunting, of family activities, of equipment preparation, and even of cravings for different foods.”
But as Jerry Natanine notes, things have changed. “Maybe one of the biggest changes would be old ice,” he told me. “There used to be old ice that was really thick, and that would be out in the coast, and it would protect our inlets from waves…. But now ice comes out faster and the waves come in sooner … springtime seal hunting hasn’t been as good as it used to be. In James’s day, like my parents’ day, they hardly ever worried about [thin ice]. There might be an open water here or there, but now we worry about it even more.”
Climate Change and Arctic Amplification
The most recent displacement attempt against Inuit is related to the fact that the Arctic is warming at twice the rate of lower latitudes. Over the last five decades, sea ice has vanished from an area twice the size of Alaska. The remaining ice is 50 percent thinner. The last nine years have all had the lowest sea-ice extents measured, with February 2015 showing the lowest in 37 years of satellite data. Over 50 percent of the gigantic ice sheet that blankets Greenland was melting during the summer of 2015, contributing to the 36th consecutive year of global glacier loss.
Going further back in time, recent research based on a compendium of historical data shows, “there is no point in the past 150 years where sea ice extent is as small as it has been in recent years,” whereby the rate of retreat is “unprecedented in the historical record.” Commenting on the study, climate scientist and director of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies, Gavin Schmidt confirmed: “From this work it’s clear that recent changes are enormously outside the bounds of natural variability over the historical period.”
To observe some of these changes — and in response to an invitation to supply the Inuit community of Clyde River with solar panels for their community hall — in August, the Greenpeace vessel Arctic Sunrise sailed from St. Johns, Newfoundland, with a hold full of solar panels. Along with activists and Greenpeace campaigners, on board the ship were the current mayor of Clyde River, James Qillaq and former mayor Jerry Natanine and his daughter Clara. All of them have been actively campaigning against the Canadian government’s approval of seismic blasting in Baffin Bay, where they hunt. As we sail further north, deeper into the Canadian Arctic on the voyage to Clyde River, Schmidt’s chilling prediction, “under continued emissions we are likely to see summer ice … effectively disappear over the next few decades,” is borne out by our observations from the deck of the Sunrise: The scantiness of thinning patches of sea-ice tells its own story. As if to emphasize the paucity of sea ice, giant tabular bergs, some several stories high, float by us on their journey from Greenland toward the Canadian Coast. A startlingly beautiful combination of blinding white and translucent electric blue against the dark backdrop of sea and sky, the bergs are bobbing, melting reminders of ever-decreasing land-based glaciers.
Record heat in the first half of 2016 edged the world to within touching distance of the 1.5C maximal limit declared dangerous by world leaders in Paris just six months earlier, when 192 countries agreed that the limit should not be breached. With land and sea temperatures averaging 1.3C higher than the 20th century average, the UN observed in July, “Arctic sea ice melted early and fast … June 2016 marked the 14th consecutive month of record heat for land and oceans. It marked the 378th consecutive month with temperatures above the 20th century average. The last month with temperatures below the 20th century average was December 1984.” [emphasis added].
Climate Change, Capitalism and Inuit Livelihoods
For Inuit, Arctic climatic change imposed by a social system based on profit and endless commodification represents a double threat to their culture. In a 2006 survey of attitudes toward further commodification and paid employment versus traditional hunting and gathering practices, 75 percent of Inuit in Nunavut wanted to retain a mix of subsistence and wage work, only 15 percent responding said they wanted to work solely for money. This is an unsurprising statistic when 80 percent of people obtain the majority of their meat and fish from subsistence hunting and 96 percent share food with other households, according to John Talberth and Daphne Wysham’s report “Beyond Fossil Fuels.” Whenever there is a successful hunt, news spreads instantly via radio. All households, including those in other communities, have the opportunity to share in the skill and good fortune of the hunting party.
Illustrative of conflicting value systems, even though affordable quality housing is in desperate short supply, in 2016 the people of Nunavut voted overwhelmingly to prevent the sale and privatization of municipal property, allowing them to retain collective control over their own land. Housing is not the only thing in short supply. The following quote is from a report prepared for the Nunavut Roundtable for Poverty Reduction, “Understanding Poverty in Nunavut”:
The Income Support Program in Nunavut exists to help those unable to access a minimum standard of living. In Nunavut, half of the population needs this help for at least a portion of the year, and almost 60 percent of the population lives in public housing. Nearly 70 percent of Nunavut’s children live in households rated as food insecure and 15 percent of children will experience at least one day in the year when they do not eat. In Nunavut, poverty is not a fringe or special interest issue. It is the issue.
According to the Greenpeace-commissioned report on eastern Nunavut, “Beyond Fossil Fuels” and confirmed elsewhere, the median wage for Inuit is $19,900 (Canadian), while for non-Inuit living in Nunavut it is a staggeringly disparate $86,600. As the authors of the Greenpeace-commissioned report comment, “The irony is that poverty is, in many ways, a product of the formal market economy. In the indigenous economy, financial insecurity, food insecurity and substandard housing did not exist.”
As history bears out, is it any wonder that Nunavummiut are skeptical of the much-touted benefits of the market? The decline of Inuit living standards with the advance of colonialism and the increasing intrusion of market economics into Inuit life is attested to in the journal entries of Sir William Edward Parry, the British naval officer, arctic explorer and hydrographer who visited Clyde River almost 200 years ago. In September 1820, Parry wrote:
To judge by their appearance, and what is perhaps a better criterion, the number of their children, there can be little doubt that the means of subsistence which they possess are very abundant; but of this we had more direct proof, by the quantity of sea-horses and seals which we found concealed under stones, along the shore of the north branch…. Upon the whole, these people may be considered to be in possession of every necessary of life, as well as of most of the comforts and conveniences which can be enjoyed here.
Today, extreme corporate profiteering exacerbates the poverty and inequality in Clyde River. The cost of basic necessities is grossly higher than in southern Canada. Like many communities in the north, the only store in town is operated by the Northern multinational grocery and retail corporation, part of the North West company headquartered in Winnipeg, Manitoba. In a direct link to Canada’s colonial history, North West traces its origins back to colonial fur trading. It was formerly the Hudson’s Bay Company, which started its fur business in British-controlled North America in the latter half of the 1700s.
Prices in Northern’s store in Clyde River are shocking: a single can of Coke is $6.15; 12 rolls of toilet paper are $12.99; a pack of 38 diapers is $30.99. According to people living in Clyde, the prices we saw in the supermarket will rise higher as September approaches, in anticipation of the arrival of the once-yearly supply ship.
Such disparity in price for everyday items is symptomatic of the racism, exploitation and neglect condoned and perpetuated by the Canadian state. As Native-American scholar and professor of law, Robert A. Williams Jr. wrote in Savage Anxieties, “Canada is one of the world’s most prosperous countries, yet its record in protecting the most basic human rights of Indigenous tribal peoples has been abysmal. … Major organs of the United Nations have recognized the critical relationship between First Nations’ poverty in Canada and the state’s failure to protect traditional lands, territories, and resources from environmentally destructive development.”
Indigenous Activism and UNDRIP
But such failure is far from unique. It has taken decades of relentless campaigning by Indigenous groups to force the international community to recognize rights to their historical lands. Finally, seven years into the 21st century, the United Nations put forward the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People (UNDRIP) for the world’s governments to adopt and sign. At the signing ceremony in September 2007 however, Canada was one of only four countries in the entire General Assembly to vote against adoption of UNDRIP. The other countries: the United States, New Zealand and Australia. To maintain legitimacy, these four colonial settler states must deny not only their despotic, racist and genocidal origins, but also the continuance of neocolonial policies that refuse to accept the primacy of Indigenous land sovereignty. Neocolonial policies directed against Indigenous land sovereignty continue today, as shown by an Inuit case being brought before the Supreme Court of Canada on November 30 against seismic blasting in Baffin Bay in search of oil and gas deposits, legal support for which is being provided by Greenpeace. The continuation of these policies is also evident in the struggle against the Dakota Access pipeline by Native Americans from the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation, North Dakota and more than 100 other tribes from across North America. Historian and Native-American scholar Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz writes in An Indigenous People’s History of the United States:
The form of colonialism that Indigenous peoples of North America have experienced was modern from the beginning: the expansion of European corporations, backed by government armies, into foreign areas, with the subsequent expropriation of lands and resources. Settler colonialism is a genocidal policy. … The early twenty-first century has seen increased exploitation of energy resources begetting new pressures on indigenous lands. … Strengthening Indigenous sovereignty and self-determination to prevent [renewed expropriation of land and resources] will take general public outrage and demand, which in turn will require that the general population, those descended from settlers and immigrants, know their history and assume responsibility.
Specifically, Article 32 of UNDRIP notes, “States shall consult and cooperate in good faith with the Indigenous peoples concerned through their own representative institutions in order to obtain their free and informed consent prior to the approval of any project affecting their lands or territories and other resources, particularly in connection with the development.”
The key phrase in Article 32, “prior and informed consent,” changes everything about Clyde River’s legal standing in their impending case before the Canadian Supreme Court. If acted upon, consultation with Inuit and all other Indigenous groups has to be genuine on any issue that pertains to their “land and territories,” and projects cannot move forward without their “informed consent.” The question is whether Canada will be legally or morally bound to uphold UNDRIP, a declaration it unapologetically refused to adopt in 2007, but which Prime Minister Trudeau has since signed on to this year.
For its part, the United States changed its position with respect to UNDRIP in 2010, when President Obama said the US would “lend its support” to the declaration. However, in a subsequent statement, the federal government made it clear that UNDRIP should not be taken as “legally binding or a statement of current international law.”
A Melting Arctic Brings New Threats and Reignites Resistance
In new challenges to Indigenous rights, the melting Arctic is fostering and aggravating geopolitical concerns. Under pressure from the rise of Indigenous protest movements across North America, President Obama and Prime Minister Trudeau issued a joint statement in March 2016, in which they ratcheted up the rhetoric of consultation with Indigenous peoples over development decisions. Framed as a major statement on action to protect the Arctic from climate change while developing energy and US-Canadian leadership, the two world leaders stated, “Canada and the US will continue to respect and promote the rights of Indigenous peoples in all climate change decision making.”
In a section on building a “sustainable Arctic economy” that is impossible to reconcile with the actions of their respective governments, Trudeau and Obama write, “We confirm that for commercial activities in the Arctic — including shipping, fishing, and oil and gas exploration and development — we will set a world-class standard by basing development decisions and operations on scientific evidence. Further, commercial activities will occur only when the highest safety and environmental standards are met, including national and global climate and environmental goals, and Indigenous rights and agreements.”
Yet, in the same month, a letter signed by 75 marine scientists was presented to President Obama, expressing concern about the US Interior Department’s proposal and approval for more seismic testing in the Atlantic. This concern is of direct relevance to Inuit who are fighting proposed seismic blasting in Baffin Bay. The scientist noted, “Airgun surveys [seismic blasting] have an enormous environmental footprint. For blue and other endangered great whales, for example, such surveys have been shown to disrupt activities essential to foraging and reproduction over vast ocean areas.” No stranger to the gap between words and deeds, President Obama came under fire again in August for authorizing more oil and gas leases in the Gulf of Mexico and the need for more seismic blasting.
President Obama’s approval for the leases came despite an open letter addressed to him in June, signed by a different group of 400 international Arctic, marine and climate scientists. The letter argued that the president should say no to new leasing or exploration in the Arctic and engage in better and fuller consultation with Arctic communities:
We, the undersigned, ask you to remove the two Arctic planning areas, which together comprise nearly the entire U.S. Chukchi and Beaufort seas, from the 2017–2022 Outer Continental Shelf Leasing Program. We further ask that you consult with indigenous communities and tribes, who have extensive traditional knowledge relevant to decision- making, and with Arctic scientists to identify and permanently withdraw additional important marine areas to promote a sustainable, resilient future for this extraordinary ecosystem.
US-Canadian Plans for Arctic Imperialism
One only needs to read the financial press to obtain statistics undermining any claim by the Obama administration to have environmental credentials or to take climate change seriously. As reported this year in Forbes, “The irony is that President Obama — who is not viewed as a friend of the oil and gas industry — has presided over rising oil production in each of the seven years he has been in office. … From that low point in 2008, U.S. oil production has grown each year to reach 9.4 million bpd in 2015 — a gain of 88 percent during Obama’s presidency. This is in fact the largest domestic oil production increase during any presidency in U.S. history.”
Presaging the melting of summer sea ice, writing in Foreign Affairs in 2013, Scott Borgerson excitedly noted in “The Coming Arctic Boom” that global warming is a reality that doesn’t have to be “all bad”:
In the Arctic, it is turning … an impassible body of water ringed by remote wilderness into … an epicenter of industry and trade akin to the Mediterranean Sea. The region’s melting ice and thawing frontier are yielding access to troves of natural resources, undiscovered oil and gas and massive deposits of valuable minerals … a central passageway for global maritime transportation.
Colonialism may have altered its methods in response to the resistance of colonized peoples across the world, but the aims remain the same. Rather than driving Inuit off the land, the US and Canada in the 21st century want to ensure Indigenous people continue to live in the Arctic, but do so without genuine sovereignty and decision-making power over how energy is produced. In this regard, one phrase in the Obama-Trudeau statement is telling. They write, “All Indigenous Peoples in the Arctic are vital to strengthening and supporting U.S. and Canadian sovereignty claims.” Which is to say, Indigenous people living in the Arctic and recognized as “American” or “Canadian” are central to cementing North American control over the region and dispelling the US and Canadian government’s geopolitical and military concerns with any Russian and Norwegian claims to offshore resources and mining rights. As noted in a July report to Congress by the US Department of Defense alluding to such concerns, as well as the increased risk of catastrophic environmental disasters and the immediate problem of climate change:
North American Aerospace Defense Command / U.S. Northern Command (NORAD/USNORTHCOM) and USEUCOM are concerned with security risks arising from increased shipping, military operations, and resource exploration in the Arctic as the ice-cap melts. … USNORTHCOM identifies increased resource exploration in the Arctic as driving an increase in the future demand for SAR (Search and Rescue) and environmental disaster response missions in support of other agencies and civil authorities.
The fears of the US military reinforce the fact that successfully resisting additional depredations of climate change in the Arctic and elsewhere means connecting this resistance to the overthrow of neocolonial policies promulgated by the United States and Canada. Former mayor of Clyde River Jerry Natanine, a staunch campaigner for Inuit rights and a fellow traveler on the Arctic Sunrise, sees it in precisely those terms:
As Inuit we feel we have the right to our territories. Even though our Land Claims Agreement with Canada states that our agreement only goes out twelve miles offshore but our animals we hunt, they cannot tell where that twelve mile is. …We feel that these waters are our waters, as a nation, as human beings that are living on the earth and we’ve lived in this area for thousands and thousands of years … Let’s say we want to drill for oil — that should be our choice, not anyone else’s. People shouldn’t come barging in and try to take over our land for mining or oiling and just extract the resources to take away. As Inuit we don’t want to be neglected when these decisions are being made because it’s our land that they’re dealing with, it’s not anybody else’s land because Inuit live here.
For those of us further south, effective resistance to climate change requires blanket opposition to US and Canadian imperial designs and neocolonial, racist policies. It means supporting the geographical rearrangement of North America to repatriate land and resources to the original inhabitants from whom it was stolen, taking genuine responsibility for history and fighting against ongoing crimes that serve and expand colonial profit and power.
Indigenous Peoples are putting their bodies on the line and it's our responsibility to make sure you know why. That takes time, expertise and resources - and we're up against a constant tide of misinformation and distorted coverage. By supporting IC you're empowering the kind of journalism we need, at the moment we need it most. . The Inuit community of Clyde River has restated its opposition to a proposal by the oil industry to conduct offshore seismic surveys near the community’s hunting grounds. The proposal is currently being assessed by the National Energy Board (NEB), and Nunavut communities are waiting for the board to finish analyzing submissions and make a decision on the file. Residents of several communities on Baffin Island have repeatedly opposed this proposal since it was first brought forward in 2011. Nunavut’s Inuit organizations have recommended the proposal not be approved until a Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) is conducted on the broader question of oil and gas development in the area. Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada has initiated an SEA, and preliminary meetings were held in Baffin communities in February 2014. However, the NEB has indicated that the SEA process will not alter its assessment of the proposed seismic survey. The consortium proposing the survey has begun advertising job openings for the proposed project in local media, with an expected start date of August 2014.
On February 25, 2014, the Hamlet Council and Hunters and Trappers Organization of Clyde River passed a joint motion, reaffirming their opposition to offshore oil and gas exploration and development, including seismic surveys. The motion stated that, as elected representatives of the community, both organizations have a “responsibility to protect the environment and safeguard our traditional way of life from rampant or unwanted development.” The motion goes on to state that at recent consultation meetings in the community “it was clearly, unequivocally and adamantly articulated…that our community is FIRMLY against any such oil and gas activity in our area and throughout Nunavut.” The resolution concludes that “both the Municipal Government and the Hunters and Trappers Organization of Clyde River speak in one voice, clearly opposing the proposed oil and gas seismic activity.”
This resolution follows a previous joint motion and letter by the Clyde River Hamlet and HTO in May of 2013, also opposing seismic surveys in the area. The joint letter made clear that the community was not against development or mineral extraction in general. “Like all Nunavut communities, we need and support economic and other opportunities that contribute towards enhanced levels of employment for our people”. However, it also made clear that the Inuit of Clyde River wish to balance economic development and wage labour opportunities with maintaining subsistence hunting. “Regardless of any economic development, we will need to protect and sustain our 4000 year plus old culture of subsistence harvesting in this region.” The letter argued that proposed oil and gas activity was not consistent with this balance. “The proposed seismic testing and the resulting oil and gas development it would bring are not balanced development. It is utterly against the global movement to decrease global warming and to decrease our dependence on fossil fuels”. It concluded by stating that the Hamlet and HTO are “firmly opposed to seismic testing in Baffin Bay and Davis Strait”.
The current proposal was submitted by a consortium of three companies – TGS-NOPEC Geophysical Company ASA, Petroleum GeoServices and Multi Klient Invest AS (“the consortium”). Officially titled the “2011 Northeastern Canada 2D Marine Seismic Survey”, the proposal is to conduct seismic surveys in Baffin Bay and Davis Strait. The project would take place seasonally over five years, and is intended to identify potential oil deposits below the ocean floor.
This work would involve a ship using air guns to blast loud bursts of sound under the water. Sensors would then detect and record the way sound bounces off the ocean floor, providing information about underwater geology. The data collected would then be sold by the consortium, to the oil industry, which would use it to locate potential oil and gas deposits to begin exploratory drilling.
The proposal overlaps with important habitat and migration routes for various species of marine mammal Inuit harvest for subsistence. The offshore fishing grounds for Nunavut’s commercial fishery also overlap with the proposed survey lines. This has led to serious concerns that the loud noise emitted during surveys may alter the migration routes or physically damage the hearing of marine mammals. It has likewise caused concern that the surveys may cause fish to disperse, causing reduced catches for the local commercial fishery.
The consortium submitted an environmental impact statement in April of 2011. Nexus Coastal Resource Management, a consulting firm established by professionals from Dalhousie University, was hired by the consortium to engage with communities. Following a long period of information requests, the NEB held hearings in four Baffin Island communities in April and May of 2013. Final comments and the consortium’s responses were submitted in early November of 2013. The NEB is in the process of assessing the submissions in order to reject or approve the proposal.
It is important to stress that this is NOT the proposal for seismic surveys in Lancaster Sound which Inuit communities, with the support of the Qikiqtani Inuit Association and environmental organizations, successfully opposed. The current seismic proposal would not cover Lancaster Sound.
The proposal for Lancaster Sound received significant attention from the national media. However, aside from local sources, there has been no media attention to the controversy surrounding the current proposal. Thus far, there has been no official involvement from environmental or other political organizations, aside from the work of the Qikiqtani Inuit Association, the organization which represents Inuit from the Baffin region under the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement.
Nunavut is a Canadian Territory encompassing the Eastern Arctic and most High Arctic Islands. Located almost entirely above the treeline, Nunavut is sparsely populated and none of its communities are connected to one another, or southern Canada, through road or rail. Inuit, the Indigenous people inhabiting the Canadian Arctic, constitute a demographic majority in the territory.
The Nunavut Territory was created as part of the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement (NLCA). Through this agreement, the Inuit of Nunavut exchanged their Aboriginal Title to the area for money, fee simple title and resource rights to some lands, and a series of constitutionally entrenched specific rights. The NLCA also created a series of new governance institutions. The new territory came with a new public Government of Nunavut (GN). New Inuit organizations were created to manage the land and capital Inuit received through the agreement, and to represent Inuit politically under the agreement. These include Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated – a territory-wide organization – and three regional organizations. The Qikiqtani Inuit Association is the regional organization for Baffin Island. A new regulatory regime for resource extraction – including an impact review board and planning commission – was also created.
Because the seismic survey proposal lies outside of the Nunavut Settlement Area, it lies outside of the jurisdiction of Nunavut’s planning commission and review board. This also means NTI and QIA do not possess resource or other property rights to the area the consortium is proposing to survey.
The joint motions from Clyde River follow years of opposition from residents of the region.
Residents of Clyde River submitted a series of petitions to the NEB opposing the proposal in June of 2011. (The petitions are available here, here, and here). In May of 2013, residents of Pond Inlet submitted another petition opposing seismic surveys.
In October of 2013, the Qiqiktani Inuit Association (QIA) wrote to the NEB, and requested that NEB not grant a permit until a strategic environmental assessment is conducted to consider the broader impacts of opening the Baffin region to oil and gas development. Shortly thereafter Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated unanimously passed a motion supporting QIA’s position. The motion requested that “no permits related to oil and gas development, which includes seismic testing, be issued in the Baffin Bay, Davis Strait, Hudson Bay, Hudson Strait, Foxe Basin, Lancaster Sound and Parry Channel until such time as a Strategic Environmental Assessment is completed and Inuit concerns are addressed to the satisfaction of Inuit.”
Firm opposition was also expressed by many community members at NEB hearings held in the spring of 2013 in Pond Inlet, Clyde River, Qikiqtarjuaq and Iqaluit.
In Pond Inlet, Niko Inuarak* told the NEB, “the people in Pond Inlet are against it. We were against it in the first place and we’ve been against it since 1970s. So we are going to write a petition for this so just so you guys know. And thank you for coming here. Hopefully we won’t see you guys again and you’ll stop coming here to do seismic test.”
At the hearing in Clyde River*, Joavie Etuangat said “The people of Clyde River have been going against any projects. It’s unfortunate that you keep coming back when we didn’t want anything, any project to proceed.”
Samuel Naqingaq*, chairperson of the Qikiqtarjuaq Hunters and Trappers Organization told the NEB, “On behalf of the hunters in the community, we still have a concern what you are proposing because…a lot of us think that it’s going to affect our animals, what we eat.”
Nigel Qaumariaq, an Inuk from Iqaluit, attended the hearings held in all four communities. At the final hearing, held in Iqaluit, he stated, “to think that there’s any support from any communities, that is very wrong. There has been moments where there’s this tug and pull between modern and traditional way but I have not seen any support for this project.”
“So therefore, I will say I will use my every last ounce of energy to make sure that this project doesn’t go ahead until the communities are comfortable.”
For many Inuit at the hearings, the issue is much bigger than this specific proposal. A major source of concern and opposition is the potential impacts of the oil development the seismic survey will facilitate.
Ezekiel Muktar* from Pond Inlet told the NEB, “Drilling in ocean, I don’t want that to take place at all and I want to be heard about that.”
“This area is only for hunting. It is only — it is our only hunting ground and we are very protective of this area and it would be great if you could move off to your other projects. This area, the ocean is our only hunting area and the land, the animals will be affected. So, somehow, your projects, papers, letters, take them and go home and don’t come me back into this area. It’s no good — this project is no good for me.”
Concerns with the inability to clean up potential oil spills in the Arctic Ocean were prominent. At the hearing in Pond Inlet, Cornelius Kadloo Nutanik* said, “Right now, I don’t want to give approval because of this reason. There are no equipment to clean things up that — when there’s a ship that can clean up a mess, a big mess, then we can start giving approval. That there’s nothing — no equipment like that right now and nothing to clean up oils if — and in Pond Inlet, there’s no — nothing to clean up — clean things up.”
These broader concerns with opening the Baffin region to oil development are not considered in the NEB assessment, due to its narrow assessment of cumulative impacts. The scope of the review states that consideration of the cumulative effects of other activities “will be limited to those for which formal plans or applications have been made.”
In Pond Inlet, some concerns were related to narwhal becoming stranded in sea ice in 2008 after seismic surveys were conducted. Roughly 500 narwhals were stranded in a fiord as sea ice formed, and over 400 had to be culled by local hunters.
Joshua Arreak*, a resident of Pond Inlet, told the NEB, “in 2008 we had narwhal frozen in, and apparently there have been seismic activity in Baffin Bay at that time. We understand that narwhal flee activity. Well, marine wildlife flee, especially narwhal, flee activity. And we understood that they were frozen and due to seismic activity.”
Biologists have also identified seismic surveys as a potential cause of the entrapment, and have called for further studies on the effects of seismic surveys on narwhal before further surveys are carried out.
Baffin Island is home to an expanding commercial fishing industry. The four major territorial organizations are the Arctic Fishery Alliance (AFA), the Baffin Fishery Coalition (BFC), Cumberland Sound Fisheries Ltd., and the Qikiqtaaluk Corporation. Collectively, these organizations hold Nunavut’s shrimp and turbot quota. The commercial fishery is an important source of employment for Inuit throughout Baffin Island.
BFC outlined the fishing industry’s concerns with seismic surveys in a presentation at the 2012 Nunavut Petroleum Workshop. The presentation indicated that the key concerns are the potential for fish to disperse while seismic surveys are conducted, and a related reduction in harvest for commercial fishers. The BFC also called for increased communication between the fishing industry and the seismic consortium, and a clear compensation package in the event of reductions in harvest. These concerns were voiced by the BFC, the AFA, and the Government of Nunavut in submissions to the National Energy Board’s review of the seismic proposal.
Concerns with a lack of a firm compensation package were also a concern at the public hearings. Some felt that there was no clear avenue for Inuit to be compensated if the proposed survey affects the marine mammals and fish that the communities rely on for subsistence harvesting.
Nigel Qaumariaq told the NEB in Iqaluit, “The company has been dodging it and avoiding compensation issues that Inuit have been bringing up. They’ll say, “The company will respond. Come talk to us”. That’s not acceptable. That is not acceptable because the company will say, “Prove it”. Then you have to go to science to prove it. No other mechanism, no other mechanism to determine what the effects will be.”
The question of local benefits was a common theme at the public hearings. Nigel Qaumariaq told the NEB, “That’s the biggest concern right now is: How can Inuit benefit? Because, right now, Inuit will not get anything outside of the NSA, according to our Land Claim. It’s just not there.”
Because the proposed survey lies outside of the Nunavut Settlement Area, there does not seem to be any mechanism to ensure local communities substantially benefit from the proposal. Royalties and taxes will inevitably flow out of the region, and there is no requirement for the consortium to negotiate an impact and benefit agreement with communities.
The consortium will have to submit a benefit plan to Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada, which may include commitments to local hiring and contracting. The consortium has committed to training and hiring marine mammal observers and community liaison workers from nearby communities. The consortium also claims it has discussed “other possible benefits with the Hamlet councils and we will continue to do so.” These discussions do not appear to be available on the public record. However, the fact that Clyde River’s Hamlet council has reaffirmed its opposition to the proposal implies that the Hamlet is not satisfied with the consortium’s plans for local benefits.
The training and employment to which they’ve committed themselves only amounts to a few temporary and seasonal jobs. Given the potential for negative impacts and lack of substantial community benefits, it is difficult to see this proposal as “development”. Simple robbery seems to be a much more apt description of what the consortium is proposing, from the perspective at least some Northerners. As the Hamlet of Pangnirtung explained during a meeting in 2012, “We have everything to lose and nothing to gain – we would be crazy to support it.”
The high degree of opposition to the proposal is likely due in part to the fact that the consortium seems unable to properly engage with Inuit communities. Some of the public information meetings the consortium held were so poorly planned that no one from the public attended.
The consortium neglected to bring environmental specialists to the public hearings, making them unable to respond to even the most basic of questions from the public about the potential impacts of the project. This was highlighted clearly in an exchange between Iqaluit resident Nigel Qaumariaq and Garry Morrow, a representative of the consortium.
Mr. Qaumariaq asked “I want to know from the company if it will affect walrus migration routes. And what information they have — do not refer me to the environmental impact statement, please tell me. And I don’t want to hear it afterwards.” Mr. Morrow responded, “Yes. We don’t have the answer for you.”
Mr. Qaumariaq went on to ask what affects the project might have on various species of seal. Mr. Morrow responded, “We don’t have an answer for you on that.”
Mr. Qaumariaq then asked what affects the project might have on Polar Bears. Mr. Morrow responded, “As you probably know, we’re here for the operations and so I know you didn’t want to hear but the environmental assessment’s been filed. So we’re more the operations guys, you know. I’m an operations person; so…”
It is, therefore, not surprising that the October 2013 submission from the QIA stated, in no uncertain terms, “The consultation strategy adopted by the proponents to date has not been effective to properly address the communities’ questions and concerns.”
Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada has responded to the QIA’s call for a strategic environmental assessment to be held on the question of offshore oil development near Baffin Island. Preliminary meetings were held in Baffin communities in February of 2014. At this point, there is no on-line public registry or other source of publicly available information on the strategic environmental assessment’s scope or process. Given the significance of the issues the process is intended to address – the wisdom of opening Baffin Bay and Davis Strait to oil and gas development – some would likely argue that the assessment should be transparent.
Meanwhile, the NEB assessment of the proposed seismic survey continues. In an e-mail dated February 26, 2014, a representative of the NEB indicated that it is in the process of reviewing submissions and will make its decision once this review is complete. The e-mail also indicated that the assessment will continue, despite AANDC’s strategic environmental assessment.
“The NEB is required to assess applications that are before the Board on a case-by-case basis. The Board’s determination of the Project’s potential for significant environmental impacts under the Canada Oil and Gas Operations Act (COGOA) is independent of possible or pending strategic or regional assessments and planning or management processes, although such information would be considered if it were available and appropriate.”
The consortium has begun advertising job openings for the proposed project in local media. According to the advertisement, “Work is planned to commence in August 2014”.
Concern and opposition regarding offshore seismic surveys is a global issue and by no means limited to Nunavut.
Biologists have raised concerns about the impact of surveys on fish and marine mammals in Nova Scotia. Media sources and marine biologists have speculated that offshore seismic surveys are responsible for stranding and killing whales in New Zealand, Iceland, and Ghana. Research from Norway suggests that seismic surveys cause fish to disperse, resulting in massive declines in cod catch for local fisheries.
In South Africa, concerns that offshore seismic surveys may lead to disruptions in sea mammal migration routes, preventing them from reaching breeding and feeding grounds and potentially causing strandings and deaths, led to the government suspending a proposed survey.
In Trinidad and Tobago, fishers received over $75 million in compensation payments between 2010 and 2013. Despite the payment of compensation, many fishers from the island nation remain resolutely opposed to the surveys and are becoming increasingly confrontational in their opposition. In September of 2013, a group called Fishermen and Friends of the Sea wrote to the government, requesting that seismic surveys be halted until a proper environmental impact study is conducted. Protests were held in October and November of 2013. In January 2014, local fishers engaged in direction action, leading a flotilla of fishing vessels to obstruct seismic surveys.
In the United States, marine conservation group Oceana submitted a petition in September of 2013, calling on the government to stop the proposed use of seismic surveys off the Atlantic Coast. In February of 2014, over 100 scientists signed a letter submitted to President Obama by Oceana, urging him to halt the Atlantic seismic proposal until new acoustic guidelines for marine mammals are developed.
Indigenous Peoples are putting their bodies on the line and it's our responsibility to make sure you know why. That takes time, expertise and resources - and we're up against a constant tide of misinformation and distorted coverage. By supporting IC you're empowering the kind of journalism we need, at the moment we need it most. . The Inuit community of Clyde River has restated its opposition to a proposal by the oil industry to conduct offshore seismic surveys near the community’s hunting grounds. The proposal is currently being assessed by the National Energy Board (NEB), and Nunavut communities are waiting for the board to finish analyzing submissions and make a decision on the file. Residents of several communities on Baffin Island have repeatedly opposed this proposal since it was first brought forward in 2011. Nunavut’s Inuit organizations have recommended the proposal not be approved until a Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) is conducted on the broader question of oil and gas development in the area. Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada has initiated an SEA, and preliminary meetings were held in Baffin communities in February 2014. However, the NEB has indicated that the SEA process will not alter its assessment of the proposed seismic survey. The consortium proposing the survey has begun advertising job openings for the proposed project in local media, with an expected start date of August 2014.
On February 25, 2014, the Hamlet Council and Hunters and Trappers Organization of Clyde River passed a joint motion, reaffirming their opposition to offshore oil and gas exploration and development, including seismic surveys. The motion stated that, as elected representatives of the community, both organizations have a “responsibility to protect the environment and safeguard our traditional way of life from rampant or unwanted development.” The motion goes on to state that at recent consultation meetings in the community “it was clearly, unequivocally and adamantly articulated…that our community is FIRMLY against any such oil and gas activity in our area and throughout Nunavut.” The resolution concludes that “both the Municipal Government and the Hunters and Trappers Organization of Clyde River speak in one voice, clearly opposing the proposed oil and gas seismic activity.”
This resolution follows a previous joint motion and letter by the Clyde River Hamlet and HTO in May of 2013, also opposing seismic surveys in the area. The joint letter made clear that the community was not against development or mineral extraction in general. “Like all Nunavut communities, we need and support economic and other opportunities that contribute towards enhanced levels of employment for our people”. However, it also made clear that the Inuit of Clyde River wish to balance economic development and wage labour opportunities with maintaining subsistence hunting. “Regardless of any economic development, we will need to protect and sustain our 4000 year plus old culture of subsistence harvesting in this region.” The letter argued that proposed oil and gas activity was not consistent with this balance. “The proposed seismic testing and the resulting oil and gas development it would bring are not balanced development. It is utterly against the global movement to decrease global warming and to decrease our dependence on fossil fuels”. It concluded by stating that the Hamlet and HTO are “firmly opposed to seismic testing in Baffin Bay and Davis Strait”.
The current proposal was submitted by a consortium of three companies – TGS-NOPEC Geophysical Company ASA, Petroleum GeoServices and Multi Klient Invest AS (“the consortium”). Officially titled the “2011 Northeastern Canada 2D Marine Seismic Survey”, the proposal is to conduct seismic surveys in Baffin Bay and Davis Strait. The project would take place seasonally over five years, and is intended to identify potential oil deposits below the ocean floor.
This work would involve a ship using air guns to blast loud bursts of sound under the water. Sensors would then detect and record the way sound bounces off the ocean floor, providing information about underwater geology. The data collected would then be sold by the consortium, to the oil industry, which would use it to locate potential oil and gas deposits to begin exploratory drilling.
The proposal overlaps with important habitat and migration routes for various species of marine mammal Inuit harvest for subsistence. The offshore fishing grounds for Nunavut’s commercial fishery also overlap with the proposed survey lines. This has led to serious concerns that the loud noise emitted during surveys may alter the migration routes or physically damage the hearing of marine mammals. It has likewise caused concern that the surveys may cause fish to disperse, causing reduced catches for the local commercial fishery.
The consortium submitted an environmental impact statement in April of 2011. Nexus Coastal Resource Management, a consulting firm established by professionals from Dalhousie University, was hired by the consortium to engage with communities. Following a long period of information requests, the NEB held hearings in four Baffin Island communities in April and May of 2013. Final comments and the consortium’s responses were submitted in early November of 2013. The NEB is in the process of assessing the submissions in order to reject or approve the proposal.

Our Sustainability Commitment
This commitment translates into four fundamental objectives, which are the foundation of our Sustainable Development Policy:
Operate a safe and healthy workplace: We aim to operate a safe and healthy workplace that is injury and fatality free. We believe that if we all work together, we can achieve zero accidents in the workplace and enhance the well-being of employees, contractors and communities.
Protect our environment: We aim to eliminate, minimize and mitigate impacts of our operations on the environment and maintain its viability and diversity.
Respect our employees: We aim to maintain a safe and healthy work environment that is based on mutual respect, fairness and integrity.
Respect our communities: We aim to contribute to the social and economic development of sustainable communities that are associated with our operations.
We integrate sustainable development considerations into our business strategy as well as in the way we plan and manage our activities. Our strategy and reporting program targets five areas: governance matters; health, safety and wellness of employees and contractors; environmental issues related to waste and water management, tailings, biodiversity and mine closures; our employee; and, stakeholder engagement and direct economic value.
We regularly review our Sustainable Development Policy and in 2019, we updated it to reflect our commitments to the new Towards Sustainable Mining (TSM) water management protocol and the World Council’s Responsible Gold Mining Principles (RGMP). Our Sustainable Development Policy is communicated to all employees during their orientation and is available on our Intranet and website, as well as at our operations and offices in the local language.
Standards and Disclosures
Agnico Eagle is committed to maintaining high standards in sustainability and achieving global best practices in transparency and disclosures.
We have designed our Risk Management and Monitoring System (RMMS) - our in-house health, safety, environment and social acceptability management system - for managing the commitments made in our Sustainable Development Policy.
The RMMS is consistent with the ISO 14001 Environmental Management System and the OHSAS 18001 Health and Safety Management System. We are not planning to seek certification under the ISO or OSHA standards at this time.
For more information on how we are integrating these sustainability standards, codes and disclosures into our daily operations to ensure we are not only meeting, but exceeding, regulatory requirements for health, safety and the environment we invite you to see our annualSustainable Development Report.
With RMMS, we ensure the following compliance requirements and industry standards are met: . The Meadowbank Complex refers to the mining, processing and infrastructure at the Meadowbank mine site combined with the mining and infrastructure at the nearby Amaruq site. The remote Meadowbank mine camp, with recreational and fitness facilities, can host more than 500 employees at a time. The Amaruq camp can host an additional 350 employees.
The Meadowbank gold mine achieved commercial production in March 2010 and produced its three millionth ounce of gold in 2018 and 2019 was the final year of production at the Meadowbank mine.
The 117,820-hectare Amaruq property is located approximately 50 km northwest of the Meadowbank mine site. Discovered in 2013, Amaruq hosts the Whale Tail gold deposit as well as the V and Mammoth zones and several other targets. At December 31, 2019, the Amaruq satellite deposit at Meadowbank was estimated to contain open pit proven and probable mineral reserves of 2.7 million ounces of gold (22.8 million tonnes grading 3.74 g/t), underground probable mineral reserves of 577,000 ounces of gold (3.3 million tonnes grading 5.43 g/t), as well as substantial open pit and underground indicated and inferred mineral resources.
The Amaruq mining operation uses the existing infrastructure at the Meadowbank mine (mining equipment, mill, tailings facilities, camp and airstrip). Additional infrastructure has been built at the Amaruq site (truck shop/warehouse, fuel storage and a larger camp facility). Amaruq ore is transported using long haul off-road type trucks to the mill at the Meadowbank facilities for processing. The Company declared commercial production at the Whale Tail pit at Amaruq on September 30, 2019.
The life of mine plan for the Whale Tail pit calls for the production of approximately 2.5 million ounces of gold between 2019 and 2026.
Permitting for the Amaruq Phase 2 expansion, including an open pit at the V Zone and underground operations, is ongoing. If this expansion is approved, it would increase production rates and further extend the mine life for the Meadowbank Complex.
Geology
The Meadowbank and Amaruq properties are underlain by Archean-age volcanic and sedimentary rocks of the Woodburn Lake Group. This is within the Rae domain of the Western Churchill geological province of the Canadian Shield. These rocks were possibly deposited in a continental rift setting and consist of mafic to ultramafic volcanic rocks interlayered with carbon-rich sedimentary rocks. The rock sequence has since been intruded by granitoid rocks and lamprophyres, and has been affected by multiple phases of ductile deformation along with metamorphism to greenschist facies and locally to the upper greenschist facies.
Mineralization
Gold deposits at the Meadowbank property are found along two main structural features that cross the property: the Meadowbank Trend and the Pipedream Lake (Northeast) Trend. The Meadowbank Trend hosts the Goose, Portage and Vault deposits, which were the sites of mining. The Goose and Portage deposits are hosted by magnetite-rich iron formation, while intermediate volcanic rocks host most of the mineralization at the Vault deposit farther north. Both the rock units and the gold deposits are tightly folded and structurally complex, sandwiched between granitic plutons. These shallow deposits lie within 7 km of each other. In all deposits, gold mineralization is commonly associated with intense quartz flooding, and the presence of sulphide minerals (pyrite and/or pyrrhotite).
At the Amaruq property, three significant zones of gold-bearing quartz-pyrrhotite-arsenopyrite veining/flooding within volcano-sedimentary rocks have been discovered: the Whale Tail, V and Mammoth zones. The Whale Tail and V zones appear to be offset mineralized corridors striking east-northeast to northeast and dipping moderately to steeply southeast.
The Whale Tail deposit has been defined over at least 2.3 km of strike length and from surface to 915 m depth; it includes the Whale Tail ore shoot in the mineralized chert-iron formation sequence plunging shallowly east-to-northeast. Whale Tail remains open at depth and along strike.
Immediately north of Whale Tail, the V Zone consists of a series of parallel stacked mineralized structures striking northeast and extending from near surface to as deep as 707 m below surface; the southeast dip of the structures is approximately 30 degrees near surface and steepens to 60 to 70 degrees at depth, where there are at least two sub-parallel structures. The V Zone ore shoot, defined in 2018, is a mineralized corridor 100 to 150 m wide, locally more than 300 m wide, plunging shallowly eastward, extending from approximately 350 m to more than 700 m depth.
Mining
The Company has conducted surface mining at Meadowbank from a series of three pits all within 7 km of the processing plant. Water retention dikes were built to allow for mining beneath shallow lakes. The mine operated year-round using conventional drilling, blasting, and truck-and-shovel methods. Waste rock was used for construction or placed in waste storage sites or previously mined-out areas. To minimize acid generation, the sulphide-bearing waste rock is encapsulated in permafrost and capped with an insulating layer of neutralizing rock. Mining concluded at the Meadowbank site in 2019.
A conventional open-pit mining operation has been developed on the Whale Tail deposit at the Amaruq site, with ore being transported using long haul off-road type trucks to the mill at the Meadowbank facilities for processing. Following construction of two associated water retention dikes, mining from the Whale Tail pit began in the first quarter of 2019 with mining rates ramping up throughout the rest of 2019.
An exploration ramp started at Amaruq in early 2018 has improved the efficiency of evaluating the potential for an underground operation, accelerating drilling activities designed to infill and convert mineral resources and to expand the deposits.
Processing
The 11,000-tonnes/day Meadowbank gold processing plant uses conventional technology adjusted to the Arctic climate. After two stages of crushing and grinding, any ""free gold"" is then removed by a gravity circuit. The remainder is leached using cyanide, with the gold captured using carbon-in-pulp technology and electrowinning cells. Gold-plated cathodes and gravity concentrate are smelted in an induction furnace and poured as doré bars. The plant includes both a cyanide recycling thickener and a sulphur-dioxide-air cyanide destruction circuit to ensure that no cyanide escapes to the environment. Tailings from the Meadowbank mine have been placed in the permanent tailings facility. All water from the tailings pond is pumped back to the plant for reuse, making this a zero-discharge system. The processing of ore from the Portage pit and stockpiles at Meadowbank was completed during the fourth quarter of 2019.
Modifications to the processing plant to treat Amaruq ore were completed in the first quarter of 2019 — specifically, the addition of a gravity preconcentration process followed by a regrind mill. The plant is expected to operate at 9,000 to 10,000 tonnes/day processing Amaruq ore once mining ramp-up is completed. Gold recovery is expected to be 93% for Whale Tail ore and 95% for V Zone ore.
Permitting for in-pit disposal of the Meadowbank mill tailings in the depleted Meadowbank pits was received and in-pit tailings deposition began in July 2019.
Exploration
The Whale Tail deposit has been defined over at least 2.3 km of strike length and from surface to 915 m depth.
The conversion drilling program continues to demonstrate the extension of high-grade mineralization below the proposed pit outline, while the level of confidence in the geological model continues to improve.
In 2019, drilling from the exploration ramp into the Whale Tail North Zone, below the existing mineral resources in the eastern part of Whale Tail, has shown the potential for the development of new mineral resources approximately 100 m north of the Whale Tail underground mineral resources at depth.
The Whale Tail deposit remains open to the west at depth, and to the east along a shallow plunge corresponding to the main ore shoot. A small portion of Amaruq's current mineral reserves and mineral resources are in the Whale Tail North structure.
The V Zone consists of a series of parallel, stacked mineralized structures striking northeast from near surface to as deep as 707 m below surface. The dip of the structures is approximately 30 degrees near surface, and steepens to 60 to 70 degrees at depth, where there are at least two sub-parallel structures. The V Zone ore shoot is a mineralized corridor 100 to 300 m wide plunging shallowly to the northeast and extending from approximately 350 m to more than 700 m depth. In second half of 2019, conversion and exploration drilling continued to return positive results along the interpreted V Zone ore shoot.
In 2020, the Company expects to test regional targets at Amaruq with a focus on open-pit potential, as well as other near-surface targets close to existing road infrastructure between Amaruq and Baker Lake. . The Meliadine mine is located near the western shore of Hudson Bay in the Kivalliq District of Nunavut, about 25 km north of Rankin Inlet and 290 km southeast of our Meadowbank mine. Meliadine includes seven gold deposits, six of which are part of the current mine plan. The 111,357-hectare property covers an 80-km-long greenstone belt.
Commercial production began at Meliadine on May 14, 2019. The Company anticipates that mining at Meliadine will be carried out through several underground mining operations and open pits over a 14-year mine life. There are numerous opportunities to create additional value at Meliadine, both at the mine and on the large regional land package.
Geology
Archean volcanic and sedimentary rocks of the Rankin Inlet greenstone belt underlie the property. The rock layers have been folded, sheared and metamorphosed. They trend west-northwest, dip steeply to the north, and have been overturned. The rock units are truncated by the Pyke Fault, a regional structure that extends the entire 80-km length of the property
Mineralization
The Pyke Fault and associated secondary structures (i.e., the Lower Fault) appear to control gold mineralization on the property. Along the fault is a series of oxide iron formations that host six of the seven known Meliadine mine deposits. The deposits consist of multiple lodes of mesothermal quartz-vein stockwork, laminated veins and sulphidized iron formation mineralization. The northern, magnetite-rich Upper Oxide iron formation hosts the Tiriganiaq zone, the largest deposit to date with a strike length of approximately 3.0 km at surface and a known depth of 800 m, as well as the Wolf North and Discovery zones. The southern, weakly magnetic Lower Lean iron formations contain the F Zone, Pump, Wolf Main and Wesmeg deposits. Normeg is hosted by mafic volcanics and is located between the Wesmeg and Tiriganiaq zones.
The deposits are all within 5 km of Tiriganiaq except for Discovery, which is 17 km east-southeast of Tiriganiaq. Each of these deposits has mineralization within 120 m of surface, making them potentially mineable by open pit methods. They also have deeper mineralization that could potentially be mined with underground methods, which are currently being considered in various studies.
Mining
In Phase 1 of the mine, the ore is being sourced entirely from underground with access by decline, using long-hole mining methods. The first three stopes were blasted and mucked out in late 2018. Each stope is backfilled, with cemented pastefill used in primary stopes and dry rockfill for the secondary stopes. A saline water treatment plant treats underground dewatering water; the Company received the necessary approval to discharge the treated saline water to Hudson Bay commencing in the third quarter of 2019.
The current Meliadine mill has shown that it can operate well in excess of its nameplate 3,750 tonnes per day capacity. As a result, the Company has decided to accelerate the Phase 2 expansion to utilize this extra mill capacity. The initial source of open pit ore will be from two pits developed on the Tiriganiaq deposit, which contain probable mineral reserves of 590,412 ounces of gold (3.8 million tonnes grading 4.89 g/t gold).
Processing
Initial ore processing commenced in early February 2019 using low-grade stockpiles. The mill employs a conventional gold circuit comprising crushing, grinding, gravity separation and cyanide leaching with a carbon-in-leach circuit, followed by cyanide destruction and filtration of the tailings for dry stacking. Metallurgical recoveries are expected to average 96%. Phase 1 mill capacity is approximately 3,750 tonnes/day, increasing in Phase 2 to approximately 6,000 tonnes/day.
Exploration
Exploration drilling is currently conducted from surface, while conversion drilling is being done from surface and underground set-ups along the ramps. Additional drilling is planned to expand and upgrade the existing mineral resource base in the immediate mine area. . The Meadowbank Complex refers to the mining, processing and infrastructure at the Meadowbank mine site combined with the mining and infrastructure at the nearby Amaruq site. The remote Meadowbank mine camp, with recreational and fitness facilities, can host more than 500 employees at a time. The Amaruq camp can host an additional 350 employees.

Was there for almost 2 years and drove B Trains scaling out at 213tons! The fun part is driving these huge trucks in the Artic. Ice roads narrow sections steep grades! Was a challenge. Guys are great but awful management. For example our superintendent had zero experience driving trucks. And said on more then one occasion if you don't like it here there are plenty of jobs down south! We stay in large dome tents with communal bathrooms while at port. Mery river has hard wall camp with every room having a onsuit bathrooms! That is nice but merry river has poor food and and poor cleaning service. Port camp is run by Horizons and well looked after.... it's also a large ⛺ tent in the artic! There is a union but there awful. They are not a strong union and upper management always has the upper hand. To be honest most of my time there was exciting! But it is a mine in the artic. They have their own rules and upper management cares only about production not the employees. There have been 3 deaths in 5 years of operation and one suicide on site. The one guy was run over at start of his shift and no one realized until after shift change.... this poor guy was repeatedly run over for 12 hours by huge loders no one knew until they found his bloody coveralls in the morning. Let that sink In for a sec.....very high turn over rate.
Pros
21 days on 21 off rotation money is ok.
Cons
Poor upper management!
Always rushing to get things in order before mine inspector came. Management Doesn't care about safety until it suits them. Multiple people had lost time incidents and 1 person died while I was employed there. Flight delays often in different seasons. Camp is OK food sucks. They use to make you sleep in a tent most of them had mold. They decommissioned the tents about 1 year ago though.
Pros
Don't have to pay for anything while you're there
Worked there as a contractor 2919/2020 people who i worked with were great, 2019 was a great season, 2020 not so. Got let go one rotation before holidays without proper reasons, management is hypocritical and not reliable, if you’re not part of the click you won’t last long... No room for any mistake for contractors feel like shelf meat. No job security what so ever, you can’t even explain or get any explanation if you did wrong, you’re out and, end of story, next !!! That’s how easy it is to get replaced... Would never recommend this place...
Pros
Good food, great co workers, 14/14 ate great shifts
Cons
Poor management, training program is a joke, hypocritical management, next to no advancement possible
Great bunch of employees
Management sucks couldn’t organize a cluster f$&@ in a wh0&@ house
Safety only matters during the meeting or if it’s effecting their bottom line

Pros
Other employees were great to work with
Cons
Management
They waited until two hours before my flight back to work to let me know I was fired and said I would be reimbursed for my flight. I was never reimbursed nor did I get the things I left on sight. Developed ptsd after putting a ore truck off the road and being fired but still for all there was three other trucks off the road that week that sustained damage and down time but my truck didn’t . So because I was fired had no benefits or way to get the help needed to recover it took two years to recover
Pros
Met and worked with some wonderful people, got to experience life in the arctic
Cons
no Second chances, harsh weather
great place to work
co-workers were good, family feel
Food was great, good selection and healthy choices
options for growth within the company
climate was exceptional

Cette entreprise met en place une exploitation hors du commun et y participer a été très enrichisaant à tous le spoints de vue.
Lots of favoritism . Planes for flights to and from site are hit and miss for being on time. Disorganized. Camp accommodations are good and food is ok.
Tools at the port site for mechanics were pretty hard to come by. If you were going to leave the shop for anything, you had to lock up your box or stuff would disappear. Other than that, it's just what you would expect working in the arctic.

Date modified: 2018-06-19 . Abstract: With Inuit identifying as a people beyond nation-state boundaries, and Nunavummiut and Greenlanders as citizens of Canada and Denmark, the right to self-determination has followed distinct trajectories in the jurisdictions examined in my thesis. Nunavut has a constitutional mandate to be responsive to the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement, paradoxically intensifying the relationships with the federal government towards further devolution and maintaining an ethnic divide trespassing territorial lines. Envisioning statehood, Greenland has chosen to gradually break economic ties with Denmark and in mainstreaming its governance capacity it appears to be branching off ethnocentric policies. In what seem opposing pathways, autonomous postsecondary education institutions are positioned to mitigate the notional extremes the right to self-determination calls upon. By comparing institutions steering through conflicting missions, this thesis illustrates the ways in which the right to self-determination operates against the backdrop of regained geopolitical prominence of the Arctic Region. Applying a legal theoretical framework to the scholarship of indigenous education this thesis raises a number of issues in carrying forward the right to self-determination once indigenous peoples regain control over their destinies. Issues regarding social stratification challenging the politics of representation indicate that achieving some form of autonomy does not necessarily result in social justice as the indigenous rights advocacy scholarship suggests. Considering the Inuit right to self-determination as a process right rather than an outcome, this finding highlights internal pluralities challenging the reification of Inuit identity on the basis of cultural, political, and socioeconomic difference. This thesis advocates for examining the contingencies that shape Inuit multiple allegiances accounting for peoples vantage geopolitical positioning. As Inuit redefine their position in the local, national, and global spheres, important knowledge is produced overcoming the single overriding of identity politics. Recognizing that Inuit knowledge is knowledge in context, the author contends, may lead to new ways for postsecondary education to uphold the Inuit right to self-determination.

Website: . Nunavut Food Security Symposium
In June 2012, the Nunavut Food Security Coalition was established to develop a long term, ongoing, inclusive, and sustainable approach to food security in Nunavut. In January 2013, the Nunavut Food Security Symposium was held in Iqaluit in order to engage a broad group of partners to determine which policies, programs, and initiatives are most likely to improve food security in Nunavut. The symposium brought together 135 people who represented government departments, Inuit associations, NGOs, retailers, HTOs, community-based organizations, and academic institutions. Panel discussions, presentations, and working sessions were built around six themes identified by the Nunavut Food Security Coalition: country food access, market food access, life skills, programs and community initiative, local food production, as well as policy and legislation. After three days of productive dialogue, Nunavut-based partners emerged with priority areas for action on each theme. These priorities will be used to inform the Nunavut Food Security Strategy, which is expected to be announced in spring 2013. An associated implementation plan and evaluation framework will be developed in junction with the strategy to ensure that we continue to do more with what we have so we can increase food security among Nunavummiut.

Dispute reminiscent of lead-up to the Arctic Council’s 2017 Fairbanks ministerial meeting
As the Arctic Council prepares to convene its biennial ministerial meeting in Rovaniemi, Finland next week, representatives from the United States have clashed with those of other Arctic Council member states over the issue of climate change, potentially jeopardizing the joint declaration traditionally issued at the conclusion of such meetings, according to several reports.
The disagreement first came to light last month, as officials were set to meet in Espoo, Finland to finalize the joint declaration. Days before that event, while speaking at an Arctic conference in St. Petersburg, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told state wire service TASS that the U.S. sought to block mention of not just climate change, but also of the Paris Agreement on climate and the United Nations’ 2030 sustainable development goals.
“All others are confident that the strategy will be watered down if we fail to do that. So serious work lies ahead,” Lavrov said.
The dispute mirrors a similar one in the run-up to the Fairbanks Ministerial two years ago, pointed out Eye on the Arctic, after the Espoo meeting failed to bring an agreement on language for the 2019 declaration.
In 2017, after similar last-minute disagreements then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson eventually signed a declaration that mentioned both climate change and the Paris accord—though not without reluctance. At that time, the Trump administration hadn’t yet formally announced plans to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, though it had been publicly flirting with the idea for some time, and Tillerson heard plenty of public pushback on the subject in Fairbanks.
This year’s Arctic Council ministerial meeting is the first since the U.S. announced its withdrawal from the climate accord, and U.S. officials have renewed their push against climate change language. According to the most recent report, from the Washington Post, which cites several unnamed diplomats, the U.S. sought to remove any mention of climate change at all. One of those diplomats told the post that the U.S. “indicated its resistance to any mention of climate change whatsoever.”
Those diplomats acknowledged, however, that as the ministerial draws closer, the U.S. has softened its stance. And in comments to both the Post and Eye on the Arctic, Finnish Ambassador Aleksi Härkönen, who is chair of the Senior Arctic Officials, said he was optimistic a deal would eventually be reached.
“There is a willingness on all sides to achieve a result, to be able to get a declaration all can agree on,” he told the Post. “I sense the willingness to make compromises. I believe this will be the outcome. But we are not there yet.”

“Arctic indigenous peoples deserve more than to be treated as spectators to their own lives”
Greenpeace is now taking Clyde River’s fight against seismic testing off the coast of Baffin Island to the United Nations.
Greenpeace Canada, keen to build partnerships with Inuit and First Nations on environmental causes, made a speech at the United Nations July 15 in an event that focused on climate change and sustainable development.
“Climate change is very much alive and present in the North, and naturally, so is industry. As the ice retreats, Big Oil is banging down our doors for permission to conduct seismic testing as a step towards drilling for oil,” said Kiera-Dawn Kolson, a Dene woman and Greenpeace’s Arctic outreach campaigner in Yellowknife.
“Even when communities say no, as they are now in Clyde River, industry is exploiting its relationship with the federal government, and the National Energy Board is ignoring the communities they pretend to listen to, and going ahead with the seismic testing in spite of mass opposition.”
Jerry Natanine, mayor of Clyde River, and Niore Iqalukjuak, are currently mobilizing support for a campaign to stop not just seismic testing off shore of their community — something that was recently approved by the National Energy Board — but underwater oil and gas exploration which they believe will soon follow once seismic data identifies seabed reservoirs.
They are circulating a petition, which you can find on their Fight Against Seismic Testing in Nunavut Facebook page, and are also organizing a protest on July 23 at 1 p.m. in Clyde River.
They are hoping Nunavummiut in other communities protest in solidarity on the same day.
Kolson made her speech at the UN’s headquarters in New York City at a United Nations side event that accompanied the 13th Session of the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals.
That side event — A Global Call Spanning the Polar Regions to the Tropics — was organized by mostly indigenous and environmental groups including the permanent missions of Peru and Solomon Islands, the UN Non-Governmental Liaison Service, the Natural Resources Defence Council and Greenpeace.
“Many First Nations, Inuit and Metis communities in northern Canada are still living in third and fourth world conditions without basic human rights,” Kolson said. “And industry knows this and exploits this to its advantage. Because people need food now. They need a roof over their kids’ heads tonight.”
With words that echo a lively, and hourly, exchange of ideas on the seismic testing protest page on Facebook, that was created by Iqalukjuak, Kolson talks about the need for northerners to take control of their own future.
“We are of the land and the land is of us and Arctic indigenous peoples deserve more than to be treated as spectators to their own lives. Rather than perpetuating the cycle of need that locks us into unsustainable boom-bust projects, we must make space that enables communities to focus on long term solutions and sustainable development.”

CanArctic Inuit Networks says it can bring high-speed internet to the territory more cheaply and without depending on Huawei gear
The path leading to a better Nunavut telecom system may well run under the ocean — through undersea bundles of fibre-optic cable.
But which route will Nunavut end up with?
The emergence of a $107-million undersea fibre-optic cable proposal late last December called SednaLink, unveiled by a new private firm called CanArctic Inuit Networks Inc., gives Nunavut another option for freeing the territory from slow, unreliable satellite networks and achieving parity with southern Canada.
It also might mean the possible demise of the Government of Nunavut’s $209.5-million proposal to install its own fibre-optic cable between Iqaluit and Nuuk, Greenland.
At least, that’s according to CanArctic’s two partners, chief executive officer Doug Cunningham of Toronto and chief operating officer Madeleine Redfern of Iqaluit.
Cheaper, more secure?
Cunningham and Redfern say their proposal requires no spending by the Government of Nunavut.
The GN, according to its 2021-22 capital estimates, has already spent $4 million in preparatory work on its Nuuk-Iqaluit cable project, and plans to spend another $54.5 million. The federal government is expected to contribute the remaining $151 million.
The territorial government has not issued a request for proposals on the project, according to its 2020-23 business plan.
“We can bring these things in at a lower capital cost than governments,” Cunningham told Nunatsiaq News in an interview.
CanArctic also says fibre-optic cables are a safer bet than the various proposals for low-Earth-orbit satellite systems. They say satellites come at a higher price and represent an unproven technology.
Marine fibre-optic cable has roughly the same width as a garden hose. But it’s capable of transmitting vast amounts of data at the speed of light.
Cunningham says he has worked for more than 35 years in the international marine cable business. Another company he’s involved with, Crosslake Fibre, has installed fibre-optic cable across Lake Ontario and is involved in projects in North America and Europe.
He was also the CEO of an earlier company, Arctic Fibre, which pitched a fibre-optic system for the Arctic in 2012. In 2016, an Alaskan company bought the assets of Arctic Fibre and built an undersea cable along the northern Alaskan coastline.
Under the first phase of its scheme, CanArctic would install a 2,104-kilometre high-speed fibre-optic cable between Iqaluit and Clarenville, Nfld.
From there, Nunavut internet traffic would be directly connected to the networks in North America.
Nunatsiavut, Nunavik connections
Along the way, a company in Nunatsiavut would install branch lines to six locations on the northern Labrador coast: Nain, Voisey’s Bay, Natuashish, Hopedale, Makkovik and Postville.
Later, branch lines would connect with many Qikiqtani communities, as well as with Salluit, Nunavik.
CanArctic has reached out to a variety of federal government infrastructure and broadband programs to contribute roughly 75 per cent of the SednaLink project’s required financing of $107 million. It expects private sector investors will make up the rest.
Cunningham said he estimates the annual operating cost of the SednaLink cable at around $9 million.
Once it’s up and running, the company would generate revenue by selling wholesale bandwidth to existing companies like Northwestel, SSi Canada, Iristel — and even the Government of Nunavut, Cunningham said.
The Huawei connection
SednaLink comes with another potential advantage.
Under the government’s plan, internet traffic from Nunavut and Canada would flow through a marine cable containing equipment installed by Huawei Marine, a former subsidiary of the state-owned Chinese firm Huawei Technologies. The marine cable, called Greenland Connect, was laid between Nuuk and Newfoundland in 2008. It’s operated by TELE Greenland.
That Greenland Connect line was upgraded in 2017 — by Huawei Marine, which installed Huawei terminal equipment.
That means the GN plan may raise potential national security concerns, given the vast amounts of unencrypted data that would flow from Nunavut into the Greenland Connect line.
“I understand there may be some Huawei equipment attached to TELE Greenland and there are always, of course, concerns with Huawei equipment and security and privacy issues,” Redfern told Nunatsiaq News.
Many western countries fear equipment installed by Huawei Technologies, which has close ties to the Chinese government, could be used by the People’s Republic of China for various types of cyber-espionage.
For that reason, some countries have acted to limit or ban the use of Huawei equipment within new 5G next-generation cellular networks.
Huawei Technologies sold Huawei Marine in 2019 to a China-based firm called Hengtong Optic-Electric, which is partly owned by a member of China’s National People’s Congress.
But in 2019, the Washington Post reported that even under its new owner, Huawei Marine, is still perceived to be a potential threat.
Completion by 2022?
Meanwhile, CanArctic Networks hopes to get its Iqaluit-Newfoundland cable installed by November 2022 — but that’s only if financing comes together quickly.
“If we don’t get the support within the next two months, this project will be potentially delayed by another year,” Redfern said.
That’s because of the short Arctic shipping season. Laying cable and onshore preparatory work can only be done during ice-free months. . ",False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False

However, these threats are not equally distributed. Communities in Nunavut have suffered from food insecurity disproportionately to the rest of Canada for decades as a result of historical and geographic factors, which are now being compounded by the logistical and economic challenges that accompany the virus’ spread across the country.
Food insecurity is defined by the Government of Canada as “the inability to acquire or consume an adequate diet quality or sufficient quantity of food in socially acceptable ways, or the uncertainty that one will be able to do so.” Within this definition, individuals or households can be classified at different levels of insecurity, ranging from marginal to severe.Most statistics on food insecurity in Canada refer to those who are moderately or severely food insecure, indicating a “compromise in quality and/or quantity of food due to a lack of money for food” in moderate cases, and severe cases in which individuals “miss meals, reduce food intake, and at the most extreme go day(s) without food.”
COVID-19 has resulted in mass layoffs, furloughs, and hiring freezes across Canada, contributing to a rising unemployment rate and demand for government income support. This has left many Canadians with significantly reduced incomes and increasingly precarious situations. This means higher risk of falling into food insecurity, as food insecurity is strongly tied to poverty. However, specific communities are much more at risk due to pre-existing challenges with food security, which are now being compounded by the economic and logistical challenges posed by the pandemic. One study published by the Canadian Medical Association Journal found that nearly 46% of households in Nunavut, a territory in which 84.7% of the population identifies as Inuit, were living with food insecurity in 2019.
The history of food insecurity in what is now known as Nunavut can be traced back to the forced relocation of 87 Inuit from Inukjuak, located in what is now known as northern Quebec. They were relocated to the High Arctic communities of Grise Fiord and Resolute in 1953 and 1955 by the Canadian Government. These individuals were initially persuaded to voluntarily relocate with promises of better hunting on further northern land, and the option to return to Inukjuak two years later. However, the promise of better hunting was intentionally misleading, and many starved due to a lack of familiar game and vegetation, difficulty hunting during 24-hour nights, and restrictions on hunting endangered or protected species. Members of the group then requested that the RCMP allow them to return to Inukjuak, but it was revealed that the members of this group were not allowed to return to the territory of their traditional food sources.
Journalist Duncan McCue shares four photos of inflated food prices at an Iqaluit grocery store. Via Twitter.
Today, food insecurity in Nunavut is partly due to these communities’ remote geography, which increases the distance that food needs to be shipped and often requires unusual means such as flying in goods. This has resulted in massively inflated prices due to increased shipping costs. In 2016, groceries in Nunavut were sold at up to three times the price of food in the average Canadian grocery store. The government subsidy program Nutrition North Canada has attempted to address this issue through subsidies for certain foods, with little success in combating food insecurity. These high food prices reinforce high poverty rates and food insecurity in Nunavut, with disproportionately large portions of even high-income earners’ salaries going to groceries. Hunting for “country food” is a common alternative to price-inflated groceries. However, this can also be costly when the price of gas, transportation, and equipment is factored in. Additionally, hunting and fishing access is changing as climate change impacts the safety of travel routes as well as contaminants in traditional food sources.
Economic shutdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic has compounded these factors’ impact on food security. Though all provinces and territories in Canada have felt the impacts of economic shutdown, many individuals and businesses in Nunavut are heavily reliant on summer tourism, particularly Arctic cruises. Tourism companies, hotels, and other businesses who are dependent on tourist dollars have been forced to lay off dozens of workers. Some are indicating that permanent closures may occur in the future, affecting the incomes of business owners and staff. Even if these workers impacted by these closures are able to access government income support programs, they may still struggle to maintain food security in light of the high grocery prices in the territory.
Additionally, many already food insecure individuals in Nunavut relied on community meal programs, food banks, and other charitable food distribution services that have now been shut down or forced to adapt their operations to new physical distancing measures. For some programs, this means reducing personnel, reducing the number of mealtimes served, and introducing takeout systems. Nunavut has the highest rate of child poverty in Canada, and child food insecurity in Nunavut is often addressed by breakfast and lunch programs run by schools. Now, organizers for these programs are dealing with the challenge of simply maintaining services, some of which are facing increased demand as children’s caregivers’ incomes are reduced and employment statuses altered.
Finally, although Nunavut has seen no reported cases of COVID-19 as of June 12, 2020, the direct arrival of COVID-19 may threaten food security if or when COVID-19 reaches the territory. In La Loche, Saskatchewan, a largely Indigenous-populated northern town, the arrival of COVID-19 has posed a new challenge for local food security. A confirmed case of COVID-19 among employees of one of La Loche’s two grocery stores led to a temporary store closure in order to test their workers for the virus. This left residents with greatly reduced options for purchasing groceries. In the case of COVID-19 arriving in Nunavut, this may be another looming challenge to food security in the small towns of the territory.
In response to the impact of COVID-19 on food insecurity, short-term charitable efforts have been adapted, the Nutrition North Canada subsidy program expanded, and specified COVID-19 funding has been promised to Northern communities by the Federal Government. However, advocates for ending food insecurity in Canada argue that these efforts do not adequately address the root causes of food insecurity, especially in Nunavut. In their new food policy action plan created in the context of COVID-19, the organization Food Secure Canada advocates Universal Basic Income “relative to the cost of living, and indexed based on location” and support for Indigenous food sovereignty to address not only the issue of food security, but also numerous Sustainable Development Goals as outlined by the United Nations.
Nuanced policies such as these prioritize understanding of the unique cultural, geographic, and social challenges faced by specific, largely Indigenous communities across Canada. Because of this, they have the potential to address both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19-related causes of food insecurity.

Economic shutdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic has compounded these factors’ impact on food security. Though all provinces and territories in Canada have felt the impacts of economic shutdown, many individuals and businesses in Nunavut are heavily reliant on summer tourism, particularly Arctic cruises. Tourism companies, hotels, and other businesses who are dependent on tourist dollars have been forced to lay off dozens of workers. Some are indicating that permanent closures may occur in the future, affecting the incomes of business owners and staff. Even if these workers impacted by these closures are able to access government income support programs, they may still struggle to maintain food security in light of the high grocery prices in the territory.
Additionally, many already food insecure individuals in Nunavut relied on community meal programs, food banks, and other charitable food distribution services that have now been shut down or forced to adapt their operations to new physical distancing measures. For some programs, this means reducing personnel, reducing the number of mealtimes served, and introducing takeout systems. Nunavut has the highest rate of child poverty in Canada, and child food insecurity in Nunavut is often addressed by breakfast and lunch programs run by schools. Now, organizers for these programs are dealing with the challenge of simply maintaining services, some of which are facing increased demand as children’s caregivers’ incomes are reduced and employment statuses altered.
Finally, although Nunavut has seen no reported cases of COVID-19 as of June 12, 2020, the direct arrival of COVID-19 may threaten food security if or when COVID-19 reaches the territory. In La Loche, Saskatchewan, a largely Indigenous-populated northern town, the arrival of COVID-19 has posed a new challenge for local food security. A confirmed case of COVID-19 among employees of one of La Loche’s two grocery stores led to a temporary store closure in order to test their workers for the virus. This left residents with greatly reduced options for purchasing groceries. In the case of COVID-19 arriving in Nunavut, this may be another looming challenge to food security in the small towns of the territory.
In response to the impact of COVID-19 on food insecurity, short-term charitable efforts have been adapted, the Nutrition North Canada subsidy program expanded, and specified COVID-19 funding has been promised to Northern communities by the Federal Government. However, advocates for ending food insecurity in Canada argue that these efforts do not adequately address the root causes of food insecurity, especially in Nunavut. In their new food policy action plan created in the context of COVID-19, the organization Food Secure Canada advocates Universal Basic Income “relative to the cost of living, and indexed based on location” and support for Indigenous food sovereignty to address not only the issue of food security, but also numerous Sustainable Development Goals as outlined by the United Nations.
Nuanced policies such as these prioritize understanding of the unique cultural, geographic, and social challenges faced by specific, largely Indigenous communities across Canada. Because of this, they have the potential to address both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19-related causes of food insecurity.

She grew up as a settler on Treaty 7 territory, and is primarily interested in the intersections between environmental issues and social justice. . As measures to flatten the COVID-19 curve are implemented across Canada, many Canadians are not only faced with the threat of the virus, but also increased threats to their food security. However, these threats are not equally distributed. Communities in Nunavut have suffered from food insecurity disproportionately to the rest of Canada for decades as a result of historical and geographic factors, which are now being compounded by the logistical and economic challenges that accompany the virus’ spread across the country.
Food insecurity is defined by the Government of Canada as “the inability to acquire or consume an adequate diet quality or sufficient quantity of food in socially acceptable ways, or the uncertainty that one will be able to do so.” Within this definition, individuals or households can be classified at different levels of insecurity, ranging from marginal to severe.Most statistics on food insecurity in Canada refer to those who are moderately or severely food insecure, indicating a “compromise in quality and/or quantity of food due to a lack of money for food” in moderate cases, and severe cases in which individuals “miss meals, reduce food intake, and at the most extreme go day(s) without food.”
COVID-19 has resulted in mass layoffs, furloughs, and hiring freezes across Canada, contributing to a rising unemployment rate and demand for government income support. This has left many Canadians with significantly reduced incomes and increasingly precarious situations. This means higher risk of falling into food insecurity, as food insecurity is strongly tied to poverty. However, specific communities are much more at risk due to pre-existing challenges with food security, which are now being compounded by the economic and logistical challenges posed by the pandemic. One study published by the Canadian Medical Association Journal found that nearly 46% of households in Nunavut, a territory in which 84.7% of the population identifies as Inuit, were living with food insecurity in 2019.
The history of food insecurity in what is now known as Nunavut can be traced back to the forced relocation of 87 Inuit from Inukjuak, located in what is now known as northern Quebec. They were relocated to the High Arctic communities of Grise Fiord and Resolute in 1953 and 1955 by the Canadian Government. These individuals were initially persuaded to voluntarily relocate with promises of better hunting on further northern land, and the option to return to Inukjuak two years later. However, the promise of better hunting was intentionally misleading, and many starved due to a lack of familiar game and vegetation, difficulty hunting during 24-hour nights, and restrictions on hunting endangered or protected species. Members of the group then requested that the RCMP allow them to return to Inukjuak, but it was revealed that the members of this group were not allowed to return to the territory of their traditional food sources.
Journalist Duncan McCue shares four photos of inflated food prices at an Iqaluit grocery store. Via Twitter.
Today, food insecurity in Nunavut is partly due to these communities’ remote geography, which increases the distance that food needs to be shipped and often requires unusual means such as flying in goods. This has resulted in massively inflated prices due to increased shipping costs. In 2016, groceries in Nunavut were sold at up to three times the price of food in the average Canadian grocery store. The government subsidy program Nutrition North Canada has attempted to address this issue through subsidies for certain foods, with little success in combating food insecurity. These high food prices reinforce high poverty rates and food insecurity in Nunavut, with disproportionately large portions of even high-income earners’ salaries going to groceries. Hunting for “country food” is a common alternative to price-inflated groceries. However, this can also be costly when the price of gas, transportation, and equipment is factored in. Additionally, hunting and fishing access is changing as climate change impacts the safety of travel routes as well as contaminants in traditional food sources.

wwf,https://wwf.ca/stories/renewable-energy-in-nunavut/ ,"Renewable energy powers up in Nunavut
Diesel fuel has long been the primary source of energy in Arctic communities. In the harsh environs of the Arctic, diesel fuel is, above all else, reliable – an important characteristic in 24-hour darkness and -40°C temperatures. Unfortunately, this reliability has high logistical, financial and environmental costs, hindering the self-sufficiency and independence of northern and remote communities.
A new WWF-Canada report shows that these sacrifices in the name of reliable heat and light may no longer be necessary.
Our research into habitat-friendly renewable energy from solar and wind shows that there is a cost-effective opportunity to reduce reliance on fossil fuels in Nunavut. This is an important first step to supporting energy stability in the north without risk to marine environments.
To date, there are very few renewable energy projects in Nunavut, and in most cases the wind turbines or solar panels that have been installed are not large enough to make a substantial dent in diesel use. Some reports and newspaper articles have suggested that the incredible cold and harsh conditions make Nunavut an unlikely host for more substantial projects, but this isn’t the case in Alaska, where large-scale and successful projects face similarly severe conditions.
With Alaska’s successes in mind, we are working to catalyze the transition to renewable energy in two Nunavut communities, working with communities, utility companies and governments to demonstrate to all Canadians that habitat-friendly renewable energy is reliable and robust enough to power our future.
In March, Prime Minister Trudeau and President Obama agreed that reducing reliance on diesel fuel in the Arctic was a priority for both Canada and the United States. This was presented as a priority for meeting climate change reduction goals and protecting important marine areas, but it also fits into international Sustainable Development Goal commitments to deliver energy security to people around the world.
Since reliability is a top priority for communities, we need to make sure we’re putting the proper technologies in the proper location. To do that we needed to know a bit more about the communities. How much money were they spending on diesel fuel? How old are their generators? What’s the energy demand of that community? Is it projected to go up or down in the future? Just how much potential is there for solar and wind energy in each? To gather all this information, we worked with the Waterloo Institute for Sustainable Energy (WISE), a world-class clean-energy research institute, and looked at the 13 Nunavut communities that were considered to be the most promising for renewable energy based on wind and solar potential, population and anticipated costs. WISE gathered and analyzed data to predict what the use of renewable energy sources in northern community grids could achieve.
Not only did we find good potential for renewable energy generation in Nunavut communities, but we also found that investment in renewables in many communities made good financial sense. In five of the Nunavut communities studied, an initial investment in renewable energy would be paid for by reduced diesel energy costs.
These results were even more positive than we had hoped at the outset to the project.
It’s clear there are significant opportunities for renewable energy in Nunavut. Our next steps will be to conduct a more in-depth study of the five identified communities, including a workshop this fall, in order to validate the outcomes with communities and stakeholders and collaboratively identify two communities for installing renewable energy. .

This initiative could also help address hunger and extreme weather conditions in Northern Canada.
Canadian scientists are exploring a unique opportunity that might allow them to grow food in outer space thanks to a greenhouse in Gjoa Haven, Nunavut.
Naurvik — which translates to ""growing place"" in Inuinnaqtun — is a greenhouse is made up of two sea containers. Launched last fall by the Arctic Research Foundation and Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, the facility is powered by wind and solar energy and aims to combat food insecurity — an issue that greatly impacts communities in the North.
Nearly 70% of households in Nunavut face moderate to high food insecurity and lack access to healthy and affordable food, according to a report from Action Canada. This figure is six times higher than in the rest of Canada, the report also notes.
Several factors related to the use, availability, quality, and accessibility of food contribute to the issue, according to the Nunavut Food Security Coalition. Climate change and transportation costs — which are 6 to 10 times higher in Nunavut than in other isolated regions of Canada — have added to the problem.
Now, the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) is joining forces with the greenhouse to develop a curriculum dedicated to the study of space-related food production. Scientists and technicians will take part in this program, in collaboration with technical trainers and the Nunavut community.
The project will enable scientists to learn more about food production in a remote environment and under extreme weather conditions. Ultimately, the goal is for these research findings to be applied in outer space.

However, Bamsey noted that the project will remain an exchange-based venture that will benefit all participants, allowing Nunavut residents to expand the greenhouse.
Scientists taking part in the project will share their knowledge and skills in the area of food production, which could prove beneficial to the local community as a whole.
""The government of Canada is going to explore ways to help improve the accessibility of food across the country, including the North, with the aim of taking these lessons learned to help astronauts grow food off the Earth,"" Bamsey added.
The CSA engineer is even optimistic about being able to grow food on the moon in the future.

Fueling a community
More than just the distance, other challenges that come with working in the remote North include the short timeline within which to transport products and perform outdoor work.
Winter in Iqaluit ranges from -22C to -45C, hardly balmy, and accompanying windstorms and snowdrifts are certainly not conducive to regular shipments of goods, including fuel.
To bring fuel to the city, we partnered with the Nunavut Petroleum Corporation in 1996 to form the UQSUQ partnership for the Iqaluit bulk fuel storage facility and pipeline distribution contract.
Snapshot
Date: 1996 - Present
Location: Iqaluit, Nunavut, Canada
Client: Government of Nunavut
Category: Fuel Management & Distribution
a joint venture built on trust and capability
One of our longest joint-venture partnerships in Canada’s North, Uqsuq has been operating and maintaining the Iqaluit bulk fuel storage facility and pipeline distribution system and the delivery of petroleum products, including gasoline, diesel, home heating fuel, AV-gasoline and Jet-A fuel.
The Iqaluit fuel tank facility has a capacity of 79 million litres and not only meets the refueling needs for the airport, a critical refueling stop for international flights crossing the North Atlantic, but also satisfies the needs of the community, with a population of nearly 6,700.
Uqsuq operates out of a locally established office in Iqaluit and has successfully managed all aspects of the sale and distribution of petroleum products for the Government of Nunavut Petroleum Products Division for 20 years. The entire staff is from the local community with high engagement of Inuit employees, demonstrating a strong commitment to building capacity.
Specialized Expertise
With seven four-storey tanks at the bulk fuel storage facility, Uqsuq sells, dispense and deliver the petroleum products to customers in Iqaluit. This includes receiving products, which arrive via ocean-tankers, and managing the annual bulk fuel re-supply.
To support the volume, we maintain a sufficient number of fuel trucks for the delivery of petroleum, including the provision of special equipment that may be required for dispensing aviation products at the Iqaluit airport.
Safety and security
To protect the fuel, storage facility and surrounding communities from the risks involved with large volumes of petroleum products being contained and distributed, we provide emergency response and ongoing security on site. . comforts of home in the high arctic

Canada and the Sustainable Development Goals
The United Nations’ 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which were adopted in 2015 and set goals for 2030, marked another bold leap forward in the fight to address poverty and protect the planet. These goals apply to all countries equally and focus more deeply than the MDGs on the root causes that hinder or prevent sustainable progress. The SDGs are not about halfway measures or Band-Aid solutions, but rather about working directly with the people and communities most affected by global challenges to create social change. We know from past experience that to be most effective, SDG solutions will need to be collaborative, holistic, and contextualized to specific countries, geographies, cultures, and social norms.
As Canada begins to set its own national goals and to contribute more broadly to the global SDGs, the country is at an interesting point in its own development. In the next 20 years, Canada’s demographic makeup will change significantly. By 2036, Statistics Canada, the country’s national statistical agency, forecasts that 30 percent of all residents will have been born outside of the country. Canada’s urban centers will also become larger, younger, and more diverse, with an increasing mix of visible minorities, Indigenous people, and newcomers. These shifts are not isolated but rather reflective of a more globalized world that is changing at a rapid pace. Forces such as economic inequality, environmental degradation, human migration, and political conflict are no longer an ocean away. We are feeling them closer and closer to home. And if these trends continue, as they are likely to, it’s safe to assume that the future will be even more complex than it is today, and that any hope of tackling global challenges connected to the SDGs will in turn require more innovative and community-driven solutions at home.
Fortunately, Canada is in a prime position to lead on such an ambitious agenda. With a diverse and educated population, strong social values, and an abundance of resources, the country can take an important leadership and facilitation role in achieving the SDGs. To do so, we must enable an ecosystem that allows for both large-scale and community-based innovation to flourish.
Large-scale Activities
Within Canada, a number of investments aimed at supporting the SDGs are already under way. Civil society and the federal government are currently working together on the country’s Social Innovation and Social Finance Strategy, with the goal of improving outcomes for vulnerable populations and creating more inclusive and sustainable communities. Community Foundations of Canada (whose CEO coauthored this article), the Canadian Council for International Cooperation, and a dedicated network of partners are leading the creation of an open SDG network to help mobilize public engagement, cross-sector collaboration, knowledge sharing, and institutional action. The Canadian government’s feminist international assistance policy to promote gender equality also will have an impact, through commitments including $150 million over five years to women’s rights organizations in the Global South—the single largest investment of its kind to date from any country. All of these actions indicate positive signs of early leadership and innovation related to achieving the SDGs by the 2030 goal.
The Local Scene
But we know that these investments are likely to yield positive results only if they are complemented by innovative solutions that are locally led, designed, and implemented. One place where these solutions are being employed is in Canada’s Arctic region, through the work of Inspire Nunavut, a social enterprise founded by this article’s other coauthor. Inspire Nunavut has been working closely with Inuit people through a social entrepreneurship training and mentoring program that helps young people create new businesses and take other actions to tackle community problems and improve their lives. The organization is purposeful about integrating Inuit culture into its offerings and has developed an infrastructure that fosters collaboration between various business and mental health support organizations in Nunavut, providing the territory’s entrepreneurs with all-encompassing assistance. This framework has been essential to the success seen so far in the first five communities in which it operates.
Community-based innovation is also abundant in Canada’s biosphere reserve regions, which have long been at the forefront of creating sustainable communities. On Vancouver Island, the Clayoquot Biosphere Trust, one of 191 community foundations across Canada, is promoting sustainable development by mapping local data and community knowledge to SDG targets through its annual “Vital Signs” report. In doing so, the Trust is able to benchmark progress against a set of global targets and better understand the community’s contribution to an international agenda.
These kinds of community-based innovations are reflective of a more contextualized approach to sustainability—one in which civil society has an important role to play alongside government and the private sector.
Success May Not Be So Far Away
The stakes for the planet have never been higher, and the SDGs rightly recognize that ending poverty and ensuring global prosperity must go hand in hand with strategies that build sustainable communities. Although global progress so far has been anything but uniform, and far from complete, the advancements that we as an international community have made in less than a generation suggest that achieving the moonshot goals of poverty eradication and global sustainability may not be as far away as they once were.
As we continue to take on global challenges at the local level, Canada has so much to contribute. With the right investments and support to help the engines of social enterprise and social innovation flourish, Canada can continue to demonstrate its leadership on the global stage—creating a fertile environment for change and a future that is better and brighter for all. .

Food sovereignty in the Arctic is deeply tied to an ethic of subsistence, of being able to harvest fresh food from the immediate environment year-round [ 1
, 2
]. The Inuit have provided for themselves through hard work and ingenuity for centuries directly from the land and sea with knowledge passed down to them through generations [ 3
, 4
]. Inuit take pride in being self-reliant and resilient [ 2
]. Subsistence is not just a socioeconomic system, but it also holds a deep cultural and spiritual tie that provides a source for recreation, connection, therapy, beauty, and knowledge and hence is central to the physical as well as social, cultural, and spiritual wellbeing of Inuit communities [ 3
, 4
, 5
]. Subsistence is a way of life that binds Inuit to the natural world.
While the practice of subsistence has suffered many setbacks by colonization, assimilation, and globalization over the years, it has carried through to this day to face yet another challenge of an environment that is changing too fast [ 3
, 6
]. Climate change has brought a sharp increase in surface temperatures in the Arctic. Parts of the Arctic are warming twice as fast as the global average [ 7
, 8
, 9
], with the most dramatic changes occurring in the winter seasons [ 9
]. As a result, the sea ice that the Inuit travel over and where they hunt has generally become thinner, recedes faster in the spring, and arrives later in the fall [ 10
]. Sea ice change also affects the availability of the marine mammals and fish that Inuit hunt and rely on as staples of their traditional diets [ 11
, 12
].
Sea ice change is particularly consequential for the Arctic ecosystem because it affects all levels of the Arctic food web, from primary producers such as phytoplankton to higher predators such as polar bears [ 8
, 12
, 13
]. While some species may benefit from an increasingly ice-free Arctic (e.g., seasonally migrant cetaceans), declines have been observed in marine mammals (ring-necked seals) and in terrestrial species (caribou) [ 11
, 13
, 14
]. There are numerous reports of the direct impacts of climate change on traditional food availability in Arctic regions. Hunters and elders in Igloolik (Nunavut) describe a situation of declining availability of walrus, caribou, and seal [ 15
]. Fort McKay in Yukon is seeing considerable changes in food availability due to climate change [ 16
]. Widespread changes in habitats, migration patterns, and distribution of species have also been noted [ 17
, 18
, 19
]. Further, pathogens and diseases in wildlife are an increasing threat in the warming Arctic [ 20
, 21
, 22
, 23
, 24
, 25
].
In addition to impacts on food availability, climate change affects the network of activities related to the practice of subsistence—hunting, trapping, gathering, processing, storing, distributing, and consuming wild foods. Many Arctic communities are remote and not connected to the roads and other distribution systems and many hunters travel considerable distance on snowmobiles for harvesting. Sea ice or rivers often serve as road networks that Inuit’s use for travel, these activities especially become more risky as the climate warms. For instance, hunters in several Arctic communities report greater hazards and risks as a result of extreme and unpredictable weather, shifts in freeze and melt cycles, thinner ice, and other climate-related changes [ 26
, 27
, 28
, 29
, 30
, 31
, 32
, 33
]. Adaptations to these changes are affected by existing social, cultural, and economic factors such as poverty, changing social practices, and wage employment. In Iqaluit (Nunavut), Statham and colleagues [ 33
] found that sea ice freeze-up occurred 59 days later, and temperatures were 4.9 degrees (C) higher than average in the winter of 2010–2011 impacting the traditional food system. They found that participants’ ability to access traditional food supply was compromised due to climate-related stressors as well as socio-economic and cultural factors such as income, participation in sharing networks, and hunting experience. Similarly, in Igloolik, Ford [ 27
] showed that climatic conditions overwhelmed the adaptive capacity of many community members, particularly those who were dependent on traditional foods and had limited access to financial resources. In both studies, the authors report increased consumption of non-nutritious processed foods due to constraints on the traditional food supply; other responses included skipping meals, eating less, and asking friends and relatives for food.
Loss of indigenous food sovereignty due to climate change has become a topic of great concern to Arctic residents. Much of the food security and climate change literature has focused on impacts in the tropics, where the majority of the food security problems currently exist. This paper examines food security in a relatively understudied region—In the Arctic which is likely to experience the most severe climatic changes in the 21st century [ 29
, 34
]. In an already food insecure region, climate change threatens access to healthy subsistence resources and overall food sovereignty. This research examines stressors and linkages between recent environmental changes and impacts on food sovereignty and health in two Inuit communities of Kugluktuk and Cambridge Bay in western Nunavut. We argue that climate change threatens food sovereignty and increases structural inequities in the Arctic. We identify that decolonial practices and increased transfer of intergenerational knowledge are essential to increase food sovereignty in the Arctic.
Food Sovereignty in the Arctic: A Theoretical Overview
The Inuit Circumpolar Council of Alaska (ICC-Alaska) defines food sovereignty as “the right of [all] Inuit to define their own hunting, gathering, fishing, land and water policies. The right to define what is sustainable and socially, economically, and culturally appropriate for the distribution of food and to maintain ecological health. The right to obtain and maintain practices that ensure access to tools needed to obtain, process, store and consume traditional foods” [ 2
, 4
]. To the Inuit there is an “undeniable connection between food sovereignty and food security. Food sovereignty in the north is necessary to avoid food insecurity.
Food security is defined by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) as “a situation that exists when people, at all times, have physical, social and economic access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life” [ 35
, 36
]. The FAO identifies the pillars of food security as availability, access, utilization, and stability [ 37
]. A situation of food insecurity exists when one or more of those “pillars” is lacking or destabilized. However, such a concept of food security is quite focused on a reformist ideology that focuses on the development of niche markets, agricultural subsidies, and market-led neoliberalist reform to serve the needs of fulfilling food security. Studies on food security largely measure the capability to purchase food (e.g., [ 38
]), or use methodologies adapted from other countries (e.g., [ 39
]). While these measures do capture certain aspects of food insecurity (access to food, skipped meals, food choices, etc.), these assessments do not represent a situated understanding of food insecurity within the Inuit socio-cultural and historical context.
Food security guidelines as defined by FAO fall short in addressing the needs of indigenous communities that rely far more on subsistence to achieve food security than through the market-led reforms. The framework outlined by the ICC underlines a view that at the core of food insecurity in the Arctic is the disruption of indigenous food systems, loss of self-reliance, and sustainability, underscoring the fundamental importance of decision-making power, autonomy, and justice as part of Inuit food security. Other studies affirm the importance of self-determination and cultural considerations (e.g., Inuit culture, self-reliance food preferences), and social or ethical considerations of sustainability, and social justice (scarcity, allocation, rights to land, and decision-making power) [ 40
, 41
, 42
].
By many measures, food insecurity is widespread among Inuit families across Canada, particularly in Nunavut compared to the other Territories of Canada—Northwest Territories and Yukon. Canada’s 2016 Food Report Card notes Nunavut to be the most food insecure province in Canada, where one in four people were food insecure; notably, indigenous people in Nunavut were more than twice as likely to be food insecure compared to the indigenous people from Northwest Territories or Yukon [ 43
]. These rates are in stark contrast to the 9% food insecurity and 3% severe food insecurity as a whole in Canada in the national surveys [ 44
]. A study of Inuit in Arctic territories in Canada found that 69–70% of Nunavut residents were food insecure and reported skipped meals and days gone hungry [ 45
, 46
].
A study conducted in Kugaaruk, Nunavut, showed that five out of six households were food insecure due to the inability to buy adequate amounts of food; almost half the families in the community were “extremely concerned” about having enough food to feed their family [ 40
]. The “country food” (wild-harvested local food) consumption in this community was only 10% of energy intake. In a survey of 388 Inuit preschoolers in Nunavut, Egeland et al. [ 38
] found that nearly 70% of those children were food insecure. Huet et al. [ 39
] found that food insecurity among roughly 900 households in Iqaluit, Nunavut, was more common in households with children (33%) than those without children (23%), and also among households that consumed more frozen meat and fish compared to those that consumed more fresh foods. Widespread food insecurity in Nunavut has been further documented by other researchers [ 46
, 47
, 48
, 49
, 50
, 51
]. Studies have noted lower food insecurity in households that include country food in their diet, which has been shown to reinforce social bonds and cultural identity [ 15
, 52
, 53
, 54
, 55
, 56
, 57
, 58
]. Collings et al. [ 59
] attribute a declining consumption of country foods to rapid social change, changing economic conditions as well as climate change.
The 2007 Nyéléni International Forum defined food sovereignty as “the right of peoples to healthy and culturally appropriate food produced through ecologically sound and culturally appropriate methods, and their right to define their own food and agricultural systems” [ 60
]. This ideology of food sovereignty puts the aspirations and needs of those who produce, distribute, and consume food at the heart of food systems and policies rather than the demands of markets and corporations. It focuses on parity, redistributive land reform, regional food systems, and democratization of food systems by decidedly dismantling unjust corporate agrifoods monopoly of food systems [ 42
]. The food justice movement makes visible the structural barriers communities of color face to access local, healthy, and nutritious foods due to institutional racism and economic inequality [ 61
, 62
]. It utilizes a progressive empowerment framework that advocates for rights to food, increased safety nets and investments in underserved communities, and community benefit packages for production, land, and food access [ 63
]. In addition, for the Inuit, recognition justice and knowledge justice—Recognition of Inuit sociocultural identities and the protection of their practices, capabilities, and their knowledge systems—Is central to exercising food sovereignty. The ICC-Alaska reflects this emphasis on distribution, autonomy, and decision-making power in its food security “dimensions” by specifically identifying “Inuit culture, decision-making power and management, and health and wellness” as vital aspects of food security, alongside more conventional components of availability, stability, and accessibility [ 2
, 35
].
This research uses the ICC dimensions of food sovereignty and food security [ 2
, 4
]: Inuit culture, decision-making power and management, availability, accessibility, stability, and health and wellness to understand impacts from climate change on food sovereignty and health of people in Kugluktuk and Cambridge Bay in Nunavut.
3. Results
We use the ICC-Alaska Food Security dimensions to organize our observations of food security-related issues into six categories: (1) changing Inuit culture, (e.g., loss of cultural capabilities and self-reliance); (2) changes in local availability of food; (3) lack of direct, financial, and familial access to country foods; (4) agency and decision making power regarding food systems; (5) concerns over long-term stability and sustainability of the food systems; and (6) impacts on health and wellbeing. We cite excerpts from our interviews as well as other published literature sources to illustrate these changes in the two communities. A summary of major themes noted in each category is presented in Table 1
.
3.1. Changing Inuit Culture, Loss of Cultural Capabilities and Self-Reliance
Food security issues cannot be contemplated apart from a recognition of the unique historical, political, and socioecological context of Inuit culture [ 71
]. Traditionally, Inuit led a nomadic subsistence way of life, sourcing food from their immediate environment across vast areas of the Arctic land, ocean, and “icescape”—A concept analogous to landscape but specific to ice-bound regions of the North [ 72
]. Over the years, the Inuit bond with land and wildlife was weakened due to colonial encroachment, policing, restrictive land management, forced assimilation, and residential school education. These new systems of settler colonialism systematically and deliberately disrupted the generational transfer of traditional knowledge [ 73
].
These major cultural shifts were part of a not too distant memory for many of the participants. Among the elders interviewed in Kugluktuk, only three were born in Kugluktuk; four participants moved there when they were young, and one participant recalled growing up a nomad living in “little communities” in the region. Among Cambridge Bay participants, three grew up there, three moved from Peary River, and two others moved to Cambridge Bay from other neighboring places. The remaining participants did not disclose their background information. Some discussed moving to Cambridge Bay because the outpost camp or the trade center in their community closed. One of the elders in this study, moved to Cambridge Bay from Peary River in 1961 because his father was sick with tuberculosis and had to be close to a nursing station. Another elder, John, used to trap years ago until Hudson Bay Company personnel told him that foxes were not going to be worth much anymore, and he found a job at the DEW line site in town in the 1960s. He has also worked briefly in mining, which he found was more lucrative. Sammy from Cambridge Bay shared he still misses living out in the land: “We are used to this way of life and feel [we] are stuck here, we’re stuck here, having to be in one place.”
Food was a central theme in recollections of these exchanges. Christine of Kugluktuk describes how eating “southern” food was a part of the residential school experience, as notable as learning English: “Growing up, I would have caribou blood for juice, all these traditional foods. Cooked intestines and whatnot. I was taught syllabics in my language and everything and then going to school, I learned a whole different story, a whole different thing. I had to learn 1-2-3, ABCs. Plus, I learned how to have pizza and all these kinds of food, and speak this English language.” Several other participants described how residential schools separated them from their families and from learning the skills of subsistence hunting and survival and being able to learn and practice these skills only during their summer trips home.
Despite the difficulties people have faced in learning and practicing traditional ways of living, participants in both communities said that they relied heavily on the land and strongly preferred traditional foods. Hunting expeditions have now evolved and involve a blend of traditional practices combined with modern technologies like GPS, snowmobiles, motorboats, high-powered rifles, fuel, and other equipment [ 32
, 74
]. While this modern equipment increases access to the land, it is also expensive to purchase and maintain. This results in a dynamic tension between wage employment and hunting, as involvement in the wage economy restricts the amount of time available for hunting and harvesting, but it provides the necessary capital for outfitting hunting expeditions. This tension is summarized well by Nuttall [ 74
]: “The reality for most Nunavummiut is that the best return for one dollar comes from hunting, but without a dollar, hunting is not possible.” These pressures on the traditional food system were concerning to many participants, who noted that young people were growing up with a focus on jobs and money and new technology, not on hunting or learning from their elders. Participants in both communities worry that skills and traditional knowledge may not be passed on to the young generation.
For households that lack an active hunter, participation in the food sharing network is one way that the household may still access country food [ 59
]. This system of sharing food, ningiqtuq
, is found throughout Inuit communities in Nunavut [ 57
]. This system involves a complex web of hierarchies and traditions for sharing food harvested from hunting. This sharing may be among family or “restricted extended family” or it may take place in community-wide sharing in the form of communal meals or radio announcements to share a harvest with someone in need [ 74
]. Among participants in Kugluktuk in particular, there was a concern that sharing has decreased. A decline in hunting among elders, and a reported lack of interest in traditional ways among youth, are also reported and discussed in the following sections.
3.2. Changes in Local Availability of Food
In this research, we use “availability” to represent the general supply side of food security, both in terms of the amounts of basic resources such as wildlife available as well as production and procurement (e.g., hunting or fishing). In both communities, hunting and fishing supply a significant portion of the community’s food intake. According to government reports, “country foods” comprise about two-thirds of the dietary intake (by weight) in both towns: caribou alone supplies 40%, fishing accounts for an additional 13–15%, with muskox, marine mammals, and birds contributing an additional 8–10% of all dietary intake [ 75
]. Imported and local foods are also available for purchase at stores and co-ops. Two major changes in availability that were reported by the community members in both communities are changes in wildlife (e.g., migration patterns, population size, species), and changes in harvesting (e.g., number of active hunters in the community).
In both communities, caribou was the most frequently discussed wildlife species. In Kugluktuk, there was widespread agreement that caribou were changing their migration routes and were further away from the town than before. In Kugluktuk, a later freeze-up of the Northwest Passage was consistently described as the reason why caribou had moved farther away: “They would be coming from Victoria Island and they don’t do that anymore. Because of the late freezing, I think they go by more east, towards Cambridge Bay and somewhere around Bathurst area maybe.” A decline in precipitation (rain and snow) and subsequent lack of plant growth was considered as another reason caribou may be declining: “If we have lots of snow, lots of rain, we have lots of plants for the animals. But we don’t get very much snow, we don’t get very much rain. The creeks, the river, anywhere you have the lakes. Most of them are drying out too… That’s why it’s getting harder for people to hunt caribou.” In total, changes in weather and sea ice were mentioned in seven interviews (half of the interviewees) in Kugluktuk in connection with declining caribou stocks.
While several participants in Cambridge Bay also commented on the decreasing abundance and proximity of caribou, two interviewees seemed not too worried about the caribou stocks in Cambridge Bay. Another participant clarified that the later freeze-up (widely noted among respondents in both communities: see [ 32
]) had not affected their caribou supply as much, because the caribou wait on Victoria Island for the Passage to freeze before heading south for the winter—Providing Cambridge Bay with access to caribou no matter the timing of the freeze. However, other interviewees from Cambridge Bay described how caribou were declining in general in the past few years, so larger population-level effects may become an issue for those in Cambridge Bay. Some participants in Cambridge Bay noted that the caribou were also thinner than usual; others described caribou drowning from trying to cross when the ice was not yet thick enough. Development in Cambridge Bay, according to two participants, has pushed wildlife away from the town. Some acknowledged this as a tradeoff: Ned, for instance, notes that seals and game animals used to come close to the town, but now they stay away. He concludes “We have to get food in our stores and stuff.”
Fish stocks were also a common concern among participants from both communities. In Kugluktuk, several interviewees mentioned an alarming decline in Arctic char. Participants in both communities reported a recent increase in the abundance of whitefish.
Participation in hunting was another major topic discussed in the interviews—especially among participants in Kugluktuk. While one interviewee in Cambridge Bay was said to go hunting less as he was getting older (according to his wife), in Kugluktuk, four interviewees mentioned that the older, more experienced hunters were going out less. Bob from Kugluktuk, for instance, notes that “as an elder, there’s not very many of us that stay out on the land for a time now… we’ve gotten older, I’m having some health problems and I can’t get out on the land very much anymore.”
Finally, in over half of the interviews in Kugluktuk, participants expressed concern or frustration that youth were not as interested in hunting. As one participant, Betty, from Kugluktuk describes, fewer people hunting means less food available to share with the community: “Yup, they’re going to the mines, getting jobs. There used to be lots of hunters, I think there’s less hunters now… we depend on people to get the meat and everything. If we can’t get it or if they can’t give it to us, we have to buy the meat. And it gets harder and harder. Like we don’t have jobs for where we get the money to buy meat.”
Lastly, Bob from Kugluktuk expressed concern about the strains of population increase on food availability: “Our basic ingredients, like the fresh fruits, our vegetables, animals, aren’t keeping up with the population of people. I’ve noticed that lately. As a child I’ve known Kugluktuk to have a population of 500 maybe, compared to today, there’s 1500 people. And that makes a huge difference.”
3.3. Lack of Direct, Financial, and Familial Access to Country Foods
We use the accessibility category to describe issues and obstacles related to obtaining food, either in hunting, sharing, or purchasing food. Food access was discussed in these interviews primarily in relation to ability to participate in hunting, barriers to hunting safely or successfully, as well as the participation in distribution networks (e.g., social sharing); monetization of food and ability to afford food was another common theme in the interviews. There was general agreement that harvesting and accessing country food is very dependent on money and getting prohibitively expensive for some, financial hardship limits access to all foods, both country foods and store-bought.
However, it was clear to many participants that environmental changes have made accessing country foods more challenging in recent years. A later fall freeze-up of Queen Maud Gulf and Coronation Gulf (both are part of the southern route of the Northwest Passage) was mentioned by nearly all participants in both towns as delaying access to hunting grounds. In Kugluktuk, lack of snow was an additional concern for many participants, since less snow meant rougher travel in the winter, and extra time and expense navigating around rough patches and repairing damaged machines. Accidents have become more frequent due to thinner ice, shallow snow patches, and other navigational difficulties during storms (also discussed in [ 32
]). An increase in shipping and icebreaking was mentioned in connection with both wildlife disruption and hunting grounds access. One participant in Cambridge Bay recounted a story of a hunter being stranded for several days after an icebreaker cut off his ice route back to town. Other environmental changes that presented challenges to navigation are given in Figure 1
and discussed in more detail in Panikkar et al. [ 32
].
Less sharing and the monetization of country food was a common concern, especially among participants in Kugluktuk. In a group interview there, participants discussed how people were buying and selling country food instead of sharing: “With all prices of groceries going up, it used to be easy to access all the country food. But it’s getting tougher to get… they’re not sharing no more.” Another Kugluktuk participant noted “people nowadays are selling country food like crazy. They’re selling it to their relatives or other people. They’ll sell it to maybe HTO or somewhere else, and they’ll tell their own: ‘Oh, go get your meat from there, I just bought some.’” Betty, also from Kugluktuk, expressed dismay at the idea of having to buy country foods from her own relatives: “A long time ago, even though we did have jobs, everybody used to help each other. But now we have to buy everything from one person or another person to get by. Even with anything that you really need… any groceries, anything you cook, you have to buy it now from people sometimes, even your own relatives. I have lots of relatives too, they get lots of meat, they get lots of caribou or anything. It’s really, really, really hard. You have to ask. If they can’t give it to you, might have to buy it… when you don’t have a job, you’re on old-age pension, social assistance, the meat and the food, they’re really… the prices are so high! Some people have to go to ask another person, ‘Can you buy this for me?’” A burdensome cost of living and food was reiterated by several Kulguktuk participants.
3.4. Agency and Decision-Making Power over Food Systems
Some participants had a grim view of their agency over the food systems due to heavy reliance on the wage economy, inability to stop impacts of climate change, and a sense of powerlessness regarding the influx of development and industry.
For Ned from Cambridge Bay, the entrenchment of money and government programs in the food system was especially difficult to accept: “I’m just kind of lost right now for words. I seen it too long, and I don’t know how to explain in a right way, to make people understand that life is changing, as an Inuk. We don’t have to change it, but it’s changing—we have no choice. We have to live off the government. We have to rely on them if [people are] not very oriented with our land… so food’s been kind of scarce. People love [the] food here and they still do, but you have to go further, and it costs money to go out there. Everything, it’s all money.” In Ned’s assessment, reliance on government and money is connected also with the loss of traditional knowledge.
While some shared Ned’s sentiment of being unable to stop the changes that are affecting the Inuit lifestyle, others described their strategies for adapting. Some participants noted that honing the cultural capability of traditional knowledge and skills of subsistence harvesting is key to resilience, to change, and in maintaining autonomy over food systems. Bob from Kugluktuk was especially wary of placing trust in the cash economy and southern foods: “Some of us try hard as we can to teach our young people to be out on the land, but the majority of the community, especially in my age group, they’ve never been trained out on the land anymore, and they’re the ones that are really having a hard time with country foods or… they’re always depending on jobs. Jobs are not forever. Jobs are only as long as the project, the life of the project. Might be a couple years, 20 years, or even my life—my life is not forever. That’s what we’re trying to teach young people all right, we want to go back out on the land as much as we can, but we keep telling them, you can’t depend on feeding yourself from the southern parts of Canada.” In a group interview in Kugluktuk, several participants said that they adapted to changes by changing their hunting routes, just like other mammals change their migrations.
3.5. Stability and Sustainability of Food Systems
A sustained harvest of traditional foods depends on hunters and wildlife: participants in this study were concerned about the long-term sustainability of both aspects of the traditional food system. The declining availability of many important fish and game species (discussed in 3.1) made some, like Betty from Kugluktuk, worried that there will not be much left to hunt: “…some years we probably will not even be seeing caribou, because of the climate change. And if there’s no caribou and muskox and other things, it’s gonna be hard for everybody.” Others were worried that besides the availability of animals, the current generation will not have the knowledge and skills to safely hunt. Participants in both towns described youth as increasingly likely to take risks without adequate preparation. Lenny from Kugluktuk shares: “My main concern is that none of them will go out hunting anymore. And they don’t know the sea ice conditions. They don’t know how to travel on the ice or on the ocean. They don’t know how to read the weather… kids these days are gearing more to staying in town and going out just for day trips. But those day trips could be dangerous for them because they don’t know what the hell they’re doing anymore.” Other participants shared accounts of young people getting lost or even dying from going out onto the land unprepared.
In addition to concerns about availability, several participants commented on issues with the quality of country foods. In Kugluktuk, Bob mentioned a decrease in quality of char and meat: “We’re noticing that the Arctic char isn’t really Arctic char anymore. It tastes more mushier or something. And the meat is a whole lot different from what it used to be. Although there’s still a few places where you can get that pristineness in the meat content, where the glaciers are.” Disease also affects meat quality. Participants in two interviews in Cambridge Bay and one in Kugluktuk mentioned an increase in diseased muskox. Both Jim and Ned from Cambridge Bay describe the toll of disease on muskox: “I used to do a lot of muskox harvesting. And there were always muskox around. But we haven’t been doing any harvest lately because they’re so far away now. And they’re getting some kind of disease that kind of chase everybody away”; “Either way, north, west, or east. We’ll see very few now… sometimes I look out there and I’ll see muskox, like about eight, nine years ago. Now I can’t even see anything there. But when I travel to Victoria Island to go fishing on the lake, I’m running into more dead muskox.” These examples mirror other observations of an increase in parasitic diseases in animals [ 25
].
Some interviewees expressed concerns about the impacts on wildlife due to contaminants such as mercury. Three participants from Kugluktuk specifically described mining as a cause for disrupting wildlife or changing the productivity of the land. For instance, one describes working for a company that left permanent impacts: “I’ve worked with quite a few companies, and there’s one or two companies that weren’t, how would you say it, the cleanest, but they weren’t the worst… they did the best they could to maintain that hazard… And I was fortunate enough to be there just to try and keep it contained. But hazards find ways to leave, to spread. That’s what I think of ‘hazard,’ it spreads quickly. And it devastates our economy—huge! You can see it. Like where there’s been a mining camp, you can tell, nothing’s there, just dead. Nothing at all, just like a drought happened.” Participants from both communities mentioned development, noise, and dust from the mining operations, as a reason that animals were moving farther away.
The overall sustainability and stability of country foods, therefore, depends on more than just maintaining availability: it also depends on maintaining hunting traditions, equipping the younger generation with adequate skills, and mitigating impacts from contamination, development, and disease.
3.6. Health and Wellbeing
Wellbeing was discussed both in terms of individual health and that of the land. Hunting is one of the primary ways that community members spend extended time on the land, which itself was described as healing. For instance, Dennis from Kugluktuk says: “I think… when you go out on land, it makes you feel so good inside. You stay in the community, you don’t have jobs, you get more stressed out. It gets harder… They get more stressed out without going out on the land because you heal out there.” Similarly, Ned from Cambridge Bay describes how being on the land is key to his personal wellbeing: “Just go out there and—if the air is good, and you breathe it, that’s when it hit you. You go— [takes deep breaths]—Then you finally calm down. It’s nicer out here, nice and quiet. That’s the only way we’re gonna survive, is breathe. Don’t hold anything back, let it out.”
Changing food preferences were also described as a threat to health. Dan, from Cambridge Bay, had an unfavorable opinion of imported foods: “That was our diet many years ago, that’s all we eat, native food. I would say on the land, animals in the ocean, they are fresh, the way I see. It’s all fresh. Not food from down south.” Beverly from Kugluktuk says that disease and sickness are connected to less frequent traditional food consumption: “Getting no more country food. That’s why people getting sick all the time, from northern store, co-op store—no good.” Christine, also from Kugluktuk, noted an increase in obesity in children and youth: “You see more kids today, more obese, more overweight.” In an aboriginal people’s survey on Inuit health, 26% of Inuit surveyed were reported as obese compared to 16% for non-aboriginal people [ 76
, 77
]. In this study, those who were obese also had poor health and strong family ties were associated with excellent or very good health. Many studies have indicated the health and nutritional benefits of traditional food sources compared to the imported foods available for purchase in Arctic communities [ 78
, 79
], suggesting that reliance on imported foods can have direct negative impacts in terms of poorer health outcomes [ 80
].
Mental health was frequently discussed in connection to wellbeing. Participants in Kugluktuk discussed substance abuse and suicide, noting the huge toll both have taken on the community. Some relayed that poverty and lack of jobs as the major cause of alcoholism and drug use. An increase in substance abuse also impairs the traditional culture of subsistence as those dependent are incapable of carrying out these traditions. Betty from Kugluktuk noted that “we didn’t have very many people to work in social services, like mental health workers. Now it’s a good start, since beginning of the year. I think we have three people. We’re getting more help, and sending people out. A lot of people died or committed suicide through the years.”
Rates of drinking and smoking are in general already much higher in the Inuit population compared to the non-aboriginal people, all of which also increases the risks of chronic diseases [ 81
]. Only 44% of the Canadian Inuit have access to a doctor and most Inuit communities only have a nursing station, though these communities are severely socially and physically stressed [ 81
].
As discussed in previous sections, an increase in hazards and accidents has been observed in both communities, in particular related to being unprepared and unskilled in survival techniques [ 32
].
4. Conclusions and Discussion
Climate change makes the environment more variable and triggers unpredictable changes in bodies, spaces, and ecologies—and on the systems, functions, and processes that influence them. This research highlights that climate change threatens resource availability but also cultural capability, by making subsistence a riskier practice. Inuit who have traditionally been adept in reading the environment and surviving on the land are finding these skills both in decline and also less reliable than before in an increasingly unpredictable environment [ 32
]. While participants in this study felt that maintaining traditional skills was essential to long-term survival, climate change challenges these coping and adaptive capabilities. These risks are further exacerbated by socio-cultural changes that have disrupted the generational transfer of knowledge, as well as increases in disease and contamination that threaten the long-term viability of traditional food sources. Overall, these combined impacts stand to undermine the food sovereignty of these communities. Climate-mediated food insecurity hence can be seen as a complex syndrome of multiple causes: ecological injury, loss of natural resources, and cultural injury.
While there were many concerns shared by both communities, participants in Kugluktuk brought up a number of concerns that were not reflected among interviews in Cambridge Bay. While many participants from both towns commented on a declining availability of caribou in general, those in Kugluktuk were especially concerned about the impact of freeze timing on caribou availability, where hunters in Cambridge Bay suggested that they were buffered from this impact by their location on Victoria Island (north of the Passage); lack of snow was also making hunting harder in Kugluktuk, a change not noted in Cambridge Bay. A decline in sharing networks, increased difficulty affording food, and having to buy food from family members were all noted in Kugluktuk only; participants in Cambridge Bay offered more general reflections about the entrenchment of money in the Inuit way of life and rising costs but did not describe similar hardships as those in Kugluktuk. Kugluktuk participants were also especially worried about the impacts of substance abuse and suicide on youth and specifically mentioned imported foods as a cause for sickness. Not all interviewees were asked the exact same questions in interviews, and the survey participants do not represent a comprehensive survey of these towns, so this observation does not necessarily prove that these issues only exist in Kugluktuk. However, as these observations were consistently raised by Kugluktuk participants, and since similar topics and questions were covered in Cambridge Bay, we believe there is cause to believe that Kugluktuk residents are facing a higher burden of climate-related food insecurity than those in Cambridge Bay. These results concur with other studies which have shown a decrease or change in the availability of wildlife in the Arctic [ 11
, 13
, 14
, 15
, 16
, 17
, 18
, 19
]; the impacts on subsistence practices due to climatic change [ 4
, 5
, 33
] and the adverse impacts to subsistence and country foods from climate change, and developmental pressures [ 82
].
The differential experiences in Cambridge Bay and Kugluktuk are also supported by the difference in socio-demographic makeup of the two hamlets. The latest census data of the National Household Survey [ 83
, 84
] shows that Inuit in Cambridge Bay had a higher employment rate (60%) and lower unemployment rate (14%) compared to Kugluktuk which has an employment rate of 36% and an unemployment rate of 28% respectively). Additionally, the Community Well-Being (CWB) Index shows that Cambridge Bay ranks higher than Kugluktuk in all categories, such as income, education, housing, labor force activity, and overall CWB [ 85
]. Recent research on Inuit participation in wage and land-based economies in Inuit Nunangat show that Nunavut had higher participation in land-based activities compared to Nunavik, and Inuvialuit [ 85
]. A total of 74% of men and 59% of women in Nunavut participated in hunting, fishing, or trapping and 46% of women were engaged in gathering plants compared to 30% of men but these land-based activities were heavily influenced by the income and labor status of the people. Inuit not in the labor force were less likely and those with higher income were more likely to participate in land-based activities [ 83
, 86
, 87
, 88
]. These studies show that those involved in the wage economy are more able to avail mechanisms and technology to undertake subsistence and practice it safely.
The frequent descriptions of food insecurity and economic hardship in connection with climate change among interviewees in Kugluktuk suggest that climate pressures could be exacerbating certain underlying structural inequities in these two communities. With the decreasing availability and access to country foods, both communities could be described as “food swamps”—areas where only unhealthy foods are readily available [ 89
]. Additionally, healthier options of fruits and vegetables are available at some stores but are often exorbitantly expensive, creating “food mirages” [ 90
] and leaving people to buy increasingly poor-quality packaged foods. Opting for cheaper food sources also brings new risks, as many chronic health challenges are connected to these non-nutritious foods [ 91
]. Our interviews confirm the centrality of traditional foods for Inuit health and wellbeing.
The intersecting character of climate change, colonial power relations, and participating in a capitalistic globalized economy compounds the challenges of mediating cultural and relational responsibilities towards land. These changes together increase reliance on imported food regimes that fashions everyday cognitive and social behaviors away from local cultural norms and practices. Further, lack of agency, self-determination, and sovereignty keeps people in a disempowering cycle that perpetuates structural inequities.
While climate change makes subsistence riskier, approaches to address climate change alone are insufficient to reverse and prevent future threats to Inuit communities in the short-term. Declining local food sources such as caribou and Arctic char also threatens Inuit communities. Measures to protect the Arctic wildlife, addressing developmental pressures and new sources of pollution, safeguarding subsistence practices, intergenerational transfer of cultural capabilities, and enhancing human-nature reciprocity are important to ensure food sovereignty and adaptation in the Arctic in the long run. Traditional skills in navigation, survival, hunting, trapping, fishing, and gathering food and medicine are a means of resilience and survival. Inuit have used these skills to stay resilient in an environment where biological productivity is low, resources are patchy, and availability is unpredictable. Their unique ways of observing—constant monitoring for unusual signs and signals, intimate knowledge of the landscape, deep understanding of natural processes—give them a great deal of personal autonomy and sovereignty as well as competence even under conditions of resource unpredictability [ 4
, 92
]. To observe and adapt to change is one of the most valued and respected skills among Inuit, it denotes alignment with the world and a refinement of the spirit [ 93
]. While Inuit might be able to stay resilient and adaptive to the onslaught of climate change it is still morally, ethically, and legally problematic to inflict ecological injury and merely exacerbate unjust and exploitative relations. Hence, southern nations need to step up to ensure that those who cause harm help to restore balance and wellbeing [ 93
].
Inuit and Canadian governments have an enormous historic responsibility to protect local cultural traditions and capabilities and reject policies that continue to be detrimental to Inuit long-term security, health, safety, and well-being. Firstly, further studies are required to understand the decline in resource availability (e.g., caribou and Arctic char) in these communities and how climate change is impacting local biodiversity. Many HTOs participate in biomonitoring programs to engage in responsible harvesting, these programs provide valuable service to the communities and need to be better supported and protected. Secondly, programs that encourage local adaptive capabilities and enhancing the intergenerational knowledge transfer on subsistence practices to the youth were for the most part seen favorably by participants in this study. Youth perspectives are important to bridge the inter-generational gap between elders and younger members of the Inuit communities. Future studies should examine why the youth are less engaged or able to participate in or learn about traditional ways of life (including hunting, learning more comprehensive outdoor and survival skills, or less involved in supporting extended family members or sharing networks). Lastly, a situated understanding of how climate change is impacting the local communities is required in order to address the resilience and adaptation of these communities. Empowerment of communities, by means of better job training, job opportunities, social services including basic health and mental health services are required and implementing decolonizing strategies that retain local knowledge is important to trigger unique mechanisms of coping, problem-solving, and adaptation as climate change accelerates. In this study, we argue that ecological injury, environmental injustices, cultural injury, and food insecurity can be prevented by contesting national policies and programs that impinge on Inuit sovereignty, self-determination, and Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit or knowledge. .

un,https://www.un.org/en/chronicle/article/health-effects-global-warming-developing-countries-are-most-vulnerable ,"The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) states that the increase in global atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) is primarily due to fossil fuel use and, in a smaller but still significant level, to land-use change.
An Inconvenient Truth, a documentary by former United States Vice-President Al Gore, has also drawn public attention to the critical issue of global warming and how the burning of fossil fuels has increased the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere. Global warming can result in many serious alterations to the environment, eventually impacting human health. It can also cause a rise in sea level, leading to the loss of coastal land, a change in precipitation patterns, increased risks of droughts and floods, and threats to biodiversity. The effects are already evident in areas like Nunavut, Canada, where Inuit hunters are facing survival challenges due to the thinning of the ice. Explorer Will Steger gives an account of hunters in the Baffin Island, who are faced with the dilemma of unsafe hunting due to ice loss, risking their lives to get in contact with sea animals.
Besides the visible effects on people's livelihoods, global warming is predicted to have a strong and adverse impact on human health. The populations of countries that have contributed the least to global warming are the most vulnerable to death and diseases brought about by higher temperatures. The coastlines along the Pacific Ocean and the Indian Ocean and in sub-Saharan Africa will be at higher risk of enduring the health effects of climate change.
The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that climate change is responsible for at least 150,000 deaths per year, a number that is expected to double by 2030. The effects of global warming will cause dire health consequences:
Infectious diseases. IPCC predicts that global warming will worsen human health conditions, especially in tropical regions. In places like Africa, an increase in temperature signifies an increase in mosquito populations, thus escalating the risk of malaria, dengue and other insect-borne infections. Other regions are also affected. The United States experienced varying levels of malaria outbreaks; in 2006, the United Kingdom was plagued by an outbreak of legionnaires' diseases -- a bacterial lung infection that scientists attribute to global warming. WHO states that global warming will also cause a major increase in insect-borne diseases in Europe. Countries like Azerbaijan, Tajikistan and Turkey might already be in the danger zone for mosquito-borne malaria. However, the ability to tolerate temperature changes differs from region to region. Richer societies can utilize technological advances; for example, the use of more powerful air conditioners and the construction of houses minimize heat retention. On the other hand, developing countries lack not only the technological know-how, but also the resources and public health systems, required to prevent such outbreaks.
Heatwaves. Prolonged periods of abnormally high temperatures can have serious health effects on vulnerable populations, such as the elderly and the sick. This was already seen during the 2003 heatwave in Europe, which claimed approximately 35,000 lives. In a study by Hadley Center for Climate Prediction and Research in the United Kingdom, scientists using computer models showed how greenhouse gas emissions have increased the likelihood of heatwaves. The most common health effect is hyperthermia or heatstroke that can be fatal if left untreated. IPCC predicts that global warming will lead to hot days, followed by nights of high temperatures.
Loss of agricultural productivity. Global warming can result in droughts that can worsen living conditions, particularly in Africa. The World Wild Fund has reported that climate change can drastically alter rainfall pattern, and risk water and food supplies for millions. The IPCC report estimates that approximately 75 million to 250 million people in Africa will be without adequate water and will face food shortages by 2020, as crop productivity will decline by about 50 per cent. Rising temperatures could also result in food shortages for 130 million people in Asia.
Asthma and other respiratory diseases. People suffering from heart problems are more vulnerable to increased temperatures, especially those living in already warm areas, as their cardiovascular system must work harder to keep their body cool. Hot temperatures increase the ozone concentration, which can damage people's lung tissue and cause complications for asthma patients and those with lung diseases.
Increased global warming can also pose a threat to national security, affecting food security, which, in turn, can lead to resource conflicts. At the UN Security Council debate on energy, security and climate, British Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett introduced global warming as a security risk. Despite opposition from many Council members, such as the Russian Federation and China, she argued that the loss of basic needs due to climate change in poor countries can increase the risk of conflicts. Similarly, Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni has labelled climate change as ""an act of aggression by the rich against the poor"".
On a positive note, many countries have now realized the grave consequences of global warming. The United States Supreme Court ordered the Federal Government to look into regulating CO2 emissions. Protest participants in many American cities like Boston and New York have urged the Government to reduce emissions up to 80 per cent by 2050; some 1,300 protest events have been organized in the United States under the Step It Up 2007 banner. In Sydney, Australia, businesses and homeowners switched off their lights to acknowledge the critical issue of global warming. Likewise, corporations are realizing the need to become environmentally friendly. PepsiCo, a global beverage and snack company, plans to purchase 1 billion kilowatt hours of renewable energy over the next year. However, the major impact on reducing the effects of global warming cannot be made without the commitment of those countries that account for the greatest production of greenhouse gases.
The Health Effects Of Global Warming: Developing Countries Are The Most Vulnerable
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) states that the increase in global atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) is primarily due to fossil fuel use and, in a smaller but still significant level, to land-use change.
While there are many aspects of international law on which jurists of all stripes can be expected to agree, we must acknowledge that there is no single, homogenized answer to many legal questions that arise in international disputes.

Abstract
Food insecurity, or the inability of individuals and households to meet their nutritional
requirements in a culturally acceptable manner, is believed to be widespread among
Inuit communities in Northern Canada. This poster reports on a study conducted in
Igloolik, Nunavut, during summer 2007 to develop a baseline understanding of the
magnitude and prevalence of food insecurity in the community, identify high risk groups
and characterize conditions facilitating and constraining food security. Analysis of the
fifty structured surveys reveals a high prevalence of food insecurity. Females and those
obtaining most of their food from the store at highest risk. Lack of money, price of store
food and other commodities, and expense of hunting were identified as major
constraints to being food secure.

Press Release:
Household Food Insecurity at Record High in the North, According to U of T Researchers
Children Throughout Canada Vulnerable
Despite anti-poverty efforts, hunger in Canada has not decreased – and it has now reached epidemic levels in Nunavut, where almost half of households suffer from food insecurity, according to a new study by University of Toronto researchers.
One in six children under the age of 18 in Canada lives in food insecure households, according to Household Food Insecurity in Canada, 2014, a report published by PROOF, a U of T research group.
Household food insecurity is the inadequate or insecure access to food because of financial constraints.
In Canada, rates of food insecurity are monitored by Statistics Canada through the Canadian Community Health Survey. In 2013-14, the food security survey was optional, and Yukon, British Columbia, Manitoba, Newfoundland and Labrador opted out.
High rates of food insecurity have persisted across the provinces and territories that participated in the survey. Food insecurity is a serious public health problem that takes a measurable toll on individual health and well-being, and costs our health care system.
Nunavut continues to have the highest rate of food insecurity in Canada, with 60% of the territory’s children living in food insecure households. Food insecurity in Canada is highest in the North and the Maritimes. Rates across the rest of the country are above 10%.
“The rates in the North suggest a state of emergency,” said Valerie Tarasuk, PROOF Principal Investigator and nutritional sciences professor at U of T’s Faculty of Medicine. “We’ve seen no substantial decrease in rates across the country over the past couple of years, despite poverty reduction strategies in many provinces. We think it’s time for concerted policy action.”
Households with children under 18 were at greater risk than households without children. Across the country, nearly one-third of lone-parent families headed by women were food insecure. Other household characteristics associated with food insecurity included low income, being Aboriginal, being Black, and renting rather than owning one’s home.
While being on social assistance was a major risk factor, the majority of the food secure households in Canada were reliant on employment income.
“We know that social assistance recipients are particularly vulnerable, and the latest numbers show rates of food insecurity as high as 82% among people reliant on social assistance in Nova Scotia and 83% among those in Nunavut. At the same time, we shouldn’t lose sight of the fact that the majority of food insecure households in our country are working families.” said Naomi Dachner, co-author of the report.
In addition to provincial rates of food insecurity, the report examined household food insecurity at the level of census metropolitan areas (CMAs), urban centers with populations of 100,000 or more. The highest rates were found in the New Brunswick cities of Moncton and Saint John and in Peterborough, Ontario, all topping 16%. Quebec City had the lowest rates of food insecurity with 7% of households affected.
The full report, the fourth in a series of annual reports on food insecurity in Canada, will be available to download from PROOF’s website as of Tuesday April 5, 2016.
The series, Household Food Insecurity in Canada, is published by PROOF, a Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) funded research program initiated to identify effective policy interventions to address household food insecurity. All four annual reports (2011-14) are available from the PROOF website proof.utoronto.ca

StraightUpNorth is an interdisciplinary research team that works closely with Northern communities to address complex sustainability issues for the benefit of the people, land and water. (Photo by Gita Ljubicic, StraightUpNorth)
BY Sonia Verma
December 3, 2020
Growing up in Ottawa, Gita Ljubicic wasn’t a fan of the cold. She didn’t even much like the outdoors. She laughs when she says that now, because she has spent a large part of the past 19 years in communities in northern Canada – including travelling and camping – to learn about plants, sea ice, caribou, and environmental change from Inuit Elders and hunters.
Ljubicic, an associate professor in the School of Earth, Environment and Society, is the leader of StraightUpNorth (SUN), an interdisciplinary research team that works closely with Indigenous communities in northern Canada to address complex socio-ecological issues. SUN team members are dedicated to respecting and learning from Indigenous knowledge alongside science to address community-identified priorities.
In fact, Ljubicic’s research often includes community members and organizations as co-authors and contributors, and the SUN team works closely with them every step of the way.
“Community researchers are a vital part of our team,” Ljubicic says. “We learn from each other.”
More: Gita Ljubicic’s work exemplifies McMaster’s commitment to advancing the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
What it is
StraightUpNorth is a growing team of researchers who work with communities across Inuit Nunangat (Inuit homelands, including Nunavut, Nunavik in northern Québec, Nunatsiavut in northern Labrador, and the Inuvialuit Settlement Region in northern Northwest Territories.)
Two consistent research topics for the SUN team are changing weather and ice conditions.
“We’re learning from Inuit communities about what weather, ice, and water conditions are dangerous, what’s good for travel or what’s worrying them,” Ljubicic says.
“We want to improve the ways in which people get information to help keep them safe.”
Another key goal is to learn from Indigenous knowledge holders, and to share their insights according to community guidance, to improve policy-making and decision-making that affect these communities every day.
“Inuit who are travelling, hunting, and harvesting around their communities are doing science every day.”
“We’re trying to help convey what they’re doing.”
SUN team research aims to have both academic and societal impacts, and Ljubicic also wants to equip a new generation of aspiring northern researchers with a foundation of robust information and resources.
How it works
SUN team researchers focus on priorities identified by the Inuit communities they work with. They draw on a range of qualitative and Indigenous research methods to document and share Inuit knowledge in ways that are accessible to a broader audience.
The SUN website has a toolkit for researchers that emphasizes the need for respect, listening and learning, and the importance of tailoring the direction of research to suit community priorities.
So when community members in Gjoa Haven identified a lack of caribou research on King William Island, despite the continued importance of caribou in their diet and way of life, Ljubicic’s team began working with Elder Simon Okpakok to develop a project to understand the connections between caribou and community-well being.
“The caribou are highly relevant to the community, yet there’s very little research in the region,” Ljubicic says. Even though Elders described caribou moving on and off the island seasonally, with some staying on the island all year round, King William Island shows as blank on most caribou range maps, she says.
“So community needs and experiences are not well reflected in wildlife decision-making in the region.”
In Gjoa Haven, as in other communities, her team shares their findings first with community contributors and supporting organizations, and then more broadly with academic, government, and Inuit organizations.
Sea ice research
Ljubicic’s long-term work on sea ice research is shaped by the same commitment to community priorities.
“Sea ice is very important for community members to travel and access areas for hunting, fishing, visiting, even just getting out of town,” she says.
Through various partnerships in the Qikiqtani (Baffin) region of Nunavut, she has been involved in documenting Inuktitut sea ice terminology and Inuit knowledge of sea ice hazards, as well as mapping important ice features and changes.
This work is now contributing to community-driven sea ice monitoring initiatives, like SmartICE and SIKU, that combine environmental monitoring and social media technologies with Inuit knowledge and observations to map and share travel routes, tag dangerous ice conditions, and share photos and stories of hunting and travel.
Why it matters
In Nunavut, it’s mandated that Inuit and scientific knowledge be considered equally when making policy or decisions. But there isn’t always the time, the resources or the will to include Inuit perspectives in broader decision making, Ljubicic says.
“Community members in Gjoa Haven were saying they want to be taken more seriously in decision making and want to document their knowledge — it has always been there, we’re just making it more accessible to a broader audience.”
This is also why Nunavut communities are developing their own environmental monitoring initiatives, to ensure that important observations and hazards are shared in their community to help people stay safe.
Ljubicic and SUN team research associate Natalie Carter are working on a paper, led by two experienced hunters in Pond Inlet, Nunavut, who developed their own way of assessing online weather and ice forecasting products to be more relevant for local use.
“They use and assess the online products, translating them into Inuktitut and sharing relevant weather and ice information over the radio, or to anyone who asks. On their own time, they have essentially created a tailored community forecasting service,” she says.
The goal for these hunters in writing a paper about their work is that they can share what they do with an academic and government audience, so others can learn from their work, too.
The role StraightUpNorth plays
The communities that SUN team members work with are the experts in understanding the dynamics and meaning of their homelands. Where community members or organizations are interested in research partnerships to address local priorities, Ljubicic’s team offers access to new funding sources, a range of collaborative research methods, training opportunities, and connections to broader audiences.
“Everyone knows and respects the Elders and knowledge holders in the community. That’s not going to change,” she says.
“But when they’re trying to communicate their knowledge to incoming researchers, or to wildlife managers who are making quotas, or to scientists surveying lands or waters in ways the community doesn’t agree with, partners like us can help translate or facilitate dialogue, and share Inuit insights in different ways.”

Ashley Rabinovitch - 20 January 2021
When Gary Bosgoed launched his own project consulting firm in 1992, transitioning from a successful professional engineer into his own boss, he had a realization: There was an underdeveloped resource right in front of him.
“When I started working on projects in Traditional territories, I was confused that they weren’t designed to include Indigenous people,” he says almost thirty years after the inception of Bosgoed Project Consultants (BPC). “The first project we did, the contractors we hired were five percent Indigenous. I knew the capacity of the community we were working with and I knew that needed to change.”
As a member of the Peepeekis Cree Nation in southern Saskatchewan, the effort to include Indigenous communities in the projects that impact their lives has motivated Bosgoed throughout his career. In BPC’s first season, he made a plan to offer one hundred percent of his contracting work to Indigenous communities. “We were fifteen percent cheaper and bringing eighty percent of Indigenous workers, instead of five,” he remembers. “It was an excellent opportunity to utilize local resources and get young Indigenous people involved in career-building work.”
The program to provide meaningful opportunity to Indigenous workers solidified into the WorkFirst Community Engagement Program, a practical approach to employment that continues to offer one hundred percent of opportunities to the Indigenous workforce. Over the past three decades, Bosgoed and his team have delivered more than 130 projects through WorkFirst, from preliminary planning to project completion. Indigenous workers comprise at least eighty percent of the workforce for each project.
“WorkFirst takes a standard way of doing things and turns it upside down,” affirms Bosgoed. “Before contractors build their teams, they go into the community to offer work to Indigenous workers. We want Indigenous workers to be treated equally, as access to decent work is incredibly instrumental in shaping a young worker’s sense of purpose and identity.”
As a reflection of the University’s ongoing commitment to highlighting Indigenous scholarship, reflected in its Situated Knowledge, Indigenous Peoples and Place (SKIPP) initiative, UAlberta International has invited Bosgoed to relate the philosophy and impact of WorkFirst to UN SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth during I-Week.
“Through WorkFirst, more Indigenous workers are available to the community and the region, resulting in higher levels of employment,” Bosgoed will share during his 17-minute presentation. “I see less income assistance, more supplier arrangements and partnerships, and more economic growth. I’ve had people come back to me 20 years later thanking me for the confidence they gained from the first project we hired them to complete.”
Bosgoed’s commitment to inclusive, high-quality services has built trust with hundreds of clients across Canada and raised over one hundred million dollars in working capital. He’s travelled as far north as Nunavut, west to British Columbia, and east to Ontario to tackle projects in oil and gas, mining, infrastructure, and waste treatment. He doesn’t mind the travel—he’s just happy to provide meaningful opportunities for Indigenous workers.
“We’re doing a ten million dollar project right now with one hundred percent Indigenous workers, and I credit the team for their efforts to make it work,” he shares. “I can’t live in this community and not do this kind of work. These are my family members and I know what they’re capable of. I’ve never been disappointed.”
Bosgoed will share his insights on SDG 8 and WorkFirst at his Global Goals Talk on Wednesday, February 3rd. The full showcase of speakers can be found here. . ",False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False
vanierinstitute,https://vanierinstitute.ca/in-focus-2019-food-insecurity-in-canada/ ,"Food insecurity in Canada is an issue deeply intertwined with the health and economic well-being of families. While there is no single cause for food insecurity, research shows that both economic insecurity and geographical isolation (in particular, the higher food costs in Northern communities resulting from a lack of year-round rail, road or marine access) contribute to families not having access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs for a healthy life.1
Food-insecure families are more likely to experience adverse effects to their health and well-being, which include restricted mobility and chronic conditions, poor mental health and mental distress.2 This impacts individuals, families and communities, and incurs considerable costs on the health care system – it’s a matter of family well-being and public health.
In recognition of Hunger Action Month, which raises awareness on national, provincial and local levels about hunger in Canada, this edition of In Focus highlights data on food insecurity across the country.
Many Canadians – including children and youth – continue to experience food insecurity
- In 2018, 1 in 4 children and youth under 18 (23%) say they go to bed or school hungry at least sometimes because there is not enough food at home.3
- In 2018, children and youth under 18 accounted for 20% of the population in Canada but 35% of those who accessed food banks in March of that year.4
- In 2015–2016, approximately 16% of households in reporting provinces and territories across Canada5 experienced food insecurity.6
Northern populations and marginalized groups experience disproportionately high rates of food insecurity
- In March 2018, six in 10 people who accessed food banks (59%) were on social assistance or disability-related supports.7
- In 2015–2016, more than half (51%) of households in Nunavut were food insecure – by far the highest rate in Canada and more than three times the average rate of the remaining reporting provinces and territories (11%).8
- In 2015–2016, nearly three-quarters of the children in Nunavut (72%) and one-third of the children in the Northwest Territories (32%) lived in food-insecure households, compared with 16% to 23% among the remaining reporting provinces and territories.9
- Despite the launch of Nutrition North – a food retail subsidy designed to improve food access and affordability in isolated communities – annual rates of food insecurity actually increased in Nunavut between pre-implementation (33% to 40% between 2007 and 2010) and the years following implementation of the program (46% to 56% between 2013 and 2016).10, 11
- Research from 2014 showed that rates of food insecurity among Black people (29%) and Indigenous people (26%) were more than twice as high as the national average (12%).
Data gaps leave us without a clear picture of the prevalence and impact of food insecurity among diverse groups
- The Canadian Community Health Survey (the main source for information on food insecurity in Canada) doesn’t collect data from First Nations reserves, resulting in approximately half of all status First Nations peoples (approximately 300,000) being left out of the picture, and thus underestimating the prevalence of food insecurity.12
- Other diverse groups, including full-time members of the Canadian Armed Forces, people living in institutions and the 235,000 Canadians who experience homelessness in any given year are not represented in national food insecurity data (despite the latter being more vulnerable to food insecurity than the general population).13

eventscloud,https://eu.eventscloud.com/website/614/theme-1-arctic-food-security/ ,"Climate changes in the Arctic have complex ecosystem impacts on human food security and health, both locally and globally. It is important to trace these impacts from their sources in Arctic lands and waters throughout the food web, taking both climate-related policy and human-environment interactions into consideration to know how these changes affect food security, nutrition and health.
People living in Arctic regions rely on both wild-caught and cultivated marine and terrestrial resources for their subsistence and livelihoods. This theme brings together scholars from circumpolar regions whose work examines the impacts of marine and other food sources on the food security and health of people living in Arctic communities and across the globe. As many communities face climate- and socially-mediated constraints on their capacity for self-sufficiency, innovative and resourceful approaches – many of them rooted in Indigenous identity and knowledge – are emerging to solve the crisis of food insecurity.
Emerging Arctic aquaculture initiatives are also contributing to global efforts to improve food security. To meet future demand for fish, particularly in developing countries, global production will need to double by 2030. The scale of this challenge requires research innovations across the whole spectrum of fisheries production and its value chain (http://www.fao.org/3/i3640e/i3640e.pdf). There is significant potential for empowerment of circumpolar Indigenous communities as Arctic food sources are increasingly recognized as contributors to global food security and improved nutrition, in line with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Decade of Action on Nutrition (2016-2025). This empowerment extends to development of the ‘precautionary approach’ with the Central Arctic Ocean fisheries agreement in the high seas, beyond the sovereign jurisdiction of nations. This is actionable at an international scale now.
Despite these opportunities, access to Arctic foods is at times constrained by policy approaches that restrict development of sustainable harvest and aquaculture initiatives. What changes are needed to policy approaches to have greater impact on food security and nutrition, and how might these changes be achieved? Policies are products delivered by the process of diplomacy, with science diplomacy as an international, interdisciplinary and inclusive (holistic) process. What processes will facilitate holistic integration of priorities in the areas of food security so that decisions about harvest and cultivation foster a sustainable and thriving Arctic food ecosystem?
We invite submissions addressing the above mentioned issues, and in particular issues such as:

I'm a partner with Gowling WLG in the environmental and indigenous practices. I'm based in Toronto but I work across the country, in particular in the North quite a bit. We have today with us two speakers for the second of three Year in Review sessions. One was last week on a series of hot topics. The next one is next week and that is about climate change litigation and other related matters. But today we're going to talk about a few things to do with natural resource development in Nunavut. So today we have with us two speakers. One with us right now. That's Ryan Barry, the former Executive Director for the Nunavut Impact Review Board and our other speaker, Senator Dennis Patterson who is the Senator for Nunavut, will be joining us momentarily, we hope. We know he's trying to get online right now. I think we're going to get going and start the conversation and then when the Senator joins he will no doubt catch up. For those of you who know him you will know that he will not have any trouble catching along with the conversation. Introducing the discussion today, I want to just set the stage very briefly. Very briefly and really just say that we want to talk a little bit about the current state of the resource industry in Nunavut and a little bit about the implications of a trend that we're starting to see, or maybe not just starting to see, but are seeing towards the implementation of international initiatives. With this I'm referring to UNDRIP, the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People, as well as some ethical standards for the resource sector that are have been developed internationally and there's discussion about having them have more application in Canada in the resource sector. So we want to talk a little bit about challenges, some trends and some opportunities in this space and we can talk a little bit about the various things that relate to Nunavut as they relate to this trend. So, I'll just set the stage ever so quickly and just say that for those who don't know, and most of you probably do, that there's a bit of a trend in Canada to see the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People implemented, and that would include the implementation of something that's discussed in UNDRIP, which is called Free Prior and Informed Consent. This is the notion that has been developed internationally and now adopted, or in the process of being adopted in Canada, that indigenous people should have a greater say in what happens to them and what happens to their communities as it relates to the development of natural resources and other significant enterprises. This has come up a little bit recently. The Government of British Columbia has passed a piece of legislation saying that UNDRIP, all its legislation, all BC's legislation, needs to be considered in the context of UNDRIP and ensure that it's appropriately framed. The Canadian Government is in the process of developing legislation that would due a similar thing for Canadian legislation. So it's within this context that we wanted to just have these discussions. So perhaps without the Senator with us I think I'm going to ask Ryan to start with some opening comments and then we'll start the conversation. With any luck the Senator gets on the line with us soon. So, Ryan, why don't I ask you to perhaps introduce yourself briefly and then give us some opening thoughts. Thank you.
Ryan: Great. Thank you first of all, Adam, for inviting me and it's a real pleasure to be able to join you and have this discussion, particularly with Senator Patterson, who I'm sure will be joining us very shortly. For those of you on the meeting, the call, my name's Ryan Barry. Until very recently I was serving as the Executive Director of the Nunavut Impact Review Board. I spent the last 13 years living and working out of Cambridge Bay, Nunavut, working the Board. First in a technical capacity and then for the last 9 years or so I was their Executive Director. So of course the Impact Review Board is the environmental assessment or impact assessment authority for Nunavut. So my work involved looking at proposed development across the Territory and that as well as monitoring developments that had proceeded to approval. I've since relocated to Prince Edward Island, more recently, and still actively following the development of Nunavut and the Territories as well. Again, a pleasure to be here, Adam, and I don't know if you wanted me to get into the opening thoughts on challenges facing the regulatory system.
Adam: Sure. Why don't we do that and that would be great. Thanks, Ryan.
Ryan: Absolutely. I think for me when I think about challenges facing resource development in Nunavut, they're very comparable to the jobs as faced in the other Northern Territories but a bit more distinct, or more pronounced, given the physical isolation of Nunavut. The primary challenges I've seen in my experience with assessing the large development projects has been increasingly of the challenge of these operators for raising capital, and the subsequent need for them to phase the development of their projects, and where that's creating some conflicts with regulatory regimes that weren't really designed to consider phase development. This is a problem that's not unique to Nunavut. It's being experienced across Canada in different regimes. But certainly I think it's a bit more pronounced in Nunavut and some of the challenges that make it more pronounced are the high cost of operating, the huge infrastructure deficit that we have in the Territory, the physical isolation, etcetera. I know in probably the last 5 years or so, maybe a little bit more, we've certainly seen more of a trend where even large mining companies have had more difficulty putting the large investments in right away. Building a mine from scratch. Really looking at phase development, getting approval in stages, for initial stages, later stages and then coming back frequently for amendments to approvals to implement as they go. To me, that for the regulatory system has been kind of a number one emerging challenge that really leads into many other areas, and is certainly more pronounced in Nunavut because of the infrastructure deficit. I think recognizing that all Nunavut communities have an infrastructure deficit. There's a lack of investment in roads, power infrastructure, internet bandwidth. Even things like hospitals, etcetera, and all of these in some way do impact upon mining development. Requiring mines to often have to invest more up front in infrastructure and this could be from things like deep sea ports or even community offloading facilities, all the way into ... supports for mental health programs, etcetera. I would start with that as kind of the largest challenge that I've seen facing resource development. There's other smaller challenges, important challenges, as well but to me that's the overarching one that we're dealing with.
Adam: Thanks, Ryan. First of all I'll also mention to the attendees that if you do have questions you can use the Q&A function to pose questions that I'll be able to see and we'll pass along if we've got time for them. So please feel free to do that. Ryan, I wonder, you're background is of course as a regulator. You were working regularly with the resource sector and the mining project proponents that, as you say, have had challenges with phasing and I have seen that myself as well. I guess one question that might be interesting to hear from you about is how have regulators been able to, or not been able to, or have been challenged by these changes? I mean for those of the attendees who don't know the Nunavut Impact Review Board has its offices in Cambridge Bay, Nunavut which is on the Northwest Passage and you fly typically through Yellowknife, Northwest Territories to get there, although you can come across the top, as some of us say. But it's not close to people so it's a challenge and I'm curious a little bit about how, or what, NIRB has been able to do to make itself able to manage this phasing, as you describe it, and other challenges that we are seeing that are phased. As your role as Executive Director did you feel you were able to make some strides in how you deal with that? You were in the position, or you were with NIRB for quite some time, so I presume you would have seen some development in this regard.
Ryan: Thanks, Adam. Certainly I believe sincerely that regulators operate from a stance of wanting to see development occur. To see things go ahead in the right way. Certainly that was always our attitude is that we're there to ensure that development goes ahead respecting the environment, respecting communities and that we make for better development projects in the end. I think for us the challenge that goes with phase development is really that our legislative tools being that the Nunavut Agreement, article 12, for us and for the Nunavut Planning and Project Assessment Act and enabling legislation. Neither one of those, when they were drafted, really contemplated phase development. It really wasn't an upfront issue at the time. So when we look at the legislated tools that we have to assess development there's several pathways that are in the Nunavut Agreement and NuPPAA, the legislation as we refer to it, and those are our options. We don't get to make up new ... options to deal with new and emerging situations. So we have to adapt those tools and use our discretion wherever we haven't to try to make things work. So I think the challenge for myself and my colleagues and for the board still is trying to use those tools and adapt them to these emerging situations. By doing that we look at where have flexibility to adapt information requirements, timelines, consultation requirements and the list goes on. I've always been a bit of a proponent for having regulators have a certain amount of discretion and I think a large part of our Board's success through the years have been the fact that we did, we were waiting quite a while for our Federal legislation to go into place, and that allowed us really to build our track record and to get ... ... use our discretion in a very positive way to make things work. I think that's where we've tried to ensure that things still move forward even if we didn't have express legislative pathway.
Adam: Thanks very much, Ryan. So, I'm going to tell you that I'm going to ask you a little bit more about the Free Prior and Formed Consent and UNDRIP a little bit in a minute, but I think we might have Senator Patterson on line, by telephone, so I'm going to ask him, first of all, if he's there and second of all, Senator, if you are there if you would like to make some opening comments. You missed it but Ryan gave his and we've just been chatting a little bit about some challenges and observations of his. I'll ask, Senator, I think you're there?
Senator: Yes. Good morning. Sorry to be late.
Adam: No trouble at all. Welcome and to everybody else on the line Senator Patterson is the Canadian Senator for Nunavut. He is an active advocate for the Territory and somebody who, if you work and live in Nunavut, you're very well aware of. Senator, why don't I ask you for some opening comments on these issues.
Senator: Okay, well, just to give you a little background. I was privileged to be a member of the NWT Assembly, 16 years until 1995, and in that time I was also involved as Minister of Aboriginal Rights and Constitutional Development in the negotiation of a number of land claim agreements in the North. The NWT was a third party but we were quite involved in those negotiations. Particularly the Nunavut Land Claim Agreement. So I've been quite involved with that landmark land claim and also the effort to establish the Nunavut Territory which went hand and glove with the Nunavut land claim. So when we talk about Inuit involvement, Indigenous participation and development, I do want to emphasize that we are a poster child in Canada, I believe, in Nunavut in terms of reconciliation and the involvement of Inuit in government structures. The Inuit were represented actively in the development of the Nunavut Act, of course in the development of the Nunavut Land Claim Agreement itself, they were a principal party with the Federal government, but they also have been intimately involved with any legislation relating to the regulatory framework in Nunavut, including being involved as a principal party in the development of the Nunavut Project and Planning Assessment Act, NuPPAA. So when we talk about indigenous involvement and development regulatory issues I think we have a very unique and probably the very best situation in terms of aboriginal reconciliation in the country. I want to also point out that, as you all probably know, ... Nunavut ... ... aboriginal groups in Canada and throughout the world most certainly envy, and that is in addition to being major land holders, surface and sub-surface, approximately 18% of the land mass of Nunavut which in itself is 20% of the land mass of Canada. The Inuit also have a guaranteed share of resource revenues under the land claim. Whether those resource revenues come from projects on or under Inuit owned land, or on Crown land in the rest of Nunavut, they have a guarantee royalty share, and of course, a much higher share because they take the Crown share on their own particularly sub-surface lands. Then they also have a guaranteed voice in the regulatory process to their participation in the regulatory bodies in Nunavut. The principal one being NIRB. That participation is guaranteed in the Land Claim Agreement which itself has protection under section 35 of the Constitution recognizing aboriginal rights. So the Land Claim Agreement provisions, extensive provisions, on the regulatory process is constitutionally protected and therefore the role of Inuit in providing advice to the appropriate Minister of the Crown is also constitutionally protected. We have a very strong regime and I know, Adam, we're going to be talking about the introduction of international and ethical standards into regulatory regimes in Canada, but I do want to say that I believe that the Inuit are far ahead of other indigenous groups in having a major voice in government, particularly respecting land and resources in their own homeland. So, I'll just stop there. Maybe I'll just say in closing that since I've been appointed this Senate 10 years ago I have taken a particular interest in resource development in Nunavut, because I see that as the way forward in an area with high unemployment and an area where the public sector is still the main driver of the economy, and I'd like to help work towards a more diverse economy that goes beyond public services and related services. Thank you.
Adam: Sorry. I was on mute. The joys of Zoom. Thanks very much, Senator Patterson. I'll come back to you in a second with a question a little bit more about the international initiatives that we discussed and UNDRIP and the ethical standards for resource sector in a second. But first I wanted to go to Ryan and just ask Ryan, perhaps you could tell, for some of the attendees who aren't familiar with it, I'm wondering if you could just talk a little bit about how NIRB facilitates the Inuit role in resource development. Certainly at least through that process and maybe one or two observations about that in the context of some of the Senator's comments. I'll leave it as a fairly open question but if you maybe talk a little bit about how you see NIRB as the regulator fulfilling some of that the functional of facilitating Inuit participation.
Ryan: Thanks, Adam, and thank you Senator for setting me up because really the start of my response would be going back to the Nunavut Agreement, and as it's been introduced, I'll just point to the fact that the objectives of the Nunavut Agreement, front and center, the central objectives, are increasing the role of Inuit in decision making for projects, for decisions affecting their lands, their resources, their traditional use and occupancy. I think, in my experience in working with the Nunavut Impact Review Board, that's always front and center. We had on our Board, we were very fortunate that our Board has always been predominately Inuit, a number of our board members were negotiators of the Nunavut Agreement through the years as well. So they're able to really impart what their vision was and what they were negotiating for and what they expect to see from regulatory processes such as NIRB. That means that when they were hearing evidence to the certain lens, so to speak, from community members wanting to ensure that their views are respected. I think for regulators like ... the Water Board, the Planning Commission, the Wildlife Board as well, the Management Board, we all have recognized, and I still use we because I'm still used to representing the Board, but I should say they all recognize that the processes that they administer are really a primary mechanism for the public to be involved in decision making. In the Review Boards case, for decisions about proposed development, and where and how development can occur and under what conditions it can occur, that's the primary mechanism. Those processes were certainly hard thought through the negotiation of the Nunavut Agreement. As it has been pointed out, the Boards have a legislative requirement to demonstrate consideration for public concern about the roles of development plans. Also for the potential effect of roles of development on community's traditional land use, etcetera. This is something that the Impact Review Board certainly has always been very careful about, ensuring it's documented, all the reference to have public engagement to physically go to communities to get feedback from communities about proposed development, proposed mitigation, whether that goes far enough. That has to be clearly documented and all the decisions and reports that come from the Board and then on the basis for whether or not projects get approved and under what terms and conditions they get approved. So, much of my previous job certainly focused on what means we can use to create those opportunities for people. How can we physically go to communities? How can we use new technologies like online resources to both disseminate information and to collect feedback, while not forgetting some of the more traditional methods, like physical in person meetings, Canadian radio shows, also respecting language requirements. Ensuring that everyone has fair access to documents in official languages of Canada as well as the official languages of Nunavut, so Inuktitut and Inuinnaqtun. Those were really the core of the job, is also trying to make information accessible, often very technical information, packaged in a way that people can access and that they can give, again, their informed feedback about what they believe should occur for our proposed development.
Adam: Ryan, one of the things, thanks for those comments, one of the things that I think, to Southern eyes anyway, is quite striking in a NIRB process and other regulatory hearing processes in Nunavut, is the fact that Inuit are encouraged to be present and to participate in the hearings. So it's something I think after you've spent years, as you have working with the hearings and the related processes you might take for granted a bit, but I found quite striking that the amount to which or the number of times anyway Inuit are part of the hearing. Maybe you could talk just briefly a bit about that.
Ryan: Yeah, sure, I'll do that really quickly. I think, again, for the Impact Review Boards processes, in particular, a really important part of formal public hearing process is something that is called Community Roundtable Portion, where representatives from potentially impacted communities are invited. Their travel is paid for and they sit at the table and provide their feedback directly to the Board and have time carved out of the agenda to do so. I know for the Board members, hearing directly from community members is extremely important, and also what's often shared is not just concerns about a project end. Their concerns, which are very important, but often their traditional knowledge, or Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit, about how they use the land, the area in question, how its been used by their ancestors and how they wanted to see it available for use by their children or their grandchildren. You really only get that part through the stories that are shared at Canadian roundtables and through the participation of community members in the public hearing processes. I am familiar with how sometimes the processes and impact assessments in South of 60, I think we've always been fortunate that we're able to have a slightly more flexible process. We rely on the Inuit tradition or oral communication and the way that that enriches the decision making, I would hope would be evident through the decisions that the reports of the Board produces. You'll see it clearly documented, direct quotes, attributions to community members and how that's influenced the decision making, and showing the importance of different aspects of the assessment.
Adam: Thanks very much, Ryan. I will, as I say, I would agree that it is different than South of 60 and interestingly Senator Patterson's already commented on the difference between Nunavut regulatory process and processes elsewhere in Canada and I don't entirely disagree, Senator, with you characterization of Nunavut of the poster child for Inuit participation or indigenous participation. But what I thought I'd turn the conversation to now, a little bit, is the question about what one might call the advent of UNDRIP. But certainly we're now moving towards a situation where an international initiative, in the form of UNDRIP and the concept of Free Prior and Informed Consent, how it's going to somehow factor into the Canadian legal landscape and that will look different in BC where we already, as I said before, have seen that process start through legislation. We understand that the Government of Canada is seeking to introduce legislation based on what we saw most recently in a private member's Bill about the same topics last year, or early this year I guess it was, so, Senator, perhaps I could just turn to you and ask whether you have any particular views about the apparent desire of the Canadian government to take on initiatives like UNDRIP and to make them part, somehow, of Canadian law. I say this knowing that we don't really know what this is going to look like yet. So, I'm not trying to pin you down. I'm just interested in your general comments about how these two concepts, that is Canadian law and indigenous international concepts overlap.
Senator: Okay sure, Adam, thank you. I'm aware of the Canadian active participation in developing the 2015 UN sustainable development goals and the support for environmental, social and government standards, and perhaps more recently, a debate about whether these standards should include indigenous participation. I guess the first thing I would say is, reckoning back to what I said at the opening, is that not only do we have a regime in Nunavut, perhaps it's out of respect for the 85% Inuit majority in Nunavut, but it is undoubtedly a model regime for involvement of indigenous people which was co-developed by indigenous people with the Inuit, but I want to emphasize again that the Nunavut Land Claim Agreement legislation is not just another Bill, another statute in Canada, it is a statute that has constitutional protection by virtue of section 35. I think it's a very strong and solid foundation, a detailed foundation, for Inuit participation in the regulatory process in Nunavut. When you look at what I think most reasonable people would say is that at least unclear, if not generalistic terms, like FPIC, Free Prior and Informed Consent. When you compare those few words with the detailed provisions of the Nunavut Land Claim Agreement, and legislation like the Nunavut Project Planning and Assessment Act, we have a well defined regime with now quite a body of precedent over the years since the claim was finalized in 1993. I guess what I'm hopeful, frankly, is that in the initiatives that Canada takes to hitch our wagon to international standards and international work that is being done in this area, must respect that we've already, and by the way the Land Claim Agreement took, conservatively, 20 years to negotiate, it painstakingly developed in full collaboration with indigenous people, so I wouldn't want to ever see, however notorious they might seem and however they might be appropriated in other regions of the country, I wouldn't want to see those international standards displace what has been a hard won and very carefully evolving regulatory regime in Nunavut. Which seems to have, I would say, the respect of governments who appoint members to the regulatory boards but also to industry proponents who work very hard to understand and respect their obligations to enter into impact and benefit agreements and provide incentives to employment and business opportunities. Don't let the international standards displace what we've developed in Nunavut, in particular, and secondly, I think what we've learned in Nunavut is that successful development of these kinds of standards must be meaningfully co-developed. Rather than handed as a fait accompli, for example indigenous stakeholders, that they be involved in the ground work of developing these standards. Now the Federal Government had committed to co-developing the UNDRIP legislation that they've committed to introducing to Parliament as recently as in the throne speech of last month, and I'm not sure really how that's going, but I was pleased to see that commitment to have indigenous organizations being involved in the co-development of that legislation and I think the same applies for international standards that may help guide us in our regulatory regimes, broadly, in Canada.
Adam: Thanks, Senator. I'm going to just ask a variation on the question or perhaps just a small additional piece about this. See what your comments are. I know that a few years ago when there was an announcement by, at the time then President Obama which seems like a lifetime or two ago now and our Prime Minister, there was an announcement about a moratorium on off-shore oil and gas activity in the Arctic. There were statements made by, I think, all three Territorial Premiers to the effect that they had concerns that this was taking decision making power away from Northerners and complaining that that was inappropriate. I'm curious, do you think that taking potential international standards, like the ethical ones we just discussed or the FPIC requirements under UNDRIP, do you think that that could be seen as taking away decision making from Northern decision makers as well? Senator, I'll ask you.
Senator: Well that's why I'm saying that since Canada is committed to lining up with those kinds of international standards, and of course that applies to also protected areas which is an issue of great concern and interest to Territorial Governments, it has to be done in a meaningful co-development manner. That did not happen with the Artic oil and gas moratorium. It was firmly condemned by Territorial Governments and indigenous organizations in the North, and I like to think there might have been some lessons learned from that, because subsequently the Federal Government has involved the Inuit in consultations with the NWT in developing plans for the off-shore in the Beaufort, and the Federal Government also supported the NIRB to do a very broad ranging strategic environment assessment of the same issues with respect to the off-shore in the Eastern Arctic. Yes, we must not do these things top down even though they might start at the UN and internationally. The Federal Government has to do its homework within its own country if it's going to have credibility and acceptance of these standards.
Adam: Thanks very much, Senator. Maybe I'll turn to you Ryan and just ask the question about the UNDRIP and FPIC. The way it's being presented, and I've heard others actually comment on this and suggest that perhaps that UNDRIP or FPIC as it is understood anyway now, is something that might be redundant in the context of several regulatory regimes in the North, in particular in Nunavut. I'm curious what you might comment about that.
Ryan: I'll have to preface my comments with saying that I'm one of the few people on the call that's not a lawyer. So I'll start from there, as an impact assessment practitioner I guess, I'm answering. I agree with a lot of what the Senator just shared. I think, for me, when I'm asked this question I look at the integrated system, the resource management system that was established through the Nunavut Agreement, and I can't help but recognize it. I think it was ahead of its time in many ways as it kind of put in place the tools that are necessary, I think, to achieve the sort of self-determination that is desired or the objective behind some of these international initiatives. It seems to me where the systems are in place that were developed with the Nunavut Agreement, where they are respected and where they are followed, they can achieve those same answers and objectives. I would focus more on, from my ... the world, how what is meaningful engagement? What does that look like and how does that evolve through time? If you go back 20 years ago about what regulators and what other groups ... has made meaningful engagement through these regulatory processes. It's a lot different now and that evolves naturally with new technologies and new ways to connect with communities and to design processes a little bit organically. But for me when I'm thinking about this question of Free Prior and Informed Consent, I do kind of go down the same road as the Senator in thinking of how can that be achieved through the existing tools that we have, the legislative tools, respecting the Nunavut Agreement, the other land claims agreements as well. To me it's very topical. We have, I think in Nunavut right now, one of the members of the legislative assembly was raising questions about the revisiting the government's uranium policy and really looking at what could be the role of having community public sites to revisit whether or not uranium exploration and development should be allowed in the Territory. I think that was something that as our Board, the Impact Review Board, was having to assess a uranium mining project at the time when they worked these uranium policies in place and people were raising questions about our community is Inuit community should be able to have public sites and decide for ourselves whether or not we want to see uranium development. But then the talks kind of break down a bit when you talk about what would that look like? How would each community be involved and respect that? Are people recognizing that is the system we have in place through this integrated resource management system where we have Boards that are tasked with these big overarching questions, land use planning decisions about what types of elements should be allowed to occur, where and under what conditions, before projects can even be proposed. To me, I bring it back it to if land use plans can be put into place and be revisited every now and again to ensure that they're current, and then they address some of these bigger ticket items as well.
Adam: Thanks, Ryan. I'm just going to ask you a follow up question. Sort of along these lines and this is one question that you could answer over several hours, if you had the time, and you don't. So I'll ask you for some initial thoughts. I'm just going to take us back to UNDRIP and FPIC and this question of implementing, and I know we don't know what the law requires, but if we were to assume for a second that it created some sort of different requirement that is currently in the legislation, and I'm speaking of NuPPAA, the legislation that created and guides, NIRB, but how might NIRB and other IPGs help to implement these standards? Do you think that that's something that they are equipped to do? I know it's hard to answer the question based on the fact that we don't know what it really looks like, but assuming that there is something additional that they have to do, do you think they're in a position to do that and work with the stakeholders, with whom they work already, to do that?
Ryan: Short answer is yes. Realistically the Boards are often having to look at implications of Federal legislation. It's something that is a reality. The government makes changes to the Fisheries Act that has trickle down implications for the regulatory system, as just one example. To me it works the same way with the government looking at international agreements. Certainly we investigated this a little bit, strategic environmental assessment, as the Senator referenced as well. I think that there is a place for the regulatory boards in Nunavut, and the other Territories, to consider what role do they play in helping to implement some of these Federal government level agreements to respect international standards, etcetera, we, still I'm using the royal we, but the impact of ... when I was working for the Board, certainly we get asked to ensure that our impact statement guidelines set out some of the same information requirements that would be in different international agreements. To me, it's nothing new. It's always a challenge that regulatory boards are facing is trying to come up with creative ways that respect the known legislation and respects the emerging international agreements and legislation.
Adam: Thanks very much for that, Ryan. I'm going to turn to you now, Senator Patterson, and ask you sort of a similar question and that is, how do you think government could assist this? I'm assuming for the sake of this discussion that legislation does get passed implementing UNDRIP in Canada and that it does have some effect in Nunavut. How do you think that government, I'm thinking Federally, principally right now, might better support resource development in Nunavut through this initiative?
Senator: Okay, well first of all it's important to note, I think, that while the regulatory boards like NIRB are quasi-judicial independent bodies they do depend on the Federal government to provide financial support to allow them to carry on their work. So they are reliant on the government to do their work and to get their funding. There have been some challenges with the operation of boards and such simple matters as timely appointment of board members when vacancies occurred. It's an Order in Council process that has often put boards precariously close to losing quorum. But the other thing is that I think there should be more support for these regulatory boards to train and orient board members. I know the NIRB has set up some processes to help board members prepare for those very important responsibilities, but I don't think that has happened across the other regulatory boards and I believe there could be more than, on the part of government, to make sure that board members are adequately equipped to deal with these complex issues including, as you say, dealing with international standards to which Canada might subscribe. The other point I'd like to make about government support is that we are seeing, I think in the evolution of the regulatory regime in Nunavut, we're seeing that even the organizations, regionally and Territorial, that's Nunavut Inuktitut territorially and the three regional associations, are playing a very active role in the regulatory process and in managing their lands and their environment. But increasingly it seems to me that hunters and trappers organizations, in particular, which are community organizations that are basically run by volunteers on pretty well threadbare budgets, they are having an increasing role in blending traditional knowledge with science, which is going on in every regulatory hearing, and of course with input into environmental matters around management of renewable resources like climate change, etcetera, and I think if the Federal Government truly values indigenous input, and I'm sure that is true, then organizations like hunters and trappers organizations should be able to access participant funding through the regulatory boards to do their work. Because right now they're relying on outside resources, and I don't mean to really criticize the World Wildlife Fund or Ecojustice, but they're relying on outside, dare I say, Southern based resources, Oceans North is another one, to help them participate in these regulatory hearings and I think they shouldn't have to rely on outside sources. They should be able to have their own resources so that they can more independently participate in these sessions. The other big pull, of course, in the North on the part of the Federal Government, is the oft observed huge deficiency in infrastructure in Nunavut, and I don't want to belabour that, but if we had more Federal support for basic infrastructure like airports, roads and ports, that would immensely aid the climate for investment and orderly development in Nunavut. Thank you.
Adam: Thanks very much, Senator Patterson, thanks very much. We only have a few minutes left so I'm just looking, we had a few questions come in, and I'm just going to look at a couple of them and ask one or two things. Just see if we can entertain a few and I apologize because we won't get to all of the questions. I'm going to touch on a couple of comments that you've both been talking a little bit about and that is the application of IQ, or traditional knowledge. For those who don't have experience in Nunavut, IQ is the Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit, which I'm badly pronouncing by the way so I'm going to stick with IQ, but the fact that it's used regularly and is required to be contemplated in the regulatory process. So one question that I'm going to paraphrase slightly is, that as Nunavut's regulatory environment continues to develop and there's more familiarity with IQ, how do you, and I'll start with Ryan, see the science/IQ dynamic (I think that's a good way of referring to it actually, this interaction between quote/unquote modern science and IQ) that dynamic evolving and where is the future for that and do we have the right balance between IQ and modern science and is that part of, perhaps, reconciliation? A few different ideas there but, Ryan, maybe you could give us a few thoughts on it.
Ryan: Sure. I think that's a big question and maybe I'll unpack it from the last of it. Is that part of reconciliation? I would think so and I think what you'll find across many Canadian universities, in particular, is that is an active part of their own plans to try to further reconciliation is to look at when they're conducting studies how they can do it in a way that is more respectful of traditional and local knowledge holders and having them directly involved in designing and implementing studies. I think for regulatory processes such as the Impact Review Boards, there's always been a focus on ... the terminology often ... used to be traditionally ... or traditional knowledge more frequently now Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit is used to refer to the Inuit way of knowing things that have always been known. I think initially when people are looking at that they were believing that there was a conflict between science and IQ and saying how do you reconcile what you're hearing from science versus what you're hearing from IQ. Which in reality, at least in our processes, was not usually the case. Usually you're hearing people speaking about things from two different perspectives and two different knowledge sources. Very often they're saying the same thing. If we're talking about something like impacts of a role's development to Caribou, it's one thing to hear from a very experienced biologist that's gone up and done studies and said, ""We realize the Caribou typically migrate this way. This is why we're recommending we design the project to minimize effects."", and then you hear from a local knowledge holder that says, ""Look. I harvest those hamels. They're incredibly important to my livelihood and my culture and I think I understand them pretty well and I can tell you that what you're designing there, I don't think it will work. And here's why I don't think it will work."" You try to find the middle ground of what in fact will work while respecting those sources of knowledge. I do think that we've been trying to, through the Impact Review Board process, they've been trying to elevate the respect for Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit by interweaving it through all impact assessment guidelines and guidance and the questions that are asked. I think we're seeing researchers have more respect for the need to consider and to have their research efforts guided by local knowledge in a more meaningful way. So that's how I see things evolving, optimistically, and I do like to think that when we're talking about adaptive management approaches too, the Senator referenced hunters and trappers organizations in Nunavut, and in my view those are really your on the ground knowledge holders. Which resources of Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit, who in an adaptive management approach can say, ""Look, we're starting to see effects of development. We need to implement better mitigation and to have that in more real time as well as projects do come up.""
Adam: Thanks very much, Ryan. Senator, we only have a minute or two left, so I'm just going to ask you if you have anything you'd like to add to that before I turn to you both and ask for some closing thoughts.
Senator: I'd just to like to reiterate what Ryan said that it's important that in government interventions and proponent submissions in the regulatory process to be aware and address traditional knowledge. One way of doing this is to hire Inuit advisors and also to understand that the Inuit language is the carrier of traditional values so every meeting and every process, and I think the regulatory boards do it to a fault, should be very user friendly to the unilingual participants, who are the Elders who are the carriers of that knowledge. Thank you.
Adam: Thank you, Senator. So I'll turn to Ryan for your brief wrap up, if you will.
Ryan: Thanks, Adam. I'll be very brief. I think the focus of this discussion was on challenges to Nunavut's regulatory system and I hope we've touched on a lot of those. I think the parting shot for me would be, the things that could go a long way towards improving the current state of affairs, would be seeing more approved land use plans in place that are there to guide them. Getting land use plans in place that have the buy in from industry as well as local communities. It's a huge task but that's something that would really go a long way towards addressing some of the current challenges as well.
Adam: Thank you, Ryan. Maybe next time we can talk about the land use plans exclusively. There's always lots of ... out there. Senator Patterson, perhaps you could give us your brief closing comments. Would be super.
Senator: Thank you very much, Adam. I believe that we have spoken about the regulatory regime in Nunavut and no doubt Ryan and I are biased. But I think we have spoken about it with pride and as a model for the rest of Canada, and maybe even other parts of the world, for genuine efforts to achieve reconciliation with the Inuit who were first Canadians in the North as ... used to say but also Canadians first. So there's lots of positive lessons to be learned about how things have evolved in Nunavut. Ryan did touch on one big feeling, to be frank, and that is that despite massive efforts and expenditures we're still struggling with developing land use plans in Nunavut. I do want to say that while the independence of the Nunavut planning commission should be always respected it is to me unfortunate that the Federal government, which has funded the planning commission generously, I believe, over the years has perhaps stood by helpless in the face of no deliverables, no credible deliverables, from the planning commission and that's a hole in what was supposed to be an integrated regime that we shouldn't overlook. I hope it can be fixed and addressed because it's as Ryan said. I just want to say in closing then, Adam, that I do believe the initiatives, to bring in international standards and benefit from work that's been developed internationally, while they are important they must be done in a way which respects good work that has been done at least in our region of Canada in setting up a framework that does respect indigenous rights holders. I frankly hope that any legislation that has developed in Canada, in respect to these subjects, will respect that the Nunavut Land Claim Agreement and the Nunavut Act should have primacy before other standards that have been developed in other places. So I do believe that we have an investment climate in Nunavut that is welcoming because the Inuit majority have a share in the revenues and a real stake in finding ways of win/win ways of mitigating impacts and making projects work. But it needs support and acceptance by governments and by proponents. I hope our discussion today has been helpful to those of you who have participated and listened intently, thank you. I'll also just say that I am always open to providing advice to folks who may want to better understand the Nunavut regulatory regime and how to successfully interface with the regulatory boards and the communities in Nunavut so we can continue to develop our huge renewable, and for that matter, non-renewable natural resource potential. Thank you.
Adam: Thank you very much, Senator, I'm going to take this very quick chance to say thank you to the two of you for agreeing to fit us into your very busy schedules and I know you both have lots on the go and we really appreciate you taking the time to join us today and to discuss this. I'm pleased that we've had good attendance and attendance from across the country and across the North. I can tell you that just seeing some of the names of people who sent in some questions and such. I do apologize that we couldn't get to more. I look forward to having another session not a lot difference than this in the not too distant future where we can talk about issues of importance to Northerners again, in the context of environmental and resources. So thank you all. Have a good day and I will ask the technical people to end the call now. Thank you very much. . ",False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False

nih,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3478014/ ,"Global Health—A Circumpolar Perspective
Global health should encompass circumpolar health if it is to transcend the traditional approach of the “rich North” assisting the “poor South.” Although the eight Arctic states are among the world’s most highly developed countries, considerable health disparities exist among regions across the Arctic, as well as between northern and southern regions and between indigenous and nonindigenous populations within some of these states.
While sharing commonalities such as a sparse population, geographical remoteness, harsh physical environment, and underdeveloped human resources, circumpolar regions in the northern hemisphere have developed different health systems, strategies, and practices, some of which are relevant to middle and lower income countries.
As the Arctic gains prominence as a sentinel of global issues such as climate change, the health of circumpolar populations should be part of the global health discourse and policy development.
In recent years the term “global health” has largely replaced “international health” and attempts have been made to promote a standardized definition.1–3 Despite its intention to move beyond the mindset of international development assistance implicit in “international health,” global health is still very much preoccupied with how the “rich North” can contribute to improving the health of low- and middle-income countries in the “poor South.” Thus, most grants on global health offered by governmental and nongovernmental agencies are usually restricted to interventions in low- and middle-income countries.
In this Commentary we argue that an important perspective—the circumpolar one—has been missing in the global health discourse and that the circumpolar perspective has much to contribute and gain by being part of global health research, practice, and policy development. The usual “north–south” orientation in exchanges and dialogue is given a new twist in that the northern regions within the rich North can be considered part of the low-income “South” in some respects. Global health concerns do not stop at high latitudes.
The lack of awareness of the circumpolar world is exemplified in a map accompanying an article on global trends in infant and child mortality published by a prestigious medical journal.4 The world’s largest island—Greenland—has completely disappeared, and is replaced by ocean! It is all the more ironic in that there is no lack of health indicator data from Greenland, where a high quality national statistical system exists and extensive health research has been undertaken for decades.5
The eight countries that are members of the Arctic Council (Canada, Denmark with its self-governing territories of Greenland and Faroe Islands, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden, and the United States) constitute some of the world’s most industrialized and developed nations. With the exception of Russia, these Arctic States occupy the highest ranks in most health indicators. For example, in 2010, Norway, the United States, Canada, and Sweden ranked within the top 10, and Finland, Iceland, and Denmark ranked within the top 20 on the Human Development Index, while Russia ranked sixty-fifth.6 Yet substantial health disparities exist across the northern regions in different countries, and between the northern and southern regions within countries. Global health maps often gloss over the large health gaps that exist in some northern regions such as Nunavut in Canada by assigning it the same color code as the rest of the country. Nation-based comparisons thus dilute and hide important regional challenges within countries.
What constitutes the circumpolar world? We have identified 27 regions (Figure 1) that constitute the northernmost administrative units of the Arctic states (Alaska; the three northern territories of Canada; the northern counties of Norway, Sweden, and Finland; and various northern republics, oblasts, and autonomous regions of the Russian Federation) and several island-states in the North Atlantic (Greenland, Iceland, and Faroe Islands). All these regions are either wholly or have part of their territories located above 60°N. Together they encompass 17 million square kilometers, slightly more than 10% of the planet’s total land area, with a total population of just under 10 million. Note that in this article we use the term “circumpolar” to refer to the northern hemisphere only, thus excluding from consideration the Antarctic with its small transient population.
The population of the circumpolar regions is noted for its ethnic diversity, especially in the presence of many indigenous peoples, some of whom cross international boundaries (such as the Inuit, Athapaskans, and Sami). Indigenous people are the overwhelming majority in some regions such as Nunavut and Greenland, where they account for more than 85% of the total population.7 However, across the Arctic as a whole they are a small minority, yet they carry a disproportionate burden of disease as a result of rapid social and economic transitions.
The health status of the 27 regions fall into four distinct patterns, which are remarkably consistent regardless of the health indicator used, whether the annual incidence rate of tuberculosis (Figure 1), life expectancy at birth, or infant mortality rate. The Nordic countries (including Iceland and Faroe Islands) tend to have the best health indicators, and there is little difference between northern and southern regions within these countries, or between the indigenous Sami and the majority population.8 Alaska, Yukon, and the Northwest Territories are similar in that their nonindigenous populations have a health status that is comparable (or even better) than the national population; however, their indigenous populations, accounting for 18%, 25%, and 50% of the total population of these three regions, respectively, tend to fare substantially worse. Greenland and Nunavut, inhabited predominantly by Inuit on opposite sides of Davis Strait, are remarkably similar in having health status that are substantially worse than that of Denmark and Canada—life expectancy about 10 years shorter, and infant mortality about three times higher.9 Russia as a whole is experiencing a health crisis and its northern regions have some of the worst health indicators among the 27 Arctic regions. As an example of interregional health disparities, the infant mortality rate during the period 2005 through 2009 in the worst region (Koryakia in Russia, 28/1000 live births) is 14 times that of the best region (Iceland, 2/1000 livebirths).7
The social determinants of health are as important in circumpolar regions as elsewhere. The relationship between health status and measures of economic well-being such as per capita gross domestic product (GDP), however, is in the shape of an inverted U (Figure 2). In the Arctic, the observation that “more wealth = better health” is distorted by the fact that large scale natural resource development (oil, gas, diamond mining) in several regions has resulted in their very high GDP, while the overall health of the population lags behind that of other regions without such developments. Globally, parallel situations can be found in certain oil and mineral-rich countries in the Middle East and Africa compared with their less well-endowed neighbors. GDP also masks the fact that wealth generated within the Arctic tends to leave the regions, and that it is also not equitably distributed within the regions. Again, ample examples exist globally.
Different health care systems have evolved in the 27 Arctic regions. While generally reflective of the larger national health systems (such as health care financing), these regional systems also attempt to adapt to the widely dispersed and sparse population, harsh physical environment, and underdeveloped human resources. These regional health care systems differ in their governance and organization, integration of primary care with public health, intersectoral coordination, reliance on nonphysician personnel in extended roles, special consideration for culturally appropriate care to indigenous people, human resources management and development, and the use of innovative information technologies. On a per capita basis and relative to national norms, health care is generally more expensive in Alaska, northern Canada, and northern Russia, whereas in the other regions, they are not significantly different from the rest of the country. Greenland is unique in having a per capita expenditure that is only 60% that of Denmark.10 Few internationally comparable health system indicators beyond per capita expenditures are consistently available across the circumpolar North.
Circumpolar countries and regions have much to learn from one another.11 Collectively they also have valuable lessons to offer other countries, especially low- and middle-income countries. Marginalized populations exist in many of these countries, with perhaps even wider health disparities. The geography of scattered, far-flung communities with health care challenges is certainly not unique to the Arctic. Temperate and tropical countries have islands, oases, outposts, etc., that can benefit from the solutions of circumpolar regions, especially in the use of telecommunication and transportation, and the training and deployment of locally recruited health workforce. Despite their being in some of world’s richest countries, circumpolar regions also lack capacity in advanced higher education and health research,12 and thus can benefit from innovations in these areas developed in resource-poor countries.
Circumpolar regions are overlooked by the World Health Organization, which has mostly been engaged in programs that are targeted at low- and middle-income countries. When it was announced that Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper would cochair the UN Commission on Women and Children’s Health, leaders of northern indigenous people such as the Inuit applauded its goals but stressed the equally pressing needs of northern indigenous women and children, who are excluded from this “global” initiative.13
Circumpolar health practitioners, researchers, and policymakers have developed their own mechanisms for international collaboration such as the triennial congresses, national societies, and networks of researchers, with increased activities over the recent International Polar Year (2007–2008).14,15 The intergovernmental Arctic Council created in 1996, which also includes indigenous people’s organizations as “permanent participants,” has been primarily focused on political and environmental issues, and human health has been of peripheral interest and subsumed under sustainable development and environmental monitoring. The creation of the Arctic Human Health Expert Group in 2009 reflects the Council’s recognition of the need for health perspectives. In February 2011, the health ministers of Arctic States met in Greenland and jointly issued the Nuuk Declaration, outlining areas of common concerns and priorities for action.16 It remains to be seen how national and regional governments respond and translate this declaration into concrete health policies.
The Arctic has gained global prominence in recent years. It is now seen as a sentinel of the consequences of global climate change.17 It has also gained strategic importance because of its untapped natural resources and increased commercial and military potential. Inuit organizations have drawn international attention to the devastating impact of climate change on their way of life.18 Northern indigenous people have joined forces with “small island developing states” in programs such as Many Strong Voices to address adaptation to global climate change.19
In conclusion, we propose that for global health to be truly global, it needs to include the circumpolar perspective. Circumpolar health is global health.

unece,http://unece.org/environment/news/arctic-council-welcomes-unece-work-black-carbon ,"Arctic Council welcomes UNECE work on black carbon
While increasing carbon dioxide levels are the dominant factor contributing to climate change in the Arctic, short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs) also play a significant role. Targeting SLCPs by reducing black carbon and methane emissions will help to slow Arctic warming in the near term.
The importance of reducing black carbon was emphasized at a Ministerial meeting of the Arctic Council in Iqaluit, Nunavut, Canada on 24 April 2015, in which UNECE participated as an observer. Arctic Council Member States are Canada, Denmark (including Greenland and the Faroe Islands), Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russian Federation, Sweden, and the United States of America— all of which are UNECE members.
As black carbon emitted both within and outside of the Arctic region contributes to Arctic warming, reducing transboundary air pollution is critical. UNECE therefore invited the Arctic Council to explore opportunities for closer cooperation with its Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution (CLRTAP) in order to reduce black carbon emissions. In particular, synergies could be found with the work under the newly revised Protocol to Abate Acidification, Eutrophication and Ground-level Ozone (Gothenburg Protocol), which now also encompasses emission reduction commitments for fine particulate matter (PM2.5) including black carbon. Already, in accordance with a decision by Arctic Environment Ministers in 2013, Arctic Council States and other Parties to CLRTAP have, for the first time, submitted national emission inventories for black carbon, which will assist in identifying emission trends and mitigation opportunities.
Foreign ministers at the Arctic Council meeting acknowledged the contribution of UNECE to the work of the Council. Working with the United States Chairmanship, other Arctic States and relevant programmes and bodies under them and CLRTAP, UNECE will further explore strengthened collaboration in the coming months.

RDÉE Canada and its members have identified priority issues common to the Francophone and Acadian communities and the green economy:
- Mobilize and engage key partners
- Raise awareness in communities
- Support the implementation of green economy projects
Definition used by the United Nations Environment Program: A green economy is an economy that results in improved human well-being and social equity, while significantly reducing environmental risks and ecological scarcities. In its simplest expression, a green economy can be thought of as one which is low carbon, resource efficient and socially inclusive. In a green economy, growth in income and employment should be driven by public and private investments that reduce carbon emissions and pollution, enhance energy and resource efficiency, and prevent the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services.
RDÉE Canada is aware of the challenges of sustainable development, here and elsewhere, and is committed to aligning its issues with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals for 2030.
The shift to a green economy is a hot issue that requires innovation and a long-term vision. Within the Network, this concern is reflected in various initiatives to help the Francophone and Acadian communities think about this issue and explore sustainable initiatives.
Manitoba’s Éco-Ouest project: An RDÉE Canada initiative
Created in April 2014, the Éco-Ouest project is an initiative of RDÉE Canada and the four western Francophone economic development organizations: the Conseil de développement économique des municipalités bilingues du Manitoba (CDEM), the Conseil de la coopération de la Saskatchewan (CCS), the Conseil de développement économique de l’Alberta (CDÉA) and the Société de développement économique de la Colombie-Britannique (SDÉ).

Green economy awareness strategy
On June 5, 2016, International Environment Day, RDÉE Canada launched a green economy awareness strategy. The document suggests various green courses of action for the school environment, outlines the CEPEO's eco-responsible program, describes the program’s best practices and documents the lessons learned during its implementation.
Green team factsheet
A green team is a committee of employees who want to improve their environmental impact and that of their workplace. The committee will be supported by management and will report to a decision-maker. It will include, as much as possible, employees from different areas of the company (e.g., finance, administration, production and human resources).
Factsheet for executives
Each company has its own specific environmental approach. Three avenues of exploration are presented in this factsheet to help executives identify specific, measurable actions for their company.
Planning for a sustainable future
At the invitation of Environment and Climate Change Canada, RDÉE Canada submitted a brief at the consultations to develop the 2016–2019 Federal Sustainable Development Strategy. RDÉE Canada and its Network recommended 10 steps to promote the emergence of truly sustainable development across Canada.

aljazeera,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2013/7/8/nunavut-and-the-future-of-canadas-arctic ,"Inuit challenge Canadian government over failures on Nunavut deal’s 20th anniversary.
Iqaluit, Canada – Royal Canadian Air Force jets will streak across the arctic sky on Tuesday, part of celebrations marking the 20th anniversary of the agreement that created Nunavut, a northern territory home to about 30,000 native Inuit people.
It was the largest indigenous land claim in Canada’s history covering 2 million square kilometres, or about eight times the size of the United Kingdom.
But as the fighter jets fly high in the sky to mark the day, on the ground the celebrations will be modest. About 50 percent of the Inuit live in dire poverty, one-third reside in overcrowded and dilapidated housing, and half cannot afford to buy enough food to eat.
The people of Nunavut will on average live 10 years less than others across the country. Canada is tied for fourth in the world in life expectancy, but if Nunavut were a country, it would be 67th, ranking near Nepal and Tajikistan.
The scene in the capital Iqaluit will be a microcosm of the Canadian government’s approach to Arctic sovereignty. While Prime Minister Stephen Harper’s Conservative government has pledged hundreds of millions for new military infrastructure to assert Canada’s claim to the resource-rich Arctic, it has focused less on socioeconomic development in Nunavut, though it states otherwise.
“This Government is committed to ensuring that Northern economic development occurs in a way that directly involves those who live and work in the North,” said John Duncan, Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development.
Since the 1970s, the Inuit have changed the face of Canada and established a unique international cultural presence through music, films and visual art, while bolstering the use of Inuktitut, the Inuit language, at home.
Many Nunavummiut are preoccupied with day-to-day survival, but a young, educated and ambitious minority is intent on guiding what is still in many ways a nomadic hunting civilisation out of poverty.
Nunavut finds itself at the confluence of some of the largest resource extraction projects. Multibillion dollar iron and uranium mines have been proposed, and trillions of cubic metres of natural gas and major oil reserves lie offshore.
At the same time, the greenhouse effect is literally changing Nunavut’s landscape as sea ice melts, glaciers dwindle and southern plant and animal species follow warming temperatures north.
‘Founding father’
John Amagoalik is often called a “founding father” of Nunavut, though he doesn’t seem happy when he’s asked about it. Seated in his small office in the capital Iqaluit with a population 8,000, he explained the origins of Nunavut.
“We were fearing a government that had assimilation policies, that was trying to wipe out Aboriginal people in Canada,” Amagoalik told Al Jazeera. “We wanted to have more control over our lives … Our language and culture were in jeopardy as we saw it.”
Before the 1950s, Inuit were self-sufficient. They survived in the extreme arctic climate for thousands of years with a culture based on hunting, cooperation, sophisticated technology, and close observation of the land, sea and ice. For centuries, Canadian officials could not survive in the north without Inuit help.
|Fifty percent of people in Nunavut live in poverty [Dru Oja Jay]|
But in the post-World War II expansion, the Canada government exerted itself. Children were taken from parents and placed in residential schools, where they were punished for speaking Inuktitut and often physically and sexually abused. Families were misled or coerced into permanent settlements. Dog teams, the main means of travel in the winter, were slaughtered by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
The results were devastating, but Inuit have remained resilient and innovative.
By the 1960s, oil-and-gas exploration was booming in the Arctic. Amagoalik recalled “planes taking off and landing every few minutes” in the remote community of Resolute Bay.
Some Inuit leaders realised that by invoking their constitutionally enshrined rights to the land, they might be able to influence these operations. This leverage forced the Canadian government to the negotiating table, and 20 years of dialogue ensued.
Historic agreement
When the two parties signed the Nunavut Land Claim Agreement on July 9, 1993, the Canadian government got – and the Inuit gave up their rights to – about 25 percent of its total landmass. In return, Canada was obliged to provide Inuit of Nunavut with long-term support for self-government, education, job training, and to consult them on the use of Arctic lands.
|Inuit leader John Amagoalik at his office in Iqaluit [Dru Oja Jay]|
Nunavut has its own government today, but it is dominated by Qallunaat, non-Inuit, many of whom have little interest in their priorities or speaking their language.
Employing non-Inuit costs the government an estimated $137m per year in direct costs such as transportation and housing. With most of that money being spent outside of Nunavut, the long-term impacts on the economy are incalculable. By contrast, Canada has spent only $40m implementing the Inuit employment requirements of the agreement in the last 20 years.
In 2006, Nunavut Tunngavik Inc (NTI), the governing body for Inuit in Nunavut, filed a $1bn lawsuit against the government of Canada, alleging it failed to follow through with its obligations under the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement. The lawsuit is still before the courts.
“There are a number of areas that continue to be areas of concern for NTI,” said its CEO James Arreak at his office. “Canada has not come to the table in the same manner that the Inuit have. Canada got everything it wanted as soon as it signed the Land Claim agreement. Inuit are still waiting.”
Indian and Northern Affairs Canada, the agency in charge of implementation of the Nunavut Land Claim, did not return requests for comment by publication time.
A new partner?
As Inuit look for new sources of leverage, some are looking beyond the windowless courtrooms of Ottawa, where the lawsuit is likely to spend several more years.
Kowesa Etitiq is among those who believe Nunavut should look beyond the Land Claim, including making a new deal with a nation other than Canada.
“If Canada isn’t living up to the agreement, we should have the opportunity to renegotiate … We shouldn’t limit ourselves to talking to Canada, either. All the options should be considered,” Etitiq said.
|Climate change is affecting Canada’s arctic [Dru Oja Jay]|
Inuit leaders are unlikely to formally negotiate with Russia or China anytime soon, but international leverage might be the best way to put pressure on the Canadian government.
Countries are jockeying for influence over vast natural gas deposits under the Arctic ocean. Climate change is also opening up international shipping lanes that could cut thousands of kilometres off of routes from Asia to Europe.
“Canada hasn’t done much in the way of bringing the Inuit into the fold,” said Etitiq. “Nunavut will get infrastructure when it can pay for herself.”
Madeleine Redfern, a former mayor of Iqaluit, said in Greenland Inuit there have much more autonomy, and their situation could be a model to follow.
“I think we’re going to see an increase in awareness among Canadian Inuit of the value of independence,” Redfern said by phone from her home in Iqaluit. “Otherwise, we might see ourselves becoming like the Métis in [the Canadian province of] Manitoba, which was created with the idea of Métis nationhood, and there’s little or no evidence of that now.”
Others are looking for ways to build Inuit strength through cultural revitalisation.
Laakkuluk Williamson Bathory was one of the organisers of Idle No More, the indigenous social movement that swept across Canada last December. She said demonstrations in Iqaluit showed that Inuit had “had enough of living under colonial institutions”.
“People have to keep expressing that upwelling of will,” Bathory told Al Jazeera. “Finding ways of expressing oneself creatively is fundamental, and food sharing is a big part of both physical and mental health … It’s about taking cultural skills like hunting and cooperation and using those to create things like daycares, youth organisations and political parties.” .

cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/08/weather/canada-ice-shelf-collapse-milne-manhattan/index.html ,"This large sheet of ice then drifted into the Arctic Sea, further breaking into two large chunks. This entire calving event -- the scientific term for the breaking of ice chunks off glaciers -- was captured by the Copernicus Sentinel satellite.
The piece that broke off was around 80 square kilometers -- larger than the 60-square-kilometer Manhattan.
""Above-normal air temperatures, offshore winds and open water in front of the ice shelf are all part of the recipe for ice shelf break up,"" according to the Canadian Ice Service.
""Due to the presence of pre-existing fractures in the remaining Milne Ice Shelf, there is a potential for further destabilization,"" the Water and Ice Research Laboratory (WIRL) said in a press release
on August 7. The ice shelf is still unstable and further ice breaks are possible in the coming days and weeks, WIRL warned.
A research site on the ice shelf was razed during this collapse.
""It is lucky that we were not on the ice shelf when this happened, our camp area and instruments were all destroyed in this event,"" said Derek Mueller, professor in the Department of Geography and Environmental Studies at Carleton University in a blog post
on August 2.
Mueller and his team have visited Milne Ice Shelf numerous times, but the trip this year was canceled due to the coronavirus pandemic.
The last known epishelf lake in the Arctic could be gone because of the ice shelf break. An epishelf lake
is a body of freshwater trapped by an ice shelf that floats on top of ocean water.
When the Milne Ice Shelf collapsed, it potentially sent once-contained freshwater into the salty waters of the Arctic Ocean. Researchers are unsure about the extent of this damage ""as this depends on the integrity of the remaining part of the Milne Ice Self.""
Ice shelves like these can help limit global sea level rise by acting like a dam, slowing the flow of melting ice and water into the oceans. These large calving events can also create hazards for the shipping industry by creating essentially large icebergs floating across the northern oceans.
The Arctic has continued to warm far more rapidly than any other region across the world as arctic heatwaves
continuously impact the region. Temperatures across the Arctic continued to rise in July this year across Canada and Siberia, where large wildfires continue to burn
.
""Globally, it was the third warmest July in this data record, behind 2016 and 2019,"" Copernicus ECMWF said in their monthly climate bulletin
.
This is not the first time this year that the Canadian Arctic has lost significant ice features.

theguardian,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/05/canada-nunavut-aaron-gibbons-mauled-polar-bear-kids ,"A father in the northern Canadian territory of Nunavut is being hailed as a hero after he died protecting his three young children from a polar bear attack.
Aaron Gibbons, 31, was at a popular fishing and hunting spot near the hamlet of Arviat, on the western shores of Hudson Bay, on Tuesday when the bear appeared, according to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Gibbons was unarmed at the time of the attack.
He was on a small island enjoying a day out with his children, Gordy Kidlapik, Gibbons’ uncle, told the Winnipeg Free Press.
“The bear started to stalk or charge one of his children,” he said. “He told his children to run back to the boat and put himself between his children and the bear.”
His school-age children made it safely to the boat and called for help on the CB radio. Kidlapik was among those who heard the call, describing it as “heartbreaking”.
Police said Gibbons was pronounced dead at the scene. “He died a hero,” said Kidlapik.
The bear was shot and killed by other adults who were nearby.
The attack left Arviat, a small hamlet that is home to some 2,600 people, reeling. “It’s just really incredibly sad,” a local lawmaker, John Main, told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC). “We’re a small community and when something like this happens, it affects the whole community.”
Attacks by polar bears are rare; the last polar bear mauling in the region is believed to have happened 18 years ago in Rankin Inlet, about 200km north of Arviat.
Nunavut’s department of environment said conservation officers were investigating the circumstances of the attack to determine whether factors such as the bear’s age or health played a role in the attack.
Arviat is located within the range of the Western Hudson Bay polar bear population, which numbers around 840 bears, according to 2016 estimates.
In recent years, local hunters and elders in the community have reported a spike in sightings of polar bears around the community and noted that they seem to be less afraid of humans.
The World Wildlife Fund, which in 2010 partnered with Arviat to launch a program to monitor the perimeter of the community from September to December, has linked the increase to climate change.
Sea ice is taking longer to form each autumn, meaning bears are spending more time on the coastline, Paul Crowley, director of the organisation’s arctic program, told the CBC in 2016. “It’s partially because the climate is changing and partly because of attractants in the communities like the dumps.”
On Wednesday, Kidlapik, Gibbons’ uncle, floated his own theory, pointing to polar bear tours based in Churchill, Manitoba – about 250km south of Arviat – for acclimatising the bears to the presence of humans.
“You’ll see pictures of tourists touching a bear through the fence,” he said, while other outfitters offered walking tours near the bears.
The bears then migrated from Manitoba, where the tours are based, towards northern communities like Arviat, he said.
He speculated that the tours could be a factor in explaining the bears’ shifting behaviour, noting that 10 or 15 years ago, they would flee at the sound of an all-terrain vehicle or snowmobile.
“Today, bears are not doing that. They hang around. They won’t run away. They’ll go on the trail beside you,” he said. “Bears are losing whatever fear they have of humans.”
When asked about any potential link between polar bear tours and the attack, Nunavut’s department of environment declined to comment. . ",True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False
thewalrus,https://thewalrus.ca/nunavut-u/ ,"This fall, 1.7 million students will head to class at one of Canada’s ninety-seven universities. None of them will sit at a desk north of 60°, because we are the only circumpolar country without an Arctic university.
Southerners have been calling for such a school for decades. In 1977, not long after permanent communities were established in the Far North, the Science Council of Canada argued that the “most immediate value of a University of the North would be to provide a focus for the development of northern research activities specifically designed to solve northern problems.” More recently, John Ralston Saul wrote in his 2008 bestseller, A Fair Country, “An arctic university would be the single-most eloquent statement we could make about Canada as a place in the North.”
So far, though, we’ve done a D-minus job of setting one up. In 2001, Canada helped to spearhead the University of the Arctic, a global network of 170 institutions committed to circumpolar education and research. A handful of our schools joined, including Vancouver Island University and the University of Manitoba. Then, in 2011, Ottawa slashed federal funding and cannibalized our prominent role in the co-operative, now based in Finland. Colleges and other training programs exist throughout the North, including Yukon College, out of Whitehorse; Aurora College and the Academy of Learning College, in Northwest Territories; and Nunavut Arctic College, with campuses spread across the territory. But if you’re a northerner who wants to pursue, say, a bachelor’s in engineering or a master’s in geography, you have to head south.
This is one reason that northerners, and especially Indigenous peoples, trail the rest of the country in post-secondary education in general, and advanced degrees in particular. Yukon does best: 54 percent of the population has earned some sort of credential. However, much of that figure reflects the presence of southerners who move to the territory for resource jobs, then leave again. In Russia, by contrast, up to 65 percent of the circumpolar population has pursued advanced training at one of the country’s twenty-five Arctic universities.
Retention tends to be lower among Native students across North America—another barrier to education. Geographic proximity goes hand in hand with graduation rates, but schools are often far from Aboriginal communities. Students can feel isolated and unmoored, and they often cannot afford the time or the cost of travelling back home for long weekends and holidays. This is true even in Alaska, which has two Arctic campuses. The state system retains 75 percent of new students, more than a quarter of whom graduate within six years. Among Aboriginal students in Alaska, however, retention is 59 percent; a mere 12 percent end up graduating.
The North requires a distinct academic model, one that complements peer-reviewed research with traditional knowledge of ice floes, polar bear populations, and cloudberries. That type of expertise won’t land you a teaching position (let alone tenure) at the University of Toronto, but it could in an Arctic setting.
Kirt Ejesiak is among the most prominent voices calling for a locally run university. “A southern school that sets something up here—that’d be a notch in their belt,” he told me over lunch in Iqaluit. “But we’re tired of folks speaking on our behalf. We have our own experts, thank you very much.” At the same time, it’s not enough to simply rebrand an existing institution. Real vision is required: “We can do better than slap a new sign outside an existing college system and say it’s a university now. The biggest challenge is the politics.”
One of the first Inuit graduates of Harvard University, Ejesiak served on an organizing committee that published a report in May recommending that a university be founded in Iqaluit within the next two years. Initially, it would host eight programs: Inuit studies, fine arts, linguistics, political science, education, health, natural science, and law. While it would primarily serve students from across the four Inuit regions in Canada, it would be inclusive of Inuit from around the world, as well as all Canadians. In early June, Nellie Kusugak, then deputy commissioner of Nunavut, announced a feasibility study for such an institution, which may lead the territorial government to grant the necessary charter.
Skeptics are quick to point out the challenges of establishing a university in the North. Construction and infrastructure costs would be up to double the same budgets for southern institutions. There is little broadband connectivity. There are no academic libraries. The communities are not vibrant enough to attract and retain top talent. The region suffers from substandard primary education and considerable high school dropout rates. Even if graduation rates do improve, the population is simply too small to sustain a proper university.
But these challenges can be overcome. “Education requires push and pull,” Saul wrote in A Fair Country. “You must push on from kindergarten up, while you pull from the most advanced university levels.” Small populations support Arctic campuses elsewhere. Nuuk, the capital of Greenland, has one. The University of Oulu in Finland has over 15,000 students, counts presidents among its alumni, and is considered one of the best schools in Europe. And let’s not forget the humble beginnings of our oldest institution of higher education, Laval University in Quebec City, which was founded in 1663 when the European population of New France was just over 3,000.
You create a Laval or a Harvard not because the local population is big enough to support it, but because scholarship thrives on new perspectives and cross-pollination. More than anything, that is why Canadians should care about an Arctic university. An atmospheric chemist living and working in Nunavut year-round is bound to have a different understanding of climate change than one who does the occasional stint at the Canadian High Arctic Research Station. A political scientist based in the territories adds to our understanding of federalism. A sociologist working with non-traditional students who are overwhelmingly female—as would be typical in Iqaluit—contributes to demography. A primary teacher trained in the North will be a better educator in the North—and perhaps a better educator in the South, too.
So far, Ottawa has stayed quiet on the subject, but the government should throw every bit of its financial and symbolic weight behind a bricks-and-mortar Arctic university. Empowering students, scholars, elders, and the general public to study north of 60° would represent true Arctic sovereignty—much more so than annual photo ops of the prime minister posing with the Canadian Rangers—and it would further galvanize a creative intellectual community.
“A university can be a force of inspiration for our people,” Ejesiak said. It can also make us a smarter, better country.

globalnews,https://globalnews.ca/news/5499198/nunavut-heat-wave-environment-canada/ ,"Weather watchers are focused on the world’s most northerly community which has been in the middle of a record-breaking heat wave.
“It’s really quite spectacular,” said David Phillips, Environment Canada’s chief climatologist. “This is unprecedented.”
The weather agency confirmed that Canadian Forces Station Alert hit a record of 21 C on Sunday. On Monday, the military listening post on the top of Ellesmere Island had reached 20 C by noon and inched slightly higher later in the day.
Alert was warmer both days than Victoria, B.C., a Canadian go-to for balmy climes.
The average July high for Alert is 7 C. Phillips said that means the heat wave at the top of the world is the equivalent of Toronto registering a daytime high of 42 C.
“It’s nothing that you would have ever seen.”
WATCH: How will climate change affect Canada?
A military spokesman said nobody at the high-security station, which monitors electronic signals and communications, was available to say if soldiers had swapped parkas for flip-flops.
Phillips said it’s the latest anomaly in what’s been a long, hot summer across the Arctic.
Global News’ chief meteorologist, Anthony Farnell, said the rise in temperatures is being seen across Nunavut and isn’t exclusive to Alert.
“Seven stations across Nunavut, the temperature is running about 1 C above average this July,” he said.
Farnell explained that while the temperature in Nunavut has reached above 19 C several times in the last decade, this is the first time with temperatures above 20 on back to back days.
He said a large area of high pressure over northern Greenland is helping funnel up warm air from the US and southern Canada.
Iqaluit, Nunavut, saw the mercury rise to 23.5 C on July 9 – the highest ever for that day. Alaska had its second-warmest June on record.
Records have been falling – not by fractions, but by large margins.
“That’s what we’re seeing more often,” Phillips said.
“It’s not just half a degree or a 10th of a millimetre. It’s like hitting a ball out of the ballpark. It is so different than what the previous record was.”
More is to come, he predicted.
“Our models for the rest of the summer are saying, ‘Get used to it.'”
WATCH: Permafrost melting faster than scientists can study it
In Alert’s case, the source of the Arctic beach weather is a large current of air that somehow found its way north from the U.S. southeast, Phillips said.
It could be related to changes in the jet stream, a fast-moving high-altitude river of air that moves west to east. That current has slowed in recent years and has become more unstable, sometimes looping much farther north or south than normal.
Many scientists believe the changes are at least partly the result of melting sea ice.
“It’s almost as if you’re seeing these extremes more often because of the jet stream that has a different look and a different pattern,” Phillips said. “That’s what we saw when we had those 20-degree temperatures in Iqaluit.”
It’s part of a pattern, he said. He’s cautious about attributing specific events to any one cause, but not about naming one of the main drivers.
“With temperatures you’ve never seen before, you can’t dismiss it as not having a climate change component.” . ",True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False

Nunavut, Canada's largest and northernmost territory, is grappling with widespread food insecurity in the age of climate change. Inuit who live in the north traditionally depended on subsistence hunting of caribou, seal, fish, and other wild game—which are now being replaced with a wide variety of foods that are imported from the south. These goods are hugely expensive because of the labor and cost involved in shipping to Arctic regions. ""People are hungry,"" says Nunavut resident Leesee Papatsie in this documentary by the filmmaker Mark Andrew Boyer. ""We want the people of Nunavut to stand up, to say something, [and] for the Inuit to be more self-reliant.""

Birds of Nunavut
Mixed Media Product includes both the hardcover 2-volume set and the PDF.
Nunavut is a land of islands, encompassing some of the most remote places on Earth. It is also home to some of the world’s most fascinating bird species. The windswept tundra, rocky shorelines, and icy waters of this thinly populated land are integral to the survival of numerous breeding and non-breeding birds, including the colourful King Eider, the stately Snowy Owl, the spritely Snow Bunting, and the globe-spanning Northern Wheatear.
Birds of Nunavut is the first complete survey of every species known to occur in the territory. Co-written by a team of eighteen experts who have conducted a combined total of 300 seasons of fieldwork in Nunavut, they document 295 species of birds (of which 145 are known to breed there), presenting a wealth of information on identification, distribution, ecology, behaviour, and conservation. Lavishly illustrated with over 800 colour photographs (showing plumages, nests, eggs, and young for most breeding species) and 145 range maps, it is a visually stunning reference work on the birds that live in and visit Nunavut.
Volume 1 of this two-volume set contains species accounts for the nonpasserine birds of Nunavut (from Ducks, Geese, and Swans to Falcons). It also provides an overview of Nunavut’s geography and ecology, bird conservation concerns, and the history of the study of birds in the territory. Volume 2 provides species accounts for the passerine birds of Nunavut (from Tyrant Flycatchers to Cardinals). It also contains four appendices (including a species checklist) and the references and index for both volumes.
This book is a must-have for bird enthusiasts of all sorts, including birders (both serious and armchair), ornithologists, researchers, naturalists, resource managers, and tourists.
This two-volume set offers a state-of-the-knowledge survey of the birds of Nunavut, particularly of those species that breed there. Chapters on the geography, history, ecology, and environments of Nunavut provide comprehensive context for the bird descriptions. The Arctic is changing rapidly and this beautifully illustrated book will be the standard reference against which all new knowledge will be measured.
Birds of Nunavut will open the eyes of people who may never enjoy the Arctic in person. People everywhere should care about the Arctic and efforts made to protect its rich diversity. I especially enjoy the emphasis on birds in this book not only because I am a life-long birder but also because birds are literally the canaries in the coal mine. Preserving their habitat relates directly to preserving ourselves.
Birds of Nunavut provides a much-needed assessment of the status of birds in this vast region. At this crucial juncture of our history, when we have started to realize the disproportionate impacts of climate change on the northernmost parts of the planet, understanding the makeup of its avifauna is ever more important and will help us understand better how it is changing, and perhaps, hopefully, help preserve it.
Birds of Nunavut provides a comprehensive baseline of avian occurrences, phenology, and population trends. It affords a solid framework for accelerating research and new knowledge as ongoing climate modification, industrial activity, and national sovereignty issues intensify.
Birds of Nunavut is an essential addition to the library of all those seriously interested in the Arctic. Much more than a field guide, it contains highly readable accounts of the history, geography, and ecology of the region, as well as comprehensive field accounts of all species.

In the coming years, climate change is expected to affect the Arctic in many ways. We are already seeing its impact on birds, including changing prey species for Southern Arctic seabirds; ‘shrubification’ of former tundra that affects nesting waterfowl and sea ducks; and increasing storm events that put migrating shorebirds at risk. Birds of Nunavut provides a comprehensive snapshot of the current knowledge about Nunavut’s birds by which to calibrate future change.

There was no getting into remote Auyuittuq National Park when I landed in Pangnirtung in that awkward stage of early winter, when it’s cold and dark most days and the sea and river ice hasn't yet fully frozen so it isn't safe to boat or snowmobile.
Instead, I headed to the park’s visitor centre to learn more about the Baffin Island community that lives in a fjord on Cumberland Sound and that’s famously near Mount Asgard where the opening ski and parachute scene of The Spy Who Loved Me was shot. The twin-peaked mountain — with flat topped, cylindrical rock towers separated by a “saddle” — is 30 kilometres (19 miles) away in the national park.
It was early December in Nunavut and the inukshuk — a structure made of stones piled on top of each other usually to mark important places — in the foyer of the weathered, pale green visitor centre was draped in festive garlands and topped with a Santa hat. A few steps away was a dramatic diorama with a taxidermied polar bear wearing a sparkly green garland and preparing to feast on a seal on real rock and sand in front of a painted ocean.
Parks Canada interpretation officer Matthew Nakashuk was on hand to share his enthusiasm for Pang and gently explain why day trips to Auyuittuq were out of the question. He consoled me with a look at some of the cultural, historical and archaeological artifacts that are showcased at Canada’s national parks and historic sites.
Interpretive displays in English, French and Inuktitut revealed that Baffin Island and Greenland were once connected but continental drift separated them amid volcanic activity that created massive lava flows. Ice didn’t build up on the nearby Penny Ice Cap and override mountain peaks during the Ice Age like it did elsewhere, and outlet glaciers let accumulating ice flow between mountains into lower valleys. That’s how Mount Asgard, Thor Peak and other local mountains kept their unusual shapes.
Almost all the soil here is permanently frozen, except for a thin surface layer that melts in summer and lets plants grow to battle strong Arctic winds blowing sand and snow crystals. “The survivors are tough, well-adapted life-forms,” read a sign beside photos of defiantly golden Arctic poppy and fuzzy Arctic willows.
A mural dominated the walls of the polar bear room, showing what I believe were those same yellow poppies in a summer scene with an Inuk woman kneeling by a mountain river in front of a skin tent, butterfly, caribou, geese, wolves and a Rock ptarmigan. The mural segued into a winter scene showing an Inuk hunter poised with a harpoon over fish and other marine life in front of an igloo and sled dog team, northern lights, polar bears and an Arctic fox.
On other walls there was a seal skin stretched out on a drying rack and, naturally, massive maps detailing the national park.
Auyuittuq (pronounced ow-you-we-took) is Inuktitut for “Land That Never Melts.” With craggy mountains and granite cliffs, it’s the most accessible of the territory’s five national parks and the most popular with hikers, skiers, climbers and backpackers. Outfitters with snowmobiles, dog teams or boats also lead day trips. Orientation sessions are mandatory before entering the park and so is de-registering at the end of a backcountry trip. Polar bears, avalanches, severe winds, flooding and rockfall are just some of the threats, and emergency shelters and outhouses are the only maintained services in the wilderness park.
National park visitor centres are often overlooked. They’re more than just a place to pay park access fees and buy fishing licenses, trail maps, books and souvenirs. It was at this one in Pang where I learned that had it been April, with its frozen sea and rivers and long hours of daylight, Parks Canada might have led me on a day-long boat and hiking trip to Ulu Peak or on an Arctic Circle snowmobile outing.
“These are just a teaser to get into the park,” admitted Nakashuk. “The scenery gets more dramatic as you get in deeper.” Ninety-eight per cent of visitors hire an outfitter out of Pangnirtung or the island community of Qikiqtarjuag. Only two per cent of people devote the four extra days needed to hike or ski in and out of the park, something that is discouraged. Those who camp typically stay three to five days.
Auyuittuq has a polar marine climate and its spring ski, snowmobile and snowshoe season usually runs mid-March until early May. The park becomes inaccessible when the sea ice breaks up in June and July. Hiking and climbing season, with access by boats on the incoming or high tide, typically runs late July through September.
While adventurous visitors have just begun to explore Auyuittuq in the last century, the Inuit and their ancestors have been using the region for thousands of years and maintain unrestricted access.
“In order to survive from the land, you have to protect it,” declares Mariano Aupilaarjuk — presumably a revered elder — in a display about the Fork Beard Glacier and the impact of climate change. “The land is so important for us to survive and live on; that’s why we treat it as part of ourselves.”
A circular chart showcases the Inuit year’s eight seasons, which includes season of the seal pups, season of the berries and season of the denning polar bear. It details how caribou, seal and Arctic char are harvested year-round, and what can be hunted, fished and harvested in other months.
Another display poetically describes Auyuittuq as “a land of ice, a dozen fjords, a hundred glaciers, an ice cap bigger than Prince Edward Island.”
The Inuit living in the Cumberland Sound had little contact with settlers until American and Scottish whalers arrived in the 1820s to hunt bowhead whales. People began to settle in Pang (“Place of the Bull Caribou”) in the 1950s, and the gateway community of 1,600 is now 85 per cent Inuit. It sees several hundred visitors a year, most from expedition cruise ships who don’t stay the night.
The visitor centre’s staff meeting room is also open to explore, and signage details how the human history of Auyuittuq spans 4,000 years and how archaeological inventories of the park are ongoing. It delves into the Thule people, the ancestors of today’s Inuit who came here from Alaska as expert whalers with metal and stone tools as well as important technology for kayaks, dogsleds and hunting land and sea mammals.
This room has sea views and showcases soapstone sculptures by Inuit artists such as Jaco Ishulutak and Manasa Evic, as well as an intriguing traditional bone game called Inugaq that revolves around competing to create families, dog teams, sleds and igloos.
For such a small visitor centre, this one punches above its weight in showcasing the park and Inuit culture. After my visit, I puttered around Pang, visiting the commercial turbot fishery plant, two grocery stores with distressingly high prices, the Angmarlik Visitor Centre to learn more about the Thule and modern Inuit, the Uqqurmiut Centre for Arts & Crafts to admire the famous tapestries and buy crocheted Pang hats, and the Hudson’s Bay Co. blubber station that was once used to process the fat and hides of whales and seals. I stuck close to town, on high alert for polar bears.
Mount Asgard and Auyuittuq National Park might have been too far away to even catch a glimpse of, but I flew away from the stunning hamlet dubbed ""the Switzerland of the Arctic"" with a vivid mental picture of them both and an impatience to return soon — in the appropriate season.

Aerial drone footage of bowhead whales in Canada's Arctic has revealed that the large mammals molt and use rocks to rub off dead skin.
The footage provides one answer to the mystery of why whales return to Cumberland Sound, Nunavut, every summer, and helps explain some unusual behavior that has been noted historically by Inuit and commercial whalers living and working in the area.
""This was an incidental observation,"" said Sarah Fortune, a PhD student at UBC's Institute for the Oceans and Fisheries and lead author of a new study based on the findings. ""We were there to document their prey and feeding behavior, but we noticed some strange behavior near the shore.""
Fortune and her colleagues—William Koski, a whale biologist with LGL Limited, and local Inuit hunters and fishers from Pangnirtung - watched from a boat as the whales turned on their sides and waved their flippers and tails in the air. It was clear the whales weren't there just to feed.
When the researchers sent drones up to record the animals from above, they saw large boulders underwater and realized that the whales were rubbing against rocks to remove dead skin.
""We now know that Cumberland Sound serves as a habitat for feeding and molting,"" said Fortune. ""Very little is known about molting in any of the large whale species.""
The warmer coastal waters of summer might help facilitate molting, Fortune says. Ocean temperatures are expected to rise, and the change could have implications for the timing, duration and energy needed for molting, as well as the whales' diets.
As oceans change, relatively large-bodied, fatty Arctic crustaceans known as zooplankton the preferred prey of bowhead whales could move to new habitats further north while smaller-bodied, temperate species that are lower in energy are likely to dominate the waters. Scientists don't know how whales will adapt to the changing environment.
Fortune hopes to conduct further studies to determine whether bowhead whales molt primarily during summer months, and throughout their range.
Bowhead whales are the longest-living marine mammals on the planet, with lifespans up to 200 years. . ",True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False

How climate change is disrupting the Inuit of Clyde River
By Bryan Walsh |Photographs by CAMILLA ANDERSEN
Most of us—even those who care deeply about the issue—are insulated from climate change. Sometimes literally, living and working and traveling in air-conditioned bubbles, but in a deeper way as well. For the fortunate, the global economy cushions the symptoms of global warming—the shift in growing seasons, the melting Arctic ice, the spread of disease. The change in climate is still something more to be read about than experienced. It is our future, but not yet our livelihood, that is on the line.

Not so for the Inuit people of Clyde River. The tiny community of about 1,000 is located in the far north of the Canadian territory of Nunavut, just inside the Arctic Circle. Until the middle of the last century, the Inuit of Nunavut mostly lived as nomadic hunters, chasing game in tune with the passage of the seasons.
That way of life mostly ended by the 1960s, when the Canadian government moved the Inuit into permanent settlements, and hunting became more difficult. And now the land itself is changing in unrecognizable ways, with the Arctic now warming at least twice as fast as the rest of the globe. The polar sea ice that is the backbone of the local environment has melted to record lows over the last couple of years. “Climate change is threatening the Inuit way of life even further,” says Camilla Andersen, a Norwegian documentary photographer.
Polar bear pelts hang out to dry. In the 1960s, the Canadian government encouraged the traditionally nomadic Inuit to move into subsidized housing.

Her husband, Jerry (second from left) is the former mayor of Clyde River, and one of the most vocal proponents of protecting indigenous ways of life in the community.
Andersen has seen the change with her own eyes. Last year she traveled to Clyde River to document how climate change was affecting the Inuit way of life. To get there, Andersen essentially had to travel due west—she notes that where she is from in northern Norway is at about the same latitude as Clyde River.
The Inuit in Clyde River and elsewhere in Nunavut often struggle to get enough to eat, even though they live in one of the richest nations in the world. Clyde River, which sits on the northeastern coast of Baffin Island, is isolated even by the standards of Nunavut, largely accessible only by plane and snowmobile. Food has to be imported, and costs three times what it does on average elsewhere in the country. And that isolation and privation has taken a tremendous toll on the people of Clyde River, especially the youngest—suicide rates in Nunavut are 10 times higher than in Canada as a whole. “Inuit youths feel like they are lost between two cultures,” says Andersen. “They don’t have enough knowledge to sustain themselves the traditional way, and at the same time, they can’t afford to live a normal life.”
Clyde River has a population of around 1,000 people.

Andersen’s photographs capture the bleakness and isolation of the landscape around Clyde River—and its stark beauty as well. Seen from above, the deep white valleys carved out by glaciers and ice sheet jag through the brown land, itself veined by October snow. In another image, a massive and weathered white iceberg rises from the sea, even as the warming water eats away at its base. Portraits capture community members in their homes, surrounded by the debris of their lives.

But Andersen’s project is called “Hunting for Hope” for a reason. In Clyde River, community organizations were at work providing collective support for townspeople who were struggling. Though the melting ice has made the hunt more difficult, elders still take young family members to hunt seals and polar bears. Andersen went along for a hunt, and her portrait of Nanasi Illauq captures the young man against a slate gray Arctic sky, rifle cocked. “By bringing hunting back and strengthening the traditions, people can feel they are worth something while learning how to sustain themselves,” says Andersen. “I do believe this is important, but it doesn’t mean it’s for everyone.”
Indeed, Andersen shows polar bear skins tinged in blood draped over kitchen tables and wooden decks. But only a handful of polar bear permits are given out each fall, and they’re only good for 48 hours. The hunts are far from the biggest threat facing the polar bears, which are at much greater danger from the loss of their sea ice habitat.

Locals say that sea ice used to form in September. Now, it forms in October, or as late as November.
With President Donald Trump withdrawing the U.S. last month from the Paris climate agreement, efforts to reduce carbon emissions and the pace of warming have slackened. Even according to the most optimistic forecasts, the environment around Clyde River and the rest of Nunavut will continue to change beneath the feet of the people who have lived there for hundreds of years.
For now, the hunt will still go on. Nanasi remembers when he caught his first seal at the age of 12: “I was the proudest boy in the world.” Hunting, he says, gives him peace because it permits him “to be alone, where there’s nobody around to make me mad or make me depressed.” It helps him forget, for a time, his two older brothers who both died by suicide. They were each 28 years old when they took their own lives. Nanasi is 26.

Canadian Inuit have a territory of their own, but self-government is not without its challenges
by Susan Hyde
Inuit means ""the people who are alive at this time"" in Inuktitut. Eskimo, a Cree Indian word meaning ""eaters of raw meat,"" is considered derogatory and is no longer used in Nunavut.

On April 1, 1999, Nunavut separated from the Northwest Territories to become the newest Canadian territory. The creation of Nunavut was the outcome of the largest aboriginal land claims agreement between the Canadian government and the native Inuit people.
The Inuit, who make up 83% of Nunavut's 24,730 residents, will be one of the first indigenous peoples in the Americas to achieve self-government. Nunavut means ""our land"" in Inuktitut, the Inuit language.
Where is Nunavut?
Nunavut is bordered by Baffin Bay and the Labrador Sea to the east, Manitoba and Saskatchewan to the south, and the Northwest Territories on the west. Covering 777,000 square miles (almost 20% of Canada) Nunavut is larger than Alaska. Nunavut contains three regionsâKitikmeot, Kilvalliq (Keewatin) and Qikiqtani (formerly Baffin)âand 28 communities.
Most of the area is frozen and snow-covered for more than half the year. The land is primarily tundra. Although there are rich deposits of copper, lead, silver, and zinc, the lack of paved roads and an infrastructure, as well as the harsh climate, make the development of these resources difficult.
Iqaluit (formerly known as Frobisher Bay), the new capital and largest city (population 4,200) is currently experiencing a building boom as it prepares or the new government. Grise Ford, the northernmost city, (population less than 150) lies north of the Arctic Circle. Temperatures range from -40 degrees F in the winter to 5 degrees F in the summer. The population density is 0.01 persons per square kilometer.
The Nunavut People
Inuit means ""the people who are alive at this time"" in Inuktitut and refers to the people of ""Eskimoid"" ancestry inhabiting northern Canada. The term Eskimo, a Cree Indian work meaning ""eaters of raw meat,"" is considered derogatory and is no longer used in Nunavut.
The Inuit lived in the Nunavut region for thousands of years before the first European explorers arrived searching for whales and a Northwest Passage.
Once a nomadic people who followed the caribou, seals, and fish for food, most Inuit now live in small communities that depend on trapping and mining for their livelihood. There are three official languages, Inuktitut, English, and French. Educational achievement is low: in 1996, 26% had attended or graduated from high school, 32% attended trade school, and about 11% had attended or graduated from university. Unemployment is high, at 15.3%.
Although the Nunavut government faces many challenges with high unemployment, low educational levels and little infrastructure, the Nunavut land claims settlement, one of the most comprehensive and innovative land claims between an aborigine group and a state, gives the Inuit control over their economic, political, and cultural future.
Creation of the New Territory
The discovery of oil in the northern regions of Canada during the 1960s and 1970s stimulated aboriginal groups to bring several land claims against the Alaskan and Canadian governments.
For the politically organized Tungavik Federation of Nunavut, 13 years of intense negotiation led to the 1992 Land Claims Agreement, enacted in 1993. As part of the agreement, the Inuit insisted on the creation of a new territory. There was little progress until the Inuit forced the government to put the question on a plebiscite. 53% of the voting public favored the division.
With the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement, the Inuit gain title to 136,000 square miles of land plus $1.1 billion dollars in compensation, a share of mineral, oil, and gas development, the right to participate in decisions regarding the land and water resources, and rights to harvest wildlife on their lands.

The effectiveness of the current food policy is questioned by increasing rates of food insecurity in the territory.
Complex interactions between availability of and access to store and traditional foods will determine policy effectiveness, in ways not yet fully understood.
Cross-cutting systemic action rooted in Inuit values and knowledge must be central to policies aimed at strengthening food systems.
Access to adequate food is a major challenge for communities across the Inuit Nunangat.1 In Nunavut, food insecurity has been identified to be at crisis level, with 46.8% of households categorized as food insecure in the most recent Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) in 2014.2 Such a high rate of food insecurity documented in a high-income nation, with all its related health and societal implications, is concerning.1 As such, food security has become a political and public priority in Nunavut, and in 2011 the federal government launched the Nutrition North Canada program to improve the affordability and accessibility of perishable, nutritious store foods. Nutrition North Canada has been controversial since its inception, and now a linked research paper by Fafard St-Germain and colleagues3 provides evidence that rates of food insecurity in the territory have actually increased by 13.2 percentage points since the program’s launch.
The authors of the linked study use a novel design to examine CCHS data from before (2007–2010) and after (2014–2016) the implementation of Nutrition North Canada. Finding that reported food insecurity has increased in remote communities in Nunavut, they question the effectiveness of Nutrition North Canada. However, this policy forms part of a whole suite of actions by government, civil society and communities targeted at strengthening food systems.4 The degree of contribution of Nutrition North Canada to increased food insecurity needs further investigation.
Policy evaluation is notoriously difficult. Standard food surveys such as the one used in the CCHS can be misleading in the absence of qualitative research to consider how Inuit access both store foods and traditional foods. Standardized surveys have been critiqued for lacking cultural appropriateness, and they provide only a snapshot on the state of food systems at a particular point in time.5,6 The authors of the linked research acknowledge some of these limitations, but in the absence of a more comprehensive suite of evaluation methods, the work paints only half a picture.
Furthermore, while Fafard St-Germain and colleagues controlled for several socioeconomic and sociodemographic characteristics in their study, several other important confounders were not considered. This raises the question of the counterfactual: even without Nutrition North Canada, would rates of food insecurity have increased? Other lines of evidence suggest they might have.
First, social changes rooted in the impacts of colonialism and its legacy continue to affect Inuit food systems in diverse ways. Reduced participation in harvesting among younger generations and diminished intergenerational transfer of traditional ecological knowledge have been identified as potential factors exacerbating food insecurity by reducing access to traditional foods.1 Coinciding with Nutrition North Canada, there has also been a growing commercialization of traditional foods (e.g., “pop-up” markets and sales on Facebook), a controversial development that some see as disrupting food-sharing networks and increasing food insecurity among poorer households by increasing reliance on store foods.7
Second, demographic change across Nunavut, and in the 10 communities that form the population of the linked research, may be contributing to food insecurity. The population of Nunavut increased by 8.7% from 2011 to 2016, and 20.8% from 2006 to 2016. Although demographic factors including household type and the presence of a child younger than 18 years are controlled for in the linked study, household size and crowding are not. In the Inuit Health Survey (2007–2008) the prevalence of household food insecurity in Nunavut was shown to be associated with household crowding,8 and research has documented that population growth can dilute traditional food-sharing networks, with implications for food security.9 An analysis of census data available from Statistics Canada would seem to indicate that the number of crowded households increased by 4% between 2006 and 2016.10
Third, over the last decade, harvest restrictions have been implemented in Nunavut for various wildlife species. Caribou, in particular, is fundamental to Inuit food systems, ranking as the top dietary source of protein in Nunavut.11 Substantial population declines for several caribou herds have been documented, with total allowable harvest designations applied to herds on Southampton Island since 2012, and for the 3 Baffin Island herds since 2015.11 Harvest restrictions and declining wildlife abundance have the potential to exacerbate food insecurity by increasing reliance on store foods, reducing income-earning opportunities, disrupting sharing networks, and limiting opportunities for youth to acquire harvesting knowledge and skills.
Lastly, Nunavut’s climate is changing rapidly, affecting access to and availability of traditional foods. Although we found few changes in access to trails used for hunting and fishing when applying Ford and colleagues’12 data set to the communities included in the linked research for the period 2006–2016, declining caribou populations and increasing stress on other species consumed by Inuit have been linked to climate change.11
Examining these alternative explanations of rising food insecurity underlines the need for qualitative ethnographies of the pathways through which policies affect Inuit food systems. Such work needs to consider both store and traditional foods, and the complex interlinkages between the two.
Despite our more cautious interpretation of the result of the linked research, we share Fafard St-Germain and colleagues’ concerns over the effectiveness of Nutrition North Canada in improving food access in Nunavut. The absence of price caps, program accountability and transparency, and limited responsiveness to community needs, have been noted to undermine the ability of the program to meet its goals, along with a neglect of traditional foods and their cultural significance in Nutrition North Canada’s support mechanisms.13 Even if these concerns were to be addressed, however, food subsidization is just one of many actions needed to tackle the complex problem of food insecurity. Policy changes are required to strengthen harvester support programs (e.g., funding for hunter and trapper organizations), invest in infrastructure and skills development, and support community wellness programs, and must accompany broader efforts focused on poverty reduction, community development, and reconciliation and healing. Recognizing the need for such cross-cutting systemic action, the Nunavut Food Security Strategy (2014, www.nunavutfoodsecurity.ca) proposes a collective vision and common agenda for impact rooted in Inuit values and knowledge. If we are to avoid going “from bad to worse,” such a vision needs to underpin all our efforts.

Nunavut’s health care system relies heavily on short-term locum physicians and nurses, many of whom come from outside the territory. Recruiting and retaining outside health care personnel is challenging in Nunavut, as in many remote regions in Canada. A recent analysis of data on physician contracts, conducted jointly for monitoring purposes by the Qaujigiartiit Health Research Centre and the Nunavut Department of Health, showed that in 2014–2016, more than half of the physicians working in Nunavut were on contracts for fewer than 20 days at a time.1 Evidence from other jurisdictions points to the negative impacts of high turnover of providers; however, studies of the impacts of a transient workforce on the quality of care in Nunavut are lacking. We discuss the drivers of poor retention of health workers in the territory, review the impacts of provider turnover on the quality of care and outline strategies to address it, including some of the initiatives currently underway in the territory.
What are some drivers of poor retention of locum health workers in Nunavut?
Provision of health care in Nunavut (as in other circumpolar regions) poses unique challenges, as its 36 000 residents live in 25 communities spread across a vast landscape (2.2 million km2) with variable weather patterns. The Nunavut Department of Health is responsible for administering a range of hospital and primary care services defined as “insured services” under the Canada Health Act,2 such as emergency care, public health, dental services and more, at no cost to all residents.3 Three of 25 communities in the territory — Iqaluit, Cambridge Bay and Rankin Inlet — have full-time physician positions, while smaller communities are serviced by physicians on a rotating clinic schedule. Twenty-two community-based clinics, staffed primarily by community health nurses (registered nurses working in an expanded scope of practice), offer primary care services. These are commonly known as community health centres and are built on the nursing station model established by the federal government in the 1950s. They deliver basic 24/7 emergency care, primary care and some public health services.4,5 The role of family physicians is to support the community health nurses, either remotely by telephone, email and telehealth, or by visiting community clinic sites.
A recent audit found that a broader scope of practice and an opportunity to discover the land and the culture of Nunavut motivate outside health care professionals to come to the territory, but the high cost of living, expensive travel, limited job opportunities for spouses, and working in isolated communities far from home are barriers to staying.6 Further, the Nunavut Department of Health does not provide adequate orientation, training and support to personnel working in community health centres; recruitment of permanent non-physician staff was found to be ineffective and there was no up-to-date recruitment and retention strategy,6 echoing other reports on human resource processes and recruitment.7 The Department of Health continues to explore and pilot strategies to improve retention.
What is the scale of the turnover of health care providers in Nunavut?
The Department of Health recently reviewed family physician service days at the Qikiqtani General Hospital in Iqaluit and in all the communities.8 The smaller communities saw fewer different family physician service providers per year, which helped ensure some continuity of care. For example, in Resolute (population 198), in 2017, 26 service days (planned according to the Nunavut model of care and based on a population of 200) were shared by 2 physicians, one of whom covered more than 80% of the service. In many of the larger communities, however, turnover of physicians was high. For example, in Pond Inlet (population 1617), 9 different physicians provided a total of 73 days of care. At the Qikiqtani General Hospital, 73 physicians (19 full-time and 54 locums) provided clinic service in 2017, with the total number of clinic days ranging from 0.5 to 47 per provider, which does not support continuity of care. The proportion of hospital service provided by full-time providers and locums varied between different departments: in obstetrics, locums provided only 1% of the service, compared with 51% in the emergency department and 62% in the hospitalist service. Analysis of the root cause of these disparities is ongoing.
Although there are no detailed data on nursing turnover in the territory, existing data on the nursing positions are sobering. In 2016, 43 (62%) of 69 community health nursing positions in Nunavut were vacant. In some regions, the vacancy rate was as high as 71%. The government relies on short-term contract agency nurses to fill these positions, which, in addition to affecting continuity of care, represents an important financial burden for the Government of Nunavut.7
How does high turnover of health providers affect quality of care?
We could find no published studies detailing how high turnover of health care providers affects quality of care in Nunavut, but studies from other jurisdictions, including remote and Indigenous communities in Canada and Australia, have highlighted low patient satisfaction, poorer health outcomes, and effects on patient and community-provider relationships and communication within health care teams and organizations.
The need to repeat stories to each new provider is exhausting for patients and can become a deterrent to going to a health centre for follow-up.9 Illnesses may be exacerbated if patients disengage from treatment, which in turn adds to burden of care for family and community members.10 High turnover of nurses has been associated with increased rates of infection and hospital admission for infection,11 overlooked symptoms and prolonged length of patient stay,12 medical errors12–14 and compromised follow-up, such as failure to refill medication orders.10
Mental health services and prevention programs are particularly affected by high turnover of providers.10,15,16 As time is devoted to allowing new staff to familiarize themselves with the health care system and the community, health promotion programs may “get put on the shelf.”10 Lack of continuity in provision of mental health services may lead to critical symptoms being missed: “A relief nurse … never has a total handle on the high-risk people … who should be questioned further on their mental health status, [so] some things go out the door.”10
Respectful and trusting relationships constitute an important Inuit value and are essential for providing high-quality, community-centred care,17 but these are difficult to maintain when staff is constantly changing. Provider turnover can result in depersonalized services and lack of trust in the community.18 Community members value having a stable provider whom they trust,19,20 and establishing trusting relationships can improve patient engagement.21
Within health care teams and organizations, staff turnover represents additional training workload for professionals, inconsistencies in service provision18 and lower levels of work group cohesion and coordination22; poor coordination of care and poor communication between multiple providers is one of the key risk factors for medication errors.14 High turnover can also affect the morale and productivity of nurses who remain to provide care while new staff are hired and oriented.11,13,23 Nurses and doctors may find it difficult to adapt to new social and work environments and many have poor work–life balance.24 Culture shock and lack of cultural orientation impede productivity and communication with patients, and compromise provision of culturally competent care to the communities.10,25–27
How can retention of the health care workforce in Nunavut be improved?
Use of contract personnel is beneficial in the short term to meet service goals to remote communities. However, this does not contribute to well-resourced local health care services.24 Meeting nursing service requirements will require the use of short-term replacement or contract nurses in the immediate future. Given this situation, initiatives to improve quality of care in the current context of high turnover are important.
Adequate training and support, and especially orientation to the Nunavut health care system and cross-cultural training to provide culturally competent care, are much needed, as professionals who come from outside the territory have reported lack of such training and support.6,27 Ongoing training of local translators (for instance, in medical terminology) is also necessary to ensure effective communication between patients and medical professionals from outside the territory who do not speak Inuktitut or Inuinnaqtun.6
Poor patient follow-up resulting from constantly changing providers could be minimized with the use of electronic medical records, which can help coordinate care, referrals, diagnostic tests and prescription medications. The Department of Health is in the process of implementing such a system across Nunavut. It is an ongoing challenge to adapt systems designed for southern health care organizations that have excellent broadband connectivity to the High Arctic’s small communities, which are dependent on low-bandwidth satellite connectivity.
In the middle to long term, training and hiring Inuit and Northern nurses who are interested in remaining to serve their communities would be the best strategy for strengthening community health services in Nunavut. In the Nunatsiavut region of Newfoundland and Labrador, 30 Inuit nurses have been registered over the past 30 years, as a result of several initiatives, including providing training close to students’ home communities, designing culturally relevant programs and guaranteeing employment.28
Regarding physician retention, the short- to mid-term focus of physician leadership is reliant on committed non-Inuit physicians who live in Nunavut, or who return regularly for shorter periods. This strategy has had some impact in Iqaluit and the other regional centres of Rankin Inlet and Cambridge Bay, where in 2017 there were 19 full-time family physicians, 3 pediatricians and a general surgeon on long-term contracts. While the analysis of data on physician turnover in Iqaluit is still ongoing, it appears that positions and scheduling that allow for work–life balance are more sustainable and attract physicians who are willing to sign longer-term contracts. Being mindful and respectful of Inuit and Indigenous values that connect family, loved ones and caring for others, it then becomes critical that scheduling and health service design celebrate and embody those values in practice to recruit and retain local and Indigenous health service providers.
The Truth and Reconciliation Commission called for training of more Indigenous doctors and nurses.29 Initiatives currently underway include the engagement of role models and implementation of health science camps for high school students and partnerships with Indigenous organizations and universities. There is evidence that exposing students to rural and remote practice has a positive influence on recruiting and retaining family physicians in Canada.30,31 The University of Manitoba, for instance, has been running a rural practice program for first-year medical students for more than 12 years, which has contributed to changing students’ attitude to Northern medicine and increasing their interest in working in these communities.32
Along with student training, several other factors influencing health professionals’ choice to practice in remote regions were described in recent reviews.30,33–37 Research has also been conducted on the “design and development of products and services to address ways of improving recruitment and supporting retention.” 38 Based on the data presented in this paper, in Nunavut specifically, it is retaining medical personnel that has been challenging, rather than recruiting them. We know much about factors that contribute to provider turnover and have access to a number of ideas and strategies to address it, but we need more evaluative evidence on the initiatives as well as the effectiveness of specific strategies (examples can be found in the conclusions of some of these reviews35,39). We hope to encourage researchers and professionals to report on various initiatives and their evaluation findings.
Conclusion
Existing studies provide compelling data showing the negative impacts of provider turnover on community members, health care providers and organizations. To ensure quality care in the communities, both long-term strategies to establish stable local health services and strategies to improve cultural competency and knowledge of the health care system of the short-term personnel currently working in the territory are needed. We also need more data on the impact of turnover of health providers specifically in Nunavut, and on best practices and solutions to ensure quality care in high- transiency Northern communities. Nunavummiut, like all Canadians, want and deserve consistent care from well-trained, committed care providers who know their patients and have a good understanding of the cultural, social and geographical conditions of their patients’ lives.

Winters aren’t just hard in Nunavut; they are severe. Temperatures can plunge to minus 45 degrees Celsius (minus 50 degrees Fahrenheit) in parts of Canada’s northernmost territory, some of which is located above the Arctic Circle. But the beauty is exquisite; views of the northern lights are spectacular there.
“It is one of the most exotic places in Canada, and the most natural,” Mary-Lee Sandy-Aliyak, a recruitment specialist with the Government of Nunavut, says of her territory.
“But it is also a challenging place to live. In addition to the weather, there are no roads or railroads between the 25 communities of this vast territory, one-fifth of Canada’s total land mass. Nunavut is only accessible by air, and during summer, by boat.”
Nunavut – which means “Our land” in Inuktitut, one of the Inuit languages, has been home to an indigenous population for more than 4,000 years. Today, more than 80% of the population is of Inuit descent.
And while the territory is huge, the population is not: 39,000 people. The smallest community is Grise Fiord, with 130; the largest, Iqaluit, the capital of Nunavut, has 8,500 people.
“There are not a lot of resources for fixing things,” says Sandy-Aliyak, whose job includes helping Inuit employees get training and education to advance their career. “You really have to be independent, whether you make your own clothes, service and fix your own house stuff. You have to know how to do maintenance on all of your things, whether it be the computer, the toaster, the fridge, vehicles – you name it.”

The COVID-19 pandemic could have resulted in an even more isolated way of life. But as countries around the world started to lock down last spring, the Government of Nunavut was gearing up to put Microsoft Teams into place for many of its 5,200-plus employees and additional support workers – scattered around the territory – providing a new way for them to meet virtually. Nunavut was also planning to use Teams as a tool to help government departments and agencies improve and deliver programs and services to remote communities throughout the territory.
Technologically, “we were once significantly behind, however as a result of recent events, we have come a long way,” says Dean Wells, corporate chief information officer for the Government of Nunavut.
“That is changing dramatically with the help of Teams and moving to the cloud with Office 365 and SharePoint online. It was something that was not possible until now because of bandwidth restrictions.”
Sandy-Aliyak says Teams has been important to provide training that might not otherwise take place during the pandemic.
“Until the pandemic, some employees attending conferences often would have to fly within the territory to attend the gatherings, something that can be time-consuming and costly. For example, it’s nearly a three-hour plane ride from Grise Fiord to Iqaluit, and flights into some of the communities are weekly, not daily. All communities are quite spread out, and between each community, travel can be between $2,000 to $10,000 per person.”
She was part of a leadership course of 24 that originally met in person and moved to Teams because of the pandemic. Teams is also where the class graduation took place.
“It was nice to see everybody’s faces because we couldn’t see each other in person,” Sandy-Aliyak says.
In November 2019, the Government of Nunavut was hit by a ransomware attack that took down everything, from the phone system to the government’s servers. Following the attack, the government considered whether to rebuild the old network or move forward with something different.
“Microsoft was among the firms that helped with the restoration of systems,” says Wells. “The security provided by Microsoft was also crucial to the Government of Nunavut considering the impact of ransomware. When the government decided to move to the cloud, Microsoft became not only a contributor but a partner as well.”
Working together toward a common goal is important in Nunavut and part of Inuit culture. Taking care of each other and respect for Elders are key. Inuktitut, the first language of 70% of the residents of Nunavut, is integral to the teamwork and the traditional passing of knowledge. Adam Guimond-Pishuktie, a 19-year-old records analyst, grew up not knowing how to speak Inuktitut, and it bothered him.
“I have felt a little left out, but also kind of bad,” he says. “My friends can speak it to each other, but I don’t understand it, so it’s a language barrier – especially with the Elders. Whenever an Elder will come to me, to ask for help or whatever, I don’t speak the language, and I have to get someone else to translate.”
When a class to learn Inuktitut started being offered via Teams to government employees, Guimond-Pishuktie eagerly signed up.
“We have Teams meetings every week, and it helps a lot,” he says. “You can try to learn it online and try to understand the grammar yourself. But it’s a lot harder, you’re not understanding how to pronounce words. On Teams, the teachers are very helpful with that.”

Additional help is also now available: Microsoft recently added Inuktitut text translation to Microsoft Translator. The launch coincides with Inuktut Language Month in Nunavut. Inuktitut is the primary dialect of the Inuktut language. Other official languages and dialects used in the territory include English and French and Inuinnaqtun.
To add Inuktitut translation, Microsoft worked closely with the Government of Nunavut to get the language data needed to create the new translation system. The effort is part of Microsoft’s AI for Cultural Heritage program, in which $10 million over five years is committed to support projects dedicated to the preservation and enrichment of cultural heritage that leverage the power of artificial intelligence, such as the Inuktitut text translation.
In addition to Nunavut, Inuktitut is spoken across northern Canada including the Northwest Territories, Manitoba, Québec, and Newfoundland and Labrador. It is in the Eskimo-Aleut language family, which is spoken as far west as Russia, through Canada, and into eastern Greenland. Other languages in this family include Yup’ik, Aleut and Inuktun.
Wells sees that the ability of Teams to reach individuals not only during a pandemic, but at any time, is a huge plus for the people of Nunavut. Within the government, video conferencing can cut down travel expenses, reducing the number of flights, hotels and meals the government needs to pay for.
Using Teams, the Government of Nunavut can also reach subject matter experts and consultants outside of the territory more easily, paving the way for expanded possibilities in health, and for students to get tutoring and school courses through Teams.
“They’re getting tutoring when they can’t get additional help in the community, they can reach out and get one-on-one tutoring through Teams,” says Wells. “The discomfort and shyness that some students feel in a class – they’re afraid to put up their hands, they’re afraid to ask questions – you don’t get that with a one-on-one tutor in your home.”
Sandy-Aliyak has never been afraid to put up her hand, although she understands how others can feel that way. Athletic and adventurous, she was the youngest of five children, and “learned to be outgoing and not shy at all,” she says. Her avocation is as a stand-up comedian, and she says she’s mulling how she could use Teams for a comedy show, or as a way for comedians who are spread out to practice their routines together. It’s emblematic of how Teams capabilities can improve residents’ quality of life with training, employment, education and entertainment.
Wells says having Teams means a whole different world.
“Whoever’s got a PC now can really access Teams and go to work,” he says. “I don’t want to make it sound like we’ve got utopia built here because we don’t. There’s still a lot to do and a long way to grow in terms of internet service and connections in Nunavut. But there’s an awful lot of hope, and people are motivated now that they can see what’s possible. The quality of life is going to improve dramatically.”

Winters aren’t just hard in Nunavut; they are severe. Temperatures can plunge to minus 45 degrees Celsius (minus 50 degrees Fahrenheit) in parts of Canada’s northernmost territory, some of which is located above the Arctic Circle. But the beauty is exquisite; views of the northern lights are spectacular there.
“It is one of the most exotic places in Canada, and the most natural,” Mary-Lee Sandy-Aliyak, a recruitment specialist with the Government of Nunavut, says of her territory.
“But it is also a challenging place to live. In addition to the weather, there are no roads or railroads between the 25 communities of this vast territory, one-fifth of Canada’s total land mass. Nunavut is only accessible by air, and during summer, by boat.”
Nunavut – which means “Our land” in Inuktitut, one of the Inuit languages, has been home to an indigenous population for more than 4,000 years. Today, more than 80% of the population is of Inuit descent.
And while the territory is huge, the population is not: 39,000 people. The smallest community is Grise Fiord, with 130; the largest, Iqaluit, the capital of Nunavut, has 8,500 people.
“There are not a lot of resources for fixing things,” says Sandy-Aliyak, whose job includes helping Inuit employees get training and education to advance their career. “You really have to be independent, whether you make your own clothes, service and fix your own house stuff. You have to know how to do maintenance on all of your things, whether it be the computer, the toaster, the fridge, vehicles – you name it.”

The COVID-19 pandemic could have resulted in an even more isolated way of life. But as countries around the world started to lock down last spring, the Government of Nunavut was gearing up to put Microsoft Teams into place for many of its 5,200-plus employees and additional support workers – scattered around the territory – providing a new way for them to meet virtually. Nunavut was also planning to use Teams as a tool to help government departments and agencies improve and deliver programs and services to remote communities throughout the territory.

Nestled among rolling hills and tundra, Cambridge Bay is located on Victoria Island and is an important stop for cruises and private ships traversing the Northwest Passage.
History
In Cambridge Bay you can feel the echoes of the long search for the Northwest Passage. European contact began in 1839 and grew steadily. as the quest for the passage heated up. Norwegian explorer, Roald Amundsen’s ship, the ‘Maud’ sank into the harbour in Cambridge Bay and its exposed hull has been has been a local landmark for eight decades. This wreck was salvaged in 2016 and returns to Norway for its final step of conservation and preservation. Nonetheless, you can still feel the presence of Maud, after having rested on the seabed for 85 years.
The military has maintained a presence in Cambridge Bay since 1947 with the construction of a large LORAN (long range navigation) tower. This was followed in 1955 by the construction of a “Distant Early Warning Line (DEW Line)” base in the community. This sentinel still stands tall as a vital part of the North Warning System, controlled by the Canadian and United States Military. It remains operational today and as part of the joint Canada and US Warning System.
Activities
Inuit have lived in the Cambridge Bay area for 4000 years as it continues to be an excellent hunting and fishing spot. Today you can still enjoy Arctic char fishing, a ‘green’ and sustainable seafood. Travel to nearby Ovayok Territorial Park, an area that has been vital to local Inuit life for centuries. The park has numerous hiking trails and camping spots, allowing you to immerse yourself in the habitat of a muskox herd.
The community hosts the 'Omingmak Frolics' each May, which include seal hunting and ice carving competitions, fishing contests, talent shows, children's games, dog sledding and snowmobiling races.
Also, renowned for its local art, Cambridge Bay was home to artist, Inuk Charlie and the tradition continues with today’s artists. Local galleries highlight the beautiful works of Cambridge Bay’s famous carvers, who use materials that are unique to the area.
Additional Information
Communities in Nunavut have the right to determine their Liquor System. In this community, alcohol is unrestricted. The laws surrounding importation and consumption follow the Nunavut Liquor Act.
Whether you live in or travel to an unrestricted or restricted community, you need a liquor permit to bring more than three litres of spirits, nine litres of wine, or 26 litres of beer with you when you travel into Nunavut. Liquor permits are always required when you place a liquor order outside the territory.

Majestic and ubiquitous, you can find Nanuq - the polar bear - throughout our territory. As most communities are located by the ocean, most places are within range of the bears. The best time to see Nanuq is usually in the fall, when they gather on the shorelines waiting for sea ice to form. This brings bears in close contact with many communities, but especially places like Arviat, Hall Beach, Pond Inlet, Naujaat and Resolute.
The polar bear is a clever and dangerous animal, with males weighing up to 700kgs and over 3m in length. They are extremely capable hunters, experts at catching seals and sometimes whales. Excellent swimmers, polar bears are known to swim in open oceans for hundreds of kilometers.
You can find these bears in various settings- from inside communities (Arviat has had to hold Halloween Trick or Treating inside the school gym because of the number of polar bears near the community), to the floe edge, where they will be in search of food. .

This is a condensed version of the article ‘Digging sustainability: scaling and sectoring of sovereignty in Greenland and Nunavut mining discourses’, recently published in the anthology The Politics of Sustainability in the Arctic: Reconfiguring Identity, Time and Space.
The book sets out a theoretical framework for understanding and analysing sustainability as a political concept, and provides a comprehensive empirical investigation of Arctic sustainability discourses. Presenting a range of case studies from a number of Arctic countries including Greenland, Norway and Canada, the essays in this volume analyse the concept of sustainability and how actors are employing and contesting this concept in specific regions within the Arctic. In doing so, the book demonstrates how sustainability is being given new meanings in the postcolonial Arctic and what the political implications are for postcoloniality, nature, and development more broadly. Beyond those interested in the Arctic, this book will also be of great value to students and scholars of sustainability, sustainable development, identity and environmental politics.

Sustainable Arctic Mining? A Comparative Analysis of Greenland and Nunavut Mining Discourses
The question of whether or not to mine is often placed center-stage in discussions about rights and resources in the Arctic. Some primarily perceive mining as the key to a better economy, while others put greater emphasis on the possible threat to nature. Both sides do, however, insist that the concept of sustainability is inevitable to their argument which, on the one hand, unites the conflicting parts, while on the other hand drains the concept of meaning.
In contrast with harvesting, hunting, fishing, and the exploitation of other renewable resources, minerals are non-renewable and, thus, not possible to sustain if simultaneously being extracted. Hence, ‘sustainable mining’ may be perceived as an oxymoron used by those in favor to co-opt and neutralize critique from environmentalists.1) Through other lenses, it may instead be a sign of environmental, economic, and social responsibility in a capitalist world where development is imperative. The three responsibilities are, however, seldom weighed equally and it is in these nuances that the political becomes observable.
In Greenland and Nunavut, opportunities and possible threats related to mining often give rise to public attention and debate about what the perfect future should look like. Some highlight the importance of preservation (sustaining), while others emphasise the possibilities that change (development) may bring. This activates different and occasionally conflicting perceptions of what the collective identity entails, how mining may affect local standards of living, and, sometimes, how it relates to regional and global concerns and movements.
By comparing the Greenland and the Nunavut mining discourses – as articulated in the official strategies and in relation to the projects in Citronen Fiord and Mary River – this article investigates what kind of meaning is ascribed to the concept of sustainability, how priorities are made, and how responsibility is distributed. This is particularly interesting within the Arctic context, where sustainable development has become an omnipresent buzzword2) – particularly prominent in Arctic mining debates3) – and where Nunavut and Greenland as partners in tradition and in transition4) continue to alter the political landscape by gaining more independent voices.
Greenland: mining for a new nation, stretching ‘the local’
In Greenland’s Oil and Mineral Strategy 2014–2018, ‘sustainable development’ abounds: Across 102 pages, the sustainability concept is mentioned 37 times, and two chapters (2.5 and 7) are dedicated to explaining how the broad sense of ‘sustainable development’ – as defined by the World Commission on Environment and Development (WCED) in 1987 – is the guiding principle for developing the vast mineral resources with careful environmental, economic, and social considerations.
Much importance is attached to the imagined future mineral exploitation, which is not merely framed as a single significant business opportunity, but as a general development of the whole country that will “involve an adjustment of our entire way of organizing society”.5) The Government of Greenland “believes that it is important that all of us contribute to a sustainable development of the area of mineral resources activities”,6) and in its aim to actively involve the broader public, a popularized version of the strategy has subsequently been distributed.7)
The responsibility for making this development sustainable is, thus, not limited to the politicians, the mining companies, or the individual citizens, but instead everyone is expected to partake as stakeholders in this national endeavor. As such, the strategy discursively places all potential mining projects in Greenland on the national scale, while making a diffuse and encompassing ‘all of us’ responsible for fulfilling its unredeemed potential. While this is the case in the national strategy – which per definition is, exactly, national in its scope – it is necessary to dig deeper into the consultation processes of individual projects to get a more nuanced understanding of who is made responsible for what, and on which scale.
The case of Citronen Fiord and the ‘flexibility’ towards independence
One of the strategy’s six prioritized projects is the proposed zinc and lead mine in Citronen Fiord, which the Australian company Ironbark has the license to exploit. The project is located in the national park, where no one but a couple of handfuls of Danish servicemen and a few polar scientists live. Hence, there is no obvious local place to conduct public hearings, which is why Ironbark, the relevant ministers, and civil servants visited seven towns in Greenland’s four municipalities to engage in a dialogue with the public. The selected towns were (attendees/population): Nuuk (30/17,600), Kangerlussuaq (8/500), Ilulissat (8/4,555), Sisimiut (30/5,414), Qaqortoq (?/3,084), Tasiilaq (100/2,010), and Qaanaaq (200/623) of which the latter two were given special attention because they are nearest Citronen Fiord.
Though their ‘proximity’ is limited to approximately 2,000km to the south and 1,000km to the west, respectively, the two towns were discursively constructed as the local scale, even if the immediate economic impact will be abroad in Longyearbyen, Svalbard, from where most air transportation for the proposed mine will arrive, and Akureyri, Iceland, which is expected to be the port of departure for most shipping.8) If environmental concerns had been the decisive optic for determining the local scale, Svalbard could also have been a relevant place to conduct public hearings, as it is located less than 1,000km east of Citronen Fiord.
During the hearings, environmental concerns were almost entirely articulated in relation to the local and national scales, where the possible risk to marine mammals and fishes constituted the greatest worry primarily because they are the main ingredients in traditional Greenlandic food, at the core of Greenlandic culture.9) This reflects the idea, promoted by the then coalition government, that “[t]he sustainability principle is a Greenlandic invention where the first provisions on sustainable exploitation of animals were formulated in the Thule Laws, and these principles must be upheld and honored”.10)
While the sustainability concept articulated in the Thule Laws points to the importance of environmental and social preservation, the communication regarding Citronen Fiord generally puts greater emphasis on development and economic gain, echoing the decision not to sign the Paris Agreement,11) as the Citronen Fiord mine alone is expected to cause a 20 per cent increase in Greenland’s current total CO2 emissions (cf. Qujaukitsoq at public hearing in Sisimiut). Via the Environmental Impact Assessment – made in the process prior to the IBA – the mining company and respective authorities scrutinise how to mitigate the potential environmental impacts, but the responsibility for ultimately doing so is placed on the shoulders of the mining companies – a decision characterised as ‘pioneering’ in the strategy.12)
The prioritization is clear: mining must be realized in order to sustain the national economy even though it may have some negative environmental impacts. As put by then Minister for Finance, Energy, and Foreign Affairs, Vittus Qujaukitsoq from the social democratic party Siumut, when interviewed about why mining is now allowed in Citronen Fiord despite the past ban on any economic activities in the area: “The national park is the most pristine part of our country, and it is important for all animal and plant life. But we have to be flexible if new business opportunities arise”.13) Such flexibility is legitimized by the overall goal of future independence, which is dependent on new significant sources of income. This was repeatedly emphasized by Qujaukitsoq, who stated at the public hearing in Ilulissat: “We will never be independent if we leave our resources untouched”, and by then Minister for Business, Labour, and Trade, Randi Vestergaard Evaldsen from the social liberal party Demokraatit, who argued at the public hearing in Qaqortoq that “by giving companies the opportunity to establish mining projects we are paving the way towards independence”.
One displeased citizen protested that “I feel Greenland is just being sold”,(cf. public hearing in Tasiilaq) and another asked, “Could we postpone such projects until Greenland has been declared independent? We hear about many projects which are never being realized” (cf. public hearing in Iulissat). However, the dominant storyline throughout the hearings was that the Citronen Fiord mine and other similar proposed projects must be established for the benefit of fulfilling the Greenlandic ambition of independence.
Nunavut: social license to drill towards devolution
In Nunavut’s mining strategy, Parnautit: A Foundation for the Future, the sustainability concept is mentioned 20 times across 64 pages, often in central parts of the strategy. The first page states that the strategy serves as: “the plan of the Government of Nunavut to create opportunities for the future self-reliance of Nunavut and Nunavummiut through the sustainable development of our mineral resources. It is intended to guide that development in the period leading up to the devolution of management responsibilities for lands and resources from the federal government”.14)
As in Greenland, mining is ascribed much importance as a key element to increased self-determination, but while the words used in the neighboring mining discourse when describing Greenland’s present and future status are ‘country’ and ‘independence’, the terminology used in Nunavut is instead ‘territory’ and ‘devolution’. This reflects the different directions of their respective postcolonial developments, while simultaneously indicating that both governments perceive mining as the most likely economic contributor to increased autonomy.
Sustaining the territorial economy is at the core of Nunavut’s official mining discourse, but unlike the ‘flexibility’ that Minister Qujaukitsoq pleaded for when explaining the necessity of allowing mining in Greenland’s national park, environmental concerns are more explicitly addressed in Nunavut. After stating that “Nunavut’s future economic viability, and the improvement of the quality of life of Nunavummiut, will depend on the development of these known and yet to be discovered resources”,15) the strategy emphasises that “Nunavut’s arctic environment is fragile, however, and Nunavummiut will not tolerate development that has unacceptable environmental impacts”.16)
The line between acceptable and unacceptable is not further explained, but mining companies are advised to pay special attention to public opinion, as the social license is inevitable for a successful operation. The social license is obtained through involving the local community by, for example, hiring local workers which can benefit social sustainability, and through minimising the environmental impact by “treating their project as a ‘temporary use of the land’, and fully rehabilitating the site for other uses after mining or exploration is complete”.17) Thus, the environmental and social sectors are also given high priority in the assessment of how a potential mine may contribute to the development of all of Nunavut and the individual local communities.
The case of Mary River and the use of IQ
It may be a delicate balancing act to sustain both the environment, the economy, and the social sector when mining. This is acknowledged by the Government of Nunavut, which clearly expresses that “[i]nevitably, the push towards development of mineral resources and the need for environmental protection will create conflicts”.18) In this light, a Planning Commission is currently working on a comprehensive Land Use Plan in order to “proactively resolve potential conflicts between mineral exploration parties requiring access to land, and wildlife and community uses”.19) While this initiative presents a broader scope, including sectors other than mining, the individual projects aim at proactively settling disagreements via public hearings in the areas deemed most affected by the proposed mining activity.
In the case of the Mary River iron mine, the five communities of Igloolik (155km to the mine), Pond Inlet (160km), Hall Beach (192km), Arctic Bay (280km), and Clyde River (415km) were pointed out as the places in the ‘immediate vicinity’ with ‘long term social, economic and environmental ties to the proposed ERP [Early Revenue Phase] area’.20) When a place is labelled as being in the ‘immediate vicinity’, it also means that its citizens have better chances of being employed in or in relation to the mine. This was often highlighted by the local representatives as the main reason why they are ultimately in favour of the project despite accompanying potential risks – such as negative environmental impacts especially connected to shipping of the iron, abusive use of alcohol and drugs,21) and other related consequences known from similar fly-in fly-out camp environments.22)
In the North Baffin region where Mary River is located, 94 per cent of the population are Inuit, and Inuktitut is the prevalent language with some monolingual speakers, ranging from 6 per cent in Hall Beach to 24 per cent in Igloolik.23) The ethnic majority and respect for Inuit traditions are central in the Nunavut mining discourse, mirrored in the name of the IBA, which has an extra I indicating that it is, indeed, an Inuit Impact Benefit Agreement (IIBA).
In Nunavut’s official mining strategy and in the Land Use Plan, the dominating WCED understanding of sustainable development is particularly visible, but when Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit – meaning ‘Inuit knowledge’ and often abbreviated ‘IQ’ – is included, the hegemonic perception is contested: “[s]ustainable development is not a fixed understanding. As communities change, their relationship with the land and with each other will continue to develop and evolve”.24)
Despite this contestation, the Inuktitut translation of ‘sustainable’ is quite clear. Ikupik, as it is called, means “to conserve and not take all at once; what is brought in from a hunt. Everyone takes a piece for their family, ensuring there is enough to go around”.25) As in the Thule Laws, the sustainability principle is closely linked to food security and social sustainability through covering the basic needs of the local community. This definition makes sense for hunting and harvesting of renewable resources, but in the case of non-renewable minerals this traditional understanding is open to interpretation – and even more so when adding the perception that the concept is in flux.
During the hearings, neither the traditional Inuit definition nor the contestation of the hegemonic WCED understanding were articulated. Instead, utterances about sustainability usually referred to one particular sector, where local representatives emphasise the importance of sustaining the local communities, and the official authorities put more weight on the sector closest to their respective area of responsibility. In this way, the executive director of the Nunavut Planning Commission, Sharon Ehaloak, encouraged economic sustainable development,26) and the environmental specialist of Parks Canada, Allison Stoddart, only talked about environmental sustainability,27) while Karen Costello – the resource director of the Nunavut Office of Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development – said that her mandate is to “improve social and economic well-being and develop healthier, more sustainable communities”.28)
While they all agree that if the mine should be established it needs to be in a sustainable manner, the nuances of the different prioritized sectors demonstrate how they may represent different political agendas. Consequently, a compromise needs to be found to balance these different considerations in the development of Nunavut – a development which is predominantly human-centered, as all parts in favor of the mine agree that economic gain should benefit some size of a social entity; the individual, the community, the company, the territory, and the nation.
Conclusion
Nunavut’s and Greenland’s postcolonial developments have been closely related to the acquisition of the right to exploit their own mineral resources. In Greenland, this parallel process seems to continue, while mining in Nunavut is subject to undisguised conflicts between primarily economic and environmental priorities, proactively addressed by the authorities in their aim to direct the territory towards a future where all Nunavummiut feel at home.
In both cases, the social sustainability is given high priority. While hunting traditions are emphasized as central to each respective collective identity – which in Nunavut’s case unquestionably equals an Inuit identity – the striving for independence is the overarching goal legitimizing mining in Greenland’s national park, despite a past ban on any economic activities in the area. In Nunavut, more attention is ascribed to the local community that shall benefit economically and socially, while ‘the national’ is a label exclusively reserved for the Canadian Federation. Instead, Nunavut is described as a territory that loyally respects Canada’s sovereignty, even though decisions such as the 2016 moratorium on hydrocarbon exploitation in the North American Arctic waters was signed without prior consultation with the territorial governments.
The analyses show how sovereignty is closely connected to the question of who gets to decide what to sustain, which is particularly visible in the cases of Nunavut and Greenland, where exploitation of their natural resources is perceived as a potential core contributor to a more viable economy and increased self-determination. The concept of sustainability is, to some degree, contested by Indigenous definitions, but in both discourses the WCED’s 1987 description of sustainable development is generally the main point of reference, hence reproducing the hegemonic perception. The defining nuances rendering visible how priorities are made, responsibilities are distributed, and what consequences these decisions may have in the future are, however, found in the weighing of different scales and sectors, as one often takes precedence over the others. In Greenland, this weight is primarily put on the national economy, while the Nunavut mining discourse gives more precedence to local social sustainability. These prioritizations do, however, sometimes overlap, causing the spillover of impacts and benefits across sectors and scales.

Introduction
The Arctic has been the subject of increasing resource extraction, research activities, political debate, and press coverage. Media reports often refer to the Arctic as a “vast wilderness,” “barren land,” “untouched landscape”, and “isolated ice-covered world”. Our Arctic is not a barren, untouched, icy wilderness: our Arctic is home. Stories about the Arctic often feature maps, which omit the dots that show where our communities are located. Our people and livelihoods are an afterthought—if they are even a thought at all. We live here, grow up here, love here, and thrive here. We try our best to live in harmony with the wildlife and the lands that have sustained Arctic peoples for millennia. Yes, millennia.
We may have small populations, but we are inventive and resourceful, and we have opportunities in our governance structure to be innovative in how health care models for our communities can be developed and implemented. Discourse about health in Indigenous communities in Canada has largely focused on the application of western or non-Indigenous approaches to understanding wellness. Recently, a growing body of literature has focused on articulating Indigenous knowledge perspectives on wellness, contributing to more meaningful understanding of the challenges experienced by indigenous communities1) I come from Nunavut (NU), which is one of Canada’s three territories and is considered part of the country’s eastern Arctic. In the Canadian North, the territorial governments administer most health services, with some exceptions in Yukon where some programs and services have been transferred to First Nations communities.2) Although the movement to self-determination for Indigenous people has advanced the most in Nunavut and in neighboring Greenland, self-government and control of health services have not translated into better health outcomes.3)
This article will first provide an overview of historic and contemporary events in Nunavut. Then, it will summarize the transition of this Arctic region in the last several decades and the context of Inuit community health and wellness concerns today. Lastly, Inuit concepts are shared, which can be used to inform a model for health care that reflects the values of the people it serves.
Historical Context
Inuit are the Indigenous inhabitants of the North American Arctic, whose homeland stretches from the Bering Strait to east Greenland, a distance of over 6,000km. They live in Russia, Alaska, Greenland, and Canada . And despite the distances between communities, the Inuit share a common cultural heritage, language, and genetic ancestry. Inuit have occupied these Arctic regions for 5,000 years.4) Of the approximately 150,000 Inuit living in the circumpolar region today, 45,000 live in the four Canadian Nunangat (Inuit lands): Nunavut, Nunavik (Northern Quebec), Inuvialuit (northern Northwest Territories), and Nunatsiavut (northern Labrador). Nunavut, the largest of the Inuit lands, became Canada’s third Territory in 1999.
(Re-)Settlement
Before the arrival of other peoples, Inuit lived a nomadic lifestyle in ilagiit nunagivaktangat or camps.5)) Although the process of relocation to communities began as a response by Inuit to the presence of traders, explorers, and missionaries, it took new forms with the systematic efforts of the government in the 1950s to “resettle” Canada’s North. At that time, the Canadian government implemented resettlement programs in the Eastern Arctic, moving Inuit to more remote areas to protect Canada’s sovereignty and trade, while also moving Inuit off the land to reduce relief costs—facilitating the provision of supplies, policing education, and to improve healthcare for remote populations.6)
The Report of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples (1996) noted that in these years government administrators were concerned with the reports of health and welfare coming out of the North, and they came to see the North as being in a state of crisis, which required immediate attention and hastened the government to form settlements 7). Tuberculosis epidemics among Inuit required immediate attention. Inuit children were enveloped in the residential school system and separated from their families. Early in this period, one high-ranking official wrote that his job was “to hasten the day when in every respect the Eskimos can take their own places in the new kind of civilization which we – and they – are building in their country.” This perspective, which did not take into account the perspectives of Inuit, was never realized.8) Kirmayer, Tait, and Simpson argued that over the past century, Canadian and American government policies have continued the initial processes of colonization and have destroyed Indigenous cultures and ways of life through forced settlement, the creation of reserves, relocation to remote regions, residential schools, chronic underfunding and poor resourcing of essential services such as health care and education, and bureaucratic control.9) In the process, opportunities arose which allowed Inuit to adapt their own styles of leadership and coordination to the new situation.10)
Resettlement and Imposition of Rapid Transformation without Consultation
The changes imposed on Inuit were rapid. It was not a gradual progression from a traditional to a modern way of life, but a complete transformation.11) Inuit were not consulted about the resettlement and education policies that were implemented and many never knew why they were imposed. For their part, the agencies of the Government of Canada that were responsible for the transformation, primarily Indian and Northern Affairs Canada12) and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, are still not fully aware of their own history in the Arctic or the effects of their decisions and actions.13)
A few settlements originated as trading posts, so they remained close to good hunting and harvesting areas. For the remaining posts, the single most important criterion for the government was that they were accessible by sea or would fit into planned air routes, therefore many of the settlements were not located near good harvesting areas.14) The community of Arviat, NU,15) for example, was built on a coastal swamp, far from the inland caribou herds, which Inuit had followed for centuries and which are still provide essential food for the community today. The Report of the Qikiqtani Truth Commission stated that Inuit have suffered and continue to suffer from this lack of attention to their hunting and harvesting needs, which play a critical role for their wellness.16)
Contemporary Context
Today, there are 25 communities in Nunavut ranging in size from 150 people to a population of 7,100.17) All of the communities are geographically isolated from each other and are only accessible by air, water, or in winter by snowmobile. The population of Nunavut in 2016 was 37,100, of whom approximately 85% are Inuit.18) Fifty-two percent of Nunavummiut speak the Inuit languages Inuktitut or Inuinnaqtun at home.19) Nunavut has a very young population compared to Canada as a whole. In 2011, 57% of the Nunavut population was comprised of those 24 years of age and younger compared to 29% in the whole of Canada.20) Today, there is a chronic shortage of housing that contributes to overcrowding among many families with young children in almost every community in Nunavut.21) Influences from sources such as the media, television, education system,22) as well as residential schooling,23) settlement into larger communities,24) and related traumas25) have contributed to a shift in the traditional way of life in communities.
Pervasive social problems in Nunavut such as poverty, lack of adequate housing and overcrowding, food insecurity, and traumas have a substantial impact on the quality of life for many Nunavummiut.26) Public health services and health promotion initiatives are largely the domain of the territorial Department of Health. These programs consist of maternal-child health supports (e.g. well-baby clinics, immunization clinics, breastfeeding support, prenatal nutrition programs), chronic disease management, environmental health, anti-tobacco use initiatives, sexual health, infectious disease control, oral health, and nutrition and food security initiatives.27)
Nunavut has one hospital in Iqaluit and two larger health centers in the regional centers Rankin Inlet and Cambridge Bay staffed by physicians. Health centers staffed by community health nurses service the rest of the communities and physicians make visits throughout the year. Specialized services are accessed at tertiary care facilities in Yellowknife, NT, Edmonton, AB, Winnipeg, MB, or Ottawa, ON, if more advanced or complex care is required.
The association between indigenous self-government, community control of health services and health equity is complex and influenced by a multitude of political, social and economic factors. Funds for health care in Nunavut originate from the federal government.28) Even though the primary care part of the system is core-funded, its funds are insufficient to pay for a system that is so widely spread out and so heavily dependent on hospitals and medical professionals based in Southern Canada.29) This unwieldy, fragmented, and logistically stretched primary care system is not sustainable. Nunavut Tunngavik Inc. (2008) has asserted that the health care system must evolve into a truly Nunavut-centered system. This can begin with a primary health care approach, which is based on Indigenous and Inuit philosophical concepts related to wellness. Such an approach would allow the healing and wellness strengths of Inuit culture and society to flourish as integral parts of the health system.
Indigenous Health Care Models
Significant advances have been made to engage Indigenous communities in health care and research. However, there remains a need for health care models that are born from Indigenous perspectives on wellness, from the design to the implementation and delivery.30) Current biomedical models operate under the assumption that the presentation of a symptom or illness is secondary to disease.31) The assumption that a specific disease underlies all illnesses has led to the medicalization32) of conditions, which are simply part of the human experience, such as menopause or aging.33) It has also diminished the credibility of ill patients who do not appear to have any demonstrable or detectable disease.34) Indigenous wellness perspectives are formulated on understandings of the world, which are based on interactions between people, as well as interactions with the land, animal, and spirit worlds.35) Illness may originate from disharmony rather than simply being a disease of the body, and wellness can be achieved by restoring emotional and spiritual balance, in addition to the treatment of a physical ailment.36) This differs from the common western practice of focusing on the individual in isolation, outside of the individual’s place in society or in connection to the land, animal, and spirit worlds. In a study of Inuit women’s perceptions of pollution, Egan found that women identified pollution of the land as linked to mental health and wellness in the community. From the perspective of the study participants, changing relationships with the land carried over into changing relationships in the community and substance use, ultimately affecting the health of the community overall.37)
The concept of relationships38) is essential to the Indigenous worldview, which is rarely discussed in the biomedical healthcare system. Supporting the relationships between patients and their health care providers is as important in achieving wellness as supporting and understanding the relationship between patients and their broader societal context. In Southcentral Alaska, for example, the “Nuka System of Care” is the name given to the health care system which was created, and is managed and owned by Alaska Native people to achieve physical, mental, emotional and spiritual wellness.39) Nuka is an Alaska Native word used for strong, giant structures, and living things. The relationship-based Nuka System of Care is comprised of organizational strategies and processes; medical, behavioral, dental, and traditional practices; and supportive infrastructure which work together to support wellness. By putting relationships at the forefront of what they do and how they do it, the Nuka System was designed to continue to develop and improve for future generations.40) The Nuka System is a recipient of the Malcolm Baldridge Quality Award, given to US companies that have successfully implemented quality-management systems. The Nuka System of Care demonstrated a decrease in emergency room visits after their system transformation – 36% from 2000 to 2015. In addition, primary care visits continue to decrease – a 25% decrease from 2008 to 2015. By contributing to the overall health of the population, the Southcentral Foundation’s Nuka System of Care has slowed health care spending. Between 2004 and 2009, annual per capita spending on hospital services grew by only 7% while primary care spending remained below the national index. The organization also reports a 95% employee satisfaction rate and a 93% customer-owner satisfaction rate.
Inuktitut Concepts to Inform a Health Care Model in Nunavut
In Inuktitut, several concepts convey the rich wellness perspective of Inuit. These include, but are not limited to, the Inuit concepts of Inuuqatigiittiarniq (being respectful of all people), Unikkaaqatigiinniq (storytelling), Pittiarniq (being kind and good), Inuusiqatigiinniq (the way of being a person) and Piliriqatigiinniq (working together for the common good).
Inuuqatigiittiarniq: Positive and Respectful Relationships
Inuuqatigiittiarniq is the Inuit concept of respecting and caring for others, as well as building positive relationships. When each person considers their relationships with others and behaves in ways that build this relationship, they build strength. This strength is built in themselves, in others, and together as a community. This concept is foundational to Inuit ways of being. In the health context, one part of building and fostering respectful relationships is clearly articulating one’s intentions and motivations. Health care professionals therefore need to be reflexive and be prepared to answer the questions that community members will inevitably ask them: Who are you? Where are you from? Who is your family? What are you doing here? What will happen to the knowledge that I share with you? How can we learn from each other? A commitment to an approach that values the relationships between the health care professionals as system actors and patients as system users could help improve the overall efficacy of the system, because it is based on the values of the people it is designed to serve.
Unikkaaqatigiinniq: Storytelling
Unikkaaqatigiinniq is the Inuit concept related to storytelling, the power of stories, and the role of stories in Inuit ways of being. In an Indigenous context, stories are methodologically congruent with traditional knowledge or knowledge belonging to people from whom the stories originate.41) Inuit have a rich oral history and culture, which has existed for thousands of years. The telling of stories is an ancient tradition for sharing knowledge, communicating values, morals, skills, histories, legends, and artistry, which still exists today. It is a critical aspect of the Inuit way of life and ways of knowing and allows respondents to share personal experiences without breaking cultural rules related to confidentiality, gossip, or humility. In a study of health determinants for Inuit women in Nunavut, participants drew upon examples and stories from the community to illustrate points about important health issues, such as trauma, family support, and the bonds that bring people together. This further highlighted aspects of the health context involving the community, society, education, and cultural identity.42) Although some knowledge or practices may be disappearing, the use of stories to effectively communicate information remains part of life. It is for this reason that the recognition of the power of stories is particularly important in the context of Inuit health.
Pittiarniq: Being Good
Pittiarniq is the Inuit concept of “being good”, which can mean being ‘good’ in a philosophical and moral sense but also in terms of action such as good behavior (i.e. in the case of the behavior of children). In Inuktitut, two terms have been discussed in the context of ethical conduct in a health or research setting. The first, shared by McGrath, is Pittiaq-, which is related to “being good, kind, or well; doing good or rightly”.43) McGrath argued that the term Pittiaq– refers to both technical and moral excellence. The essence of medical ethics can be reduced to foundational questions: Are our actions good for a patient or good for ourselves? Are we doing good? What does it mean to do good? Without knowledge or experience of Inuit societal values, medical professionals from outside of the culture and epistemology interpret doing/being good (ethics) based on their own worldviews and assumptions about what “good” is.44) Although well-intended, those decisions can have a range of negative impacts on their particular interactions with patients or even on Inuit society in general.45) One example is in the case of sharing bad news, where some clinicians feel the patient should hear the news alone to protect their privacy, whereas the idea of family, connections, and relationships is central in Inuit communities and isolation from family at such a time would be ethically incongruent with community values.
The second term is Inuuqatigiittiarniq, which is related to the concept of being respectful of others. Both terms refer to behavior—that one’s actions are reflective of one’s intention to do good. In doing so, one will be respectful of other people and the relationships between and among the facets of health care and practice. Above all, everyone must be treated with respect, appreciation, and dignity.46) A commitment to a healthcare approach that is mindful of and focuses on Inuit context, knowledge, questions, ethics, and perspectives is an integral part of cultivating a health system rooted in reciprocity and respect.
Inuusiqatigiinniq: The Way of Being a Person
Inuusiqatiginniq is the Inuktitut concept of “the way of being a person.” It can have different meanings in different contexts and, in general, is the term used to convey a holistic view of wellness. Holistic caring and healing models aim to treat the whole person, not just the illness in isolation, and take into account the environmental context, behaviors, and relationships, as well as multiple other factors, with the intent of offering a wide range of solutions to improve one’s health.47) Holistic caring and healing practices have been promoted widely by Indigenous groups, but have not featured prominently in practice.48) In 2014, the World Health Organization (WHO) launched a strategy for improving the integration of traditional and Indigenous medical perspectives and medicines into health care approaches. Approaches including health services and systems, traditional and complementary medicine products, practices, and practitioners.49)
These concepts underscore the right of all Indigenous peoples to construct a health system in accordance with self-determined definitions of what contributes to wellness and how to reach that goal over the life spectrum.
Piliriqatigiinniq: Together for the Common Good
Piliriqatigiinniq is the concept for working in a collaborative way for the common good. Multi-disciplinary collaboration strengthens health promoting programs, fosters greater sharing of knowledge among decision-makers, and promotes implementation of promising practices and policies. The Qaujigiartiit Health Research Center50) developed a model for health research, which is based on a multi-sectoral approach to developing and implementing projects. This model was developed in response to the community-identified need for health data and health interventions, which address topics of concern to Nunavummiut. Through this model, information is collected, analyzed, and disseminated in a holistic and collaborative way. The Piliriqatigiinniq model is a representation of the web of relationships individuals have with each other and is built upon the principle that anyone can be involved in health research in some capacity, if all are working for the common good. The model serves as a reminder to look beyond the scope of what is commonly defined as health and research to include knowledge holders and stakeholders from other disciplines and walks of life.
Conclusion
Health care systems can and should mirror the values of the people they serve. In Nunavut, such systems should promote health care models that are grounded in Inuit ways of knowing and understanding wellness. Such models are a critical part of the on-going self-determination processes for Indigenous communities. Truly understanding and taking action on the health challenges experienced in northern communities requires us to be critical of the models that are conventionally used, to challenge the dominant narratives on the origins of health inequities in our communities, and design systems that reflect our worldview.
Dr. Gwen Healey was born and raised in Iqaluit, Nunavut and is currently the Executive and Scientific Director of the Qaujigiartiit Health Research Centre in Iqaluit. Drawing upon existing community strengths and resources, and strengthening capacity to conduct research in the North, is the key to addressing a number of health concerns presently and over the coming years.

This is a condensed version of the article ‘Digging sustainability: scaling and sectoring of sovereignty in Greenland and Nunavut mining discourses’, recently published in the anthology The Politics of Sustainability in the Arctic: Reconfiguring Identity, Time and Space.
The book sets out a theoretical framework for understanding and analysing sustainability as a political concept, and provides a comprehensive empirical investigation of Arctic sustainability discourses. Presenting a range of case studies from a number of Arctic countries including Greenland, Norway and Canada, the essays in this volume analyse the concept of sustainability and how actors are employing and contesting this concept in specific regions within the Arctic. In doing so, the book demonstrates how sustainability is being given new meanings in the postcolonial Arctic and what the political implications are for postcoloniality, nature, and development more broadly. Beyond those interested in the Arctic, this book will also be of great value to students and scholars of sustainability, sustainable development, identity and environmental politics.

Sustainable Arctic Mining? A Comparative Analysis of Greenland and Nunavut Mining Discourses
The question of whether or not to mine is often placed center-stage in discussions about rights and resources in the Arctic. Some primarily perceive mining as the key to a better economy, while others put greater emphasis on the possible threat to nature. Both sides do, however, insist that the concept of sustainability is inevitable to their argument which, on the one hand, unites the conflicting parts, while on the other hand drains the concept of meaning.
In contrast with harvesting, hunting, fishing, and the exploitation of other renewable resources, minerals are non-renewable and, thus, not possible to sustain if simultaneously being extracted. Hence, ‘sustainable mining’ may be perceived as an oxymoron used by those in favor to co-opt and neutralize critique from environmentalists.1) Through other lenses, it may instead be a sign of environmental, economic, and social responsibility in a capitalist world where development is imperative. The three responsibilities are, however, seldom weighed equally and it is in these nuances that the political becomes observable.
In Greenland and Nunavut, opportunities and possible threats related to mining often give rise to public attention and debate about what the perfect future should look like. Some highlight the importance of preservation (sustaining), while others emphasise the possibilities that change (development) may bring. This activates different and occasionally conflicting perceptions of what the collective identity entails, how mining may affect local standards of living, and, sometimes, how it relates to regional and global concerns and movements.
By comparing the Greenland and the Nunavut mining discourses – as articulated in the official strategies and in relation to the projects in Citronen Fiord and Mary River – this article investigates what kind of meaning is ascribed to the concept of sustainability, how priorities are made, and how responsibility is distributed. This is particularly interesting within the Arctic context, where sustainable development has become an omnipresent buzzword2) – particularly prominent in Arctic mining debates3) – and where Nunavut and Greenland as partners in tradition and in transition4) continue to alter the political landscape by gaining more independent voices.
Greenland: mining for a new nation, stretching ‘the local’
In Greenland’s Oil and Mineral Strategy 2014–2018, ‘sustainable development’ abounds: Across 102 pages, the sustainability concept is mentioned 37 times, and two chapters (2.5 and 7) are dedicated to explaining how the broad sense of ‘sustainable development’ – as defined by the World Commission on Environment and Development (WCED) in 1987 – is the guiding principle for developing the vast mineral resources with careful environmental, economic, and social considerations.
Much importance is attached to the imagined future mineral exploitation, which is not merely framed as a single significant business opportunity, but as a general development of the whole country that will “involve an adjustment of our entire way of organizing society”.5) The Government of Greenland “believes that it is important that all of us contribute to a sustainable development of the area of mineral resources activities”,6) and in its aim to actively involve the broader public, a popularized version of the strategy has subsequently been distributed.7)
The responsibility for making this development sustainable is, thus, not limited to the politicians, the mining companies, or the individual citizens, but instead everyone is expected to partake as stakeholders in this national endeavor. As such, the strategy discursively places all potential mining projects in Greenland on the national scale, while making a diffuse and encompassing ‘all of us’ responsible for fulfilling its unredeemed potential. While this is the case in the national strategy – which per definition is, exactly, national in its scope – it is necessary to dig deeper into the consultation processes of individual projects to get a more nuanced understanding of who is made responsible for what, and on which scale.
The case of Citronen Fiord and the ‘flexibility’ towards independence
One of the strategy’s six prioritized projects is the proposed zinc and lead mine in Citronen Fiord, which the Australian company Ironbark has the license to exploit. The project is located in the national park, where no one but a couple of handfuls of Danish servicemen and a few polar scientists live. Hence, there is no obvious local place to conduct public hearings, which is why Ironbark, the relevant ministers, and civil servants visited seven towns in Greenland’s four municipalities to engage in a dialogue with the public. The selected towns were (attendees/population): Nuuk (30/17,600), Kangerlussuaq (8/500), Ilulissat (8/4,555), Sisimiut (30/5,414), Qaqortoq (?/3,084), Tasiilaq (100/2,010), and Qaanaaq (200/623) of which the latter two were given special attention because they are nearest Citronen Fiord.
Though their ‘proximity’ is limited to approximately 2,000km to the south and 1,000km to the west, respectively, the two towns were discursively constructed as the local scale, even if the immediate economic impact will be abroad in Longyearbyen, Svalbard, from where most air transportation for the proposed mine will arrive, and Akureyri, Iceland, which is expected to be the port of departure for most shipping.8) If environmental concerns had been the decisive optic for determining the local scale, Svalbard could also have been a relevant place to conduct public hearings, as it is located less than 1,000km east of Citronen Fiord.
During the hearings, environmental concerns were almost entirely articulated in relation to the local and national scales, where the possible risk to marine mammals and fishes constituted the greatest worry primarily because they are the main ingredients in traditional Greenlandic food, at the core of Greenlandic culture.9) This reflects the idea, promoted by the then coalition government, that “[t]he sustainability principle is a Greenlandic invention where the first provisions on sustainable exploitation of animals were formulated in the Thule Laws, and these principles must be upheld and honored”.10)
While the sustainability concept articulated in the Thule Laws points to the importance of environmental and social preservation, the communication regarding Citronen Fiord generally puts greater emphasis on development and economic gain, echoing the decision not to sign the Paris Agreement,11) as the Citronen Fiord mine alone is expected to cause a 20 per cent increase in Greenland’s current total CO2 emissions (cf. Qujaukitsoq at public hearing in Sisimiut). Via the Environmental Impact Assessment – made in the process prior to the IBA – the mining company and respective authorities scrutinise how to mitigate the potential environmental impacts, but the responsibility for ultimately doing so is placed on the shoulders of the mining companies – a decision characterised as ‘pioneering’ in the strategy.12)
The prioritization is clear: mining must be realized in order to sustain the national economy even though it may have some negative environmental impacts. As put by then Minister for Finance, Energy, and Foreign Affairs, Vittus Qujaukitsoq from the social democratic party Siumut, when interviewed about why mining is now allowed in Citronen Fiord despite the past ban on any economic activities in the area: “The national park is the most pristine part of our country, and it is important for all animal and plant life. But we have to be flexible if new business opportunities arise”.13) Such flexibility is legitimized by the overall goal of future independence, which is dependent on new significant sources of income. This was repeatedly emphasized by Qujaukitsoq, who stated at the public hearing in Ilulissat: “We will never be independent if we leave our resources untouched”, and by then Minister for Business, Labour, and Trade, Randi Vestergaard Evaldsen from the social liberal party Demokraatit, who argued at the public hearing in Qaqortoq that “by giving companies the opportunity to establish mining projects we are paving the way towards independence”.
One displeased citizen protested that “I feel Greenland is just being sold”,(cf. public hearing in Tasiilaq) and another asked, “Could we postpone such projects until Greenland has been declared independent? We hear about many projects which are never being realized” (cf. public hearing in Iulissat). However, the dominant storyline throughout the hearings was that the Citronen Fiord mine and other similar proposed projects must be established for the benefit of fulfilling the Greenlandic ambition of independence.
Nunavut: social license to drill towards devolution
In Nunavut’s mining strategy, Parnautit: A Foundation for the Future, the sustainability concept is mentioned 20 times across 64 pages, often in central parts of the strategy. The first page states that the strategy serves as: “the plan of the Government of Nunavut to create opportunities for the future self-reliance of Nunavut and Nunavummiut through the sustainable development of our mineral resources. It is intended to guide that development in the period leading up to the devolution of management responsibilities for lands and resources from the federal government”.14)
As in Greenland, mining is ascribed much importance as a key element to increased self-determination, but while the words used in the neighboring mining discourse when describing Greenland’s present and future status are ‘country’ and ‘independence’, the terminology used in Nunavut is instead ‘territory’ and ‘devolution’. This reflects the different directions of their respective postcolonial developments, while simultaneously indicating that both governments perceive mining as the most likely economic contributor to increased autonomy.
Sustaining the territorial economy is at the core of Nunavut’s official mining discourse, but unlike the ‘flexibility’ that Minister Qujaukitsoq pleaded for when explaining the necessity of allowing mining in Greenland’s national park, environmental concerns are more explicitly addressed in Nunavut. After stating that “Nunavut’s future economic viability, and the improvement of the quality of life of Nunavummiut, will depend on the development of these known and yet to be discovered resources”,15) the strategy emphasises that “Nunavut’s arctic environment is fragile, however, and Nunavummiut will not tolerate development that has unacceptable environmental impacts”.16)
The line between acceptable and unacceptable is not further explained, but mining companies are advised to pay special attention to public opinion, as the social license is inevitable for a successful operation. The social license is obtained through involving the local community by, for example, hiring local workers which can benefit social sustainability, and through minimising the environmental impact by “treating their project as a ‘temporary use of the land’, and fully rehabilitating the site for other uses after mining or exploration is complete”.17) Thus, the environmental and social sectors are also given high priority in the assessment of how a potential mine may contribute to the development of all of Nunavut and the individual local communities.
The case of Mary River and the use of IQ
It may be a delicate balancing act to sustain both the environment, the economy, and the social sector when mining. This is acknowledged by the Government of Nunavut, which clearly expresses that “[i]nevitably, the push towards development of mineral resources and the need for environmental protection will create conflicts”.18) In this light, a Planning Commission is currently working on a comprehensive Land Use Plan in order to “proactively resolve potential conflicts between mineral exploration parties requiring access to land, and wildlife and community uses”.19) While this initiative presents a broader scope, including sectors other than mining, the individual projects aim at proactively settling disagreements via public hearings in the areas deemed most affected by the proposed mining activity.
In the case of the Mary River iron mine, the five communities of Igloolik (155km to the mine), Pond Inlet (160km), Hall Beach (192km), Arctic Bay (280km), and Clyde River (415km) were pointed out as the places in the ‘immediate vicinity’ with ‘long term social, economic and environmental ties to the proposed ERP [Early Revenue Phase] area’.20) When a place is labelled as being in the ‘immediate vicinity’, it also means that its citizens have better chances of being employed in or in relation to the mine. This was often highlighted by the local representatives as the main reason why they are ultimately in favour of the project despite accompanying potential risks – such as negative environmental impacts especially connected to shipping of the iron, abusive use of alcohol and drugs,21) and other related consequences known from similar fly-in fly-out camp environments.22)
In the North Baffin region where Mary River is located, 94 per cent of the population are Inuit, and Inuktitut is the prevalent language with some monolingual speakers, ranging from 6 per cent in Hall Beach to 24 per cent in Igloolik.23) The ethnic majority and respect for Inuit traditions are central in the Nunavut mining discourse, mirrored in the name of the IBA, which has an extra I indicating that it is, indeed, an Inuit Impact Benefit Agreement (IIBA).
In Nunavut’s official mining strategy and in the Land Use Plan, the dominating WCED understanding of sustainable development is particularly visible, but when Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit – meaning ‘Inuit knowledge’ and often abbreviated ‘IQ’ – is included, the hegemonic perception is contested: “[s]ustainable development is not a fixed understanding. As communities change, their relationship with the land and with each other will continue to develop and evolve”.24)
Despite this contestation, the Inuktitut translation of ‘sustainable’ is quite clear. Ikupik, as it is called, means “to conserve and not take all at once; what is brought in from a hunt. Everyone takes a piece for their family, ensuring there is enough to go around”.25) As in the Thule Laws, the sustainability principle is closely linked to food security and social sustainability through covering the basic needs of the local community. This definition makes sense for hunting and harvesting of renewable resources, but in the case of non-renewable minerals this traditional understanding is open to interpretation – and even more so when adding the perception that the concept is in flux.
During the hearings, neither the traditional Inuit definition nor the contestation of the hegemonic WCED understanding were articulated. Instead, utterances about sustainability usually referred to one particular sector, where local representatives emphasise the importance of sustaining the local communities, and the official authorities put more weight on the sector closest to their respective area of responsibility. In this way, the executive director of the Nunavut Planning Commission, Sharon Ehaloak, encouraged economic sustainable development,26) and the environmental specialist of Parks Canada, Allison Stoddart, only talked about environmental sustainability,27) while Karen Costello – the resource director of the Nunavut Office of Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development – said that her mandate is to “improve social and economic well-being and develop healthier, more sustainable communities”.28)
While they all agree that if the mine should be established it needs to be in a sustainable manner, the nuances of the different prioritized sectors demonstrate how they may represent different political agendas. Consequently, a compromise needs to be found to balance these different considerations in the development of Nunavut – a development which is predominantly human-centered, as all parts in favor of the mine agree that economic gain should benefit some size of a social entity; the individual, the community, the company, the territory, and the nation.
Conclusion
Nunavut’s and Greenland’s postcolonial developments have been closely related to the acquisition of the right to exploit their own mineral resources. In Greenland, this parallel process seems to continue, while mining in Nunavut is subject to undisguised conflicts between primarily economic and environmental priorities, proactively addressed by the authorities in their aim to direct the territory towards a future where all Nunavummiut feel at home.
In both cases, the social sustainability is given high priority. While hunting traditions are emphasized as central to each respective collective identity – which in Nunavut’s case unquestionably equals an Inuit identity – the striving for independence is the overarching goal legitimizing mining in Greenland’s national park, despite a past ban on any economic activities in the area. In Nunavut, more attention is ascribed to the local community that shall benefit economically and socially, while ‘the national’ is a label exclusively reserved for the Canadian Federation. Instead, Nunavut is described as a territory that loyally respects Canada’s sovereignty, even though decisions such as the 2016 moratorium on hydrocarbon exploitation in the North American Arctic waters was signed without prior consultation with the territorial governments.
The analyses show how sovereignty is closely connected to the question of who gets to decide what to sustain, which is particularly visible in the cases of Nunavut and Greenland, where exploitation of their natural resources is perceived as a potential core contributor to a more viable economy and increased self-determination. The concept of sustainability is, to some degree, contested by Indigenous definitions, but in both discourses the WCED’s 1987 description of sustainable development is generally the main point of reference, hence reproducing the hegemonic perception. The defining nuances rendering visible how priorities are made, responsibilities are distributed, and what consequences these decisions may have in the future are, however, found in the weighing of different scales and sectors, as one often takes precedence over the others. In Greenland, this weight is primarily put on the national economy, while the Nunavut mining discourse gives more precedence to local social sustainability. These prioritizations do, however, sometimes overlap, causing the spillover of impacts and benefits across sectors and scales.

Iqaluit International Airport, located in the city of Nunavut in Canada, has been expanded and refurbished as a part of the airport’s $298.5m improvement project.
Construction started in July 2014 and the project was completed in August 2017. The project created a greater number of jobs for the people in the Nunavat region.
The airport is owned by the Government of Nunavut (GN) and operated by the Iqaluit International Airport Division Authority.
Iqaluit Airport was opened in the 1940s. The traffic at the airport has been increasing at a rate of 5% per year since 2000. The airport improvement project was initiated to handle the increasing traffic and meet the increasing demands of the passengers.
The project provides economic support and a better transportation network for passengers. The expanded airport can now handle more flights.
The project included construction of a new Air Terminal Building (ATB) and a new Combined Services Building (CSB).
ATB covers an area of 10,000m² and was constructed by widening the main apron, so that more planes can be parked at the apron. It features additional revolving luggage belts, new passenger screening areas, washrooms, a restaurant, a coffee shop and a souvenir shop.
CSB houses fire-fighting vehicles and heavy equipments for runway maintenance. It covers an area of 4,500m².
The airport has an 8,605ft-long and 2,623m-wide asphalt coated runway. The runway is repaved based on Runway End Safety Areas (RESA) measures from both end sides.
A new taxiway is constructed to facilitate the increasing number of passengers. The taxiway Alpha will be reopened after some improvements.
The project also includes improvement and upgrade of the garage and the baggage handling systems, and installation of lighting and electrical systems at the airport.
The Government of Nunavut selected a consortium led by Arctic Infrastructure Partners to design, build, finance, operate and maintain the IIAIP project in July 2013.
The consortium will operate the airport for 30 years under a contract that was signed in September 2013. The consortium includes InfraRed Capital Partners, Bouygues Building Canada, Colas Canada and Winnipeg Airports Authority.
Bouygues Building and Colas jointly managed the design and build aspects for the project. Winnipeg will provide the airport services.
The project model was audited by Operis. Partnerships British Columbia provided consulting services for the project as per an agreement signed in June 2011.
The Government of Harper provided $77.3m for the project under a public-private partnership (P3) in September 2012. The Government of Nunavut contributed about $68.7m for construction while PPP Canada provided funding of $72.8m.

climatechangenunavut,https://www.climatechangenunavut.ca/en/energy/renewable-energy https://www.climatechangenunavut.ca/sites/default/files/3154-315_climate_english_reduced_size_1_0.pdf https://www.climatechangenunavut.ca/en/energy/renewable-energy https://www.climatechangenunavut.ca/en/resources ,"On one hand, diesel generators and fossil fuel-based home heating are reliable and well-established technologies that have a relatively low up-front cost to install. On the other hand, fossil fuels are becoming ever more expensive, they are responsible for air pollution, greenhouse gases emissions, and fuel spills on the Territory are an ongoing concern. What other options exist?
As the name implies, renewable energy is naturally occurring and self-replenishing. It is way less polluting. On the other hand, some renewable energy technologies are expensive and have yet to be fully commercialized. Further still, technologies such as solar and wind produce energy intermittingly, which means in the absence of effective storage technology, energy is only available during certain times of the day or year. The development of energy storage systems to accompany the renewable energy sources are evolving quickly.
Solar Resources
Solar energy emanates from the sun and approaches the Earth as short-wave electromagnetic radiation. Electromagnetic radiation that reaches the Earth is also described as insolation (incoming solar radiation). This renewable energy source is generally used in two ways: solar photovoltaic (PV) systems and solar thermal systems. Solar PV applications transform solar energy into electricity through the use of PV arrays (e.g., PV solar panels). In solar thermal applications, solar energy is used for heating purposes as it is absorbed by surfaces and materials (e.g., solar thermal panels).
Locations along the Hudson Bay coast in the Kivalliq region receive the highest amount of solar energy in Nunavut. The amount of solar energy that reaches coastal areas of the Kivalliq region is comparable to the amount of solar energy that reaches southern Quebec, much of Ontario, and the Maritimes. The amount of solar energy that reaches the northern half of Nunavut is lower than any other part of Nunavut and Canada. Solar PV applications have demonstrated success in northern jurisdictions. In particular, a PV array at the Arctic College in Iqaluit has delivered electricity since its installation in 1995. The PV array captures up to 20 hours of sunlight per day during the longest days of summer and five hours per day during the darkest days of winter.
Solar thermal applications have also been installed in Nunavut. In 2010, the GN commenced four pilot projects in Iqaluit, including the installation of glycol heating panels that are attached to a heat exchanger in various buildings in Iqaluit such as the Baffin Correction Center, the Young Offenders
The use of solar PV and solar thermal systems results in energy bill savings and reduction in GHGs, although the start-up costs for installing these systems can be high especially because of the cost of transporting equipment to Nunavut.
Wind Resources
Solar energy heats the surface of the Earth unevenly, which results in the formation of air pressure differences between locations. Hotter air rises and cooler air sinks, and the energy flow results in wind. The wind’s energy can be used by windmills to move water or it can be transformed into electricity by wind turbines.
The amount of electricity generated by a wind turbine depends on its size, the wind speed and wind turbine height (wind speed is generally higher at elevations farther from the ground surface). Wind speed is variable and so too is the production of electricity by wind turbines. Higher wind speeds generally result in a higher output of electricity, though wind turbines will not function at wind speeds that exceed its capacity. The installation and operation of wind turbines is complex in the north due to environmental factors such as cold temperature and permafrost. Losses in efficiency occur in wind-diesel hybrid systems as a result of wind variability. Wind systems are generally installed as wind-diesel hybrids in remote communities so the diesel generators can compensate for wind speed variability. The variability of wind is what limits how much wind can be safely integrated into the electricity system. Too much variability in electricity from wind makes the electricity system unstable and unreliable.
Three wind energy pilot projects have been attempted in Nunavut, all of which were diesel grid connected. One turbine was installed in Cambridge Bay in 1994 and operated until 1999. Two turbines operated in Kugluktuk from 1997 to 2002. One turbine in Rankin Inlet operated from 2000 to 2001. The Rankin Inlet turbine was refurbished in October 2008 but was ultimately decommissioned. The Nunavut wind projects experienced equipment malfunctions, issues with routine maintenance, and financial restrictions. The technology is quickly evolving, new wind turbine models have proven to work well in arctic conditions.
Wind speeds in Nunavut have been modeled in the Canadian Wind Energy Atlas. Cape Dorset, Arviat and Rankin Inlet are among the communities that have high wind resources (i.e., wind speed). Communities with moderate wind resources include Cambridge Bay, Kugaaruk and Resolute Bay. Iqaluit, Coral Harbour and Kugluktuk are among the communities that have the lowest wind resources. The Canadian Wind Energy Atlas is based on wind speed data collected at Nunavut airports, not by wind monitoring towers. Wind monitoring towers will likely be installed at potential wind project sites before committing to a development since modeled data is not as reliable as real data.
Hydro Resources
The energy in flowing water can be transformed into electricity by directing the flow of water to pass through turbines. The turbines are connected to electrical generators, such that the movement of water causes the turbines to rotate, which results in the production of electricity.
There are two types of systems that can be used in hydroelectric power plants: a “run-of-river” system or a “storage” (dam) system (see the Ocean resources below for the description of this distinct hydrological resource). A run-of-river system contains turbines that are situated in rivers that are sufficiently steep. Storage systems involve the construction of dams to create reservoirs of water allowing for control of water flow. Small run-of-river hydropower systems generally have lower environmental effects than storage systems but they also have more maintenance requirements. A run-of-river system in the Arctic has to be installed in a river that does not freeze to the bottom during winter to allow for year-round operation or they would have to be removed in winter creating significant additional operating costs. Storage type hydroelectric power plants can produce electricity year-round in Arctic conditions if water reservoirs are maintained at operational levels.
Storage and run-of-river systems have operated successfully in northern jurisdictions such as the NWT, Yukon and Alaska. Potential hydroelectric sites have been identified in Nunavut. In particular, assessments of hydroelectric potential have been completed for various locations near Iqaluit and in the Kivalliq region. In the Kivalliq, many potential sites are far away from community centers resulting in an increase in development costs. The demand for electricity in many Nunavut communities is too low to economically justify hydroelectric development, which has left hydroelectric resources underdeveloped in Nunavut. However if significant mining development occurs there may be opportunities to economically develop these resources in the future. Further study of potential hydroelectric development in the Kitikmeot is needed. Near Iqaluit, the Armshow River Long and the Jaynes Inlet sites have been identified as potential hydroelectric developments.
Residual Heat Resources
Residual heat refers to energy that escapes as heat, which is produced by friction between moving parts of a generator, instead of being converted into electrical energy. One way in which residual heat produced by diesel generators can be recovered is in district heat systems. District heat systems are comprised of three components: diesel generator, distribution piping system, and energy transfer stations. Heat exchangers and exhaust heat recovery systems recover heat energy from the diesel generator. The distribution piping system distributes the captured heat energy to buildings connected by insulated distribution pipes. Energy transfer stations control, measure and transfer heat energy to each connected building. The use of residual heat decreases fossil fuel consumption and GHG emissions by providing heat energy to buildings that would otherwise be heated by oil transported to the site. Residual heat recovery is one type of alternative energy that is currently used by QEC in several Nunavut communities. Funding for residual heat recovery systems has been made available by various government agencies for diesel power plants in Nunavut. QEC has plans to expand existing residual heat systems and establish new residual heat systems in other Nunavut communities. Heat recovery is an effective way to reduce diesel consumption by improving generator efficiency from 30% to 80%. (INAC, 2018)
Waste Material Resources
Combustible industrial and domestic (household) waste materials normally end up in landfills but, technically, they could be incinerated in Waste-to-Energy (WTE) plants to produce electricity and / or heat. The heat produced by waste incinerators can be used to generate steam, which drives turbines to produce electricity or is distributed to buildings connected to a district heating system. WTE plants have demonstrated success in generating electricity and / or heat in northern jurisdictions (for example in Greenland). However, the capital funds needed to build the plant could be an obstacle.
Biofuel Resources
Biofuels can be produced from oils, fats and sugars derived from plants and animals. There is no agricultural activity in Nunavut, therefore, plants such as canola and soybeans that are used to produce biofuels would have to be imported. Importing plants is not a viable renewable substitute for fossil fuels.
Biofuel programs using fish waste (offal) have demonstrated success in remote communities (e.g., in Alaska) and in the Energy Strategy the GN has expressed interest in exploring the possibility of developing similar programs in Nunavut. The Nunavut fishing industry processes Arctic char and some Greenland halibut. Fish are made commercially available through four fish processing plants. One plant also processes marine mammals (seals and whales). Only two of the four fish processing plants in Nunavut purchase whole fish (i.e., with guts intact) but do so only in the winter months. During the summer, purchased fish have been already gutted by the harvester. The fish by-products produced in fish processing plants are limited to mostly frames (which are supplied to local dog owners) and a small amount of offal (which is discarded).
However, there are concerns that the purchase of marine mammals for biofuel production could exceed the food price. This could also impact food security.
Ocean Resources
Ocean energy is produced in various forms (e.g., from tidal currents, wave energy, ocean thermal energy and salt gradient energy). Ocean energy technology is relatively new and only tidal current energy (tidal energy) technology has been applied on commercial scales. There is worldwide interest in tidal energy because tidal energy resources are up to 50 times as dense as wind resources and are 100 times more efficient than solar photovoltaic (PV) resources. The advantage of using tidal currents to produce electricity is their predictability and persistence. Presently, there are two leading ways to convert tidal energy into electrical energy: tidal barrages and in-stream turbines. Tidal barrages are similar in concept to hydroelectric dams, where water is stored and directed through turbines to generate electricity. In-stream tidal turbines are analogous to wind turbines in that turbines are designed to utilize existing current flows without necessarily controlling them.
There are various in-stream tidal turbine models, but all follow the same principle; using the flow of underwater tides to rotate a turbine. In-stream turbines are submerged and are usually installed onto the seafloor. In-stream turbine technology is currently being investigated in Canada (e.g., British Columbia and Nova Scotia), the United States (e.g., Alaska), and Europe (e.g., Ireland and Scotland).
The potential tidal current energy of Nunavut is estimated to be highest in Canada. Many sites with tidal energy potential are in remote parts of Nunavut and it may not be feasible to explore the development of tidal energy in these areas. In-stream turbines are expensive and investing in the development of tidal energy may be risky especially when considering Arctic conditions. There is potential for tidal energy development in Frobisher Bay, where tides are among the highest in Canada. In-stream turbines in Frobisher Bay could supply electricity for Iqaluit, where population numbers and electricity demand may be at high enough levels to support the high cost of tidal energy development.
Modeling studies of tidal currents and tidal energy in Frobisher Bay are recommended.
Nuclear Power
Large-scale nuclear power generation may be suitable for populated areas of southern Canada, but Nunavut’s comparatively lower power demands and decentralized habitation patterns could make the use of smaller-scale nuclear reactors (also referred to as “nuclear batteries”) more practical.
Small scale nuclear units are being developed and could be an alternative to fossil fuel electricity generation in northern, remote communities, and development sites. These small nuclear energy systems can be prebuilt and delivered to the site. They consist of modular units and are therefore are easy to transport. Because these reactor systems are modular and can be designed to meet a community’s energy needs (e.g., using only one unit or bundling several reactors together for larger power demands). These types of reactors have not yet been approved for use in Canada and are at the pre-commercialization stage. Small-scale nuclear reactors are currently operating in Bilibino, Siberia (Russia) where four reactors supply power to the remote community of 4,500 residents.
However, radioactive leaks, the transportation of radioactive materials, and safe operation and decommissioning processes are issues that have been identified as important health and environmental risks. .  . On one hand, diesel generators and fossil fuel-based home heating are reliable and well-established technologies that have a relatively low up-front cost to install. On the other hand, fossil fuels are becoming ever more expensive, they are responsible for air pollution, greenhouse gases emissions, and fuel spills on the Territory are an ongoing concern.

Two turbines operated in Kugluktuk from 1997 to 2002. One turbine in Rankin Inlet operated from 2000 to 2001. The Rankin Inlet turbine was refurbished in October 2008 but was ultimately decommissioned. The Nunavut wind projects experienced equipment malfunctions, issues with routine maintenance, and financial restrictions. The technology is quickly evolving, new wind turbine models have proven to work well in arctic conditions.
Wind speeds in Nunavut have been modeled in the Canadian Wind Energy Atlas. Cape Dorset, Arviat and Rankin Inlet are among the communities that have high wind resources (i.e., wind speed). Communities with moderate wind resources include Cambridge Bay, Kugaaruk and Resolute Bay. Iqaluit, Coral Harbour and Kugluktuk are among the communities that have the lowest wind resources. The Canadian Wind Energy Atlas is based on wind speed data collected at Nunavut airports, not by wind monitoring towers. Wind monitoring towers will likely be installed at potential wind project sites before committing to a development since modeled data is not as reliable as real data.
Hydro Resources
The energy in flowing water can be transformed into electricity by directing the flow of water to pass through turbines. The turbines are connected to electrical generators, such that the movement of water causes the turbines to rotate, which results in the production of electricity.
There are two types of systems that can be used in hydroelectric power plants: a “run-of-river” system or a “storage” (dam) system (see the Ocean resources below for the description of this distinct hydrological resource). A run-of-river system contains turbines that are situated in rivers that are sufficiently steep. Storage systems involve the construction of dams to create reservoirs of water allowing for control of water flow. Small run-of-river hydropower systems generally have lower environmental effects than storage systems but they also have more maintenance requirements. A run-of-river system in the Arctic has to be installed in a river that does not freeze to the bottom during winter to allow for year-round operation or they would have to be removed in winter creating significant additional operating costs. Storage type hydroelectric power plants can produce electricity year-round in Arctic conditions if water reservoirs are maintained at operational levels.
Storage and run-of-river systems have operated successfully in northern jurisdictions such as the NWT, Yukon and Alaska. Potential hydroelectric sites have been identified in Nunavut. In particular, assessments of hydroelectric potential have been completed for various locations near Iqaluit and in the Kivalliq region. In the Kivalliq, many potential sites are far away from community centers resulting in an increase in development costs. The demand for electricity in many Nunavut communities is too low to economically justify hydroelectric development, which has left hydroelectric resources underdeveloped in Nunavut. However if significant mining development occurs there may be opportunities to economically develop these resources in the future. Further study of potential hydroelectric development in the Kitikmeot is needed. Near Iqaluit, the Armshow River Long and the Jaynes Inlet sites have been identified as potential hydroelectric developments.
Residual Heat Resources
Residual heat refers to energy that escapes as heat, which is produced by friction between moving parts of a generator, instead of being converted into electrical energy. One way in which residual heat produced by diesel generators can be recovered is in district heat systems. District heat systems are comprised of three components: diesel generator, distribution piping system, and energy transfer stations. Heat exchangers and exhaust heat recovery systems recover heat energy from the diesel generator. The distribution piping system distributes the captured heat energy to buildings connected by insulated distribution pipes. Energy transfer stations control, measure and transfer heat energy to each connected building. The use of residual heat decreases fossil fuel consumption and GHG emissions by providing heat energy to buildings that would otherwise be heated by oil transported to the site. Residual heat recovery is one type of alternative energy that is currently used by QEC in several Nunavut communities. Funding for residual heat recovery systems has been made available by various government agencies for diesel power plants in Nunavut. QEC has plans to expand existing residual heat systems and establish new residual heat systems in other Nunavut communities. Heat recovery is an effective way to reduce diesel consumption by improving generator efficiency from 30% to 80%. (INAC, 2018)
Waste Material Resources
Combustible industrial and domestic (household) waste materials normally end up in landfills but, technically, they could be incinerated in Waste-to-Energy (WTE) plants to produce electricity and / or heat. The heat produced by waste incinerators can be used to generate steam, which drives turbines to produce electricity or is distributed to buildings connected to a district heating system. WTE plants have demonstrated success in generating electricity and / or heat in northern jurisdictions (for example in Greenland). However, the capital funds needed to build the plant could be an obstacle.
Biofuel Resources
Biofuels can be produced from oils, fats and sugars derived from plants and animals. There is no agricultural activity in Nunavut, therefore, plants such as canola and soybeans that are used to produce biofuels would have to be imported. Importing plants is not a viable renewable substitute for fossil fuels.
Biofuel programs using fish waste (offal) have demonstrated success in remote communities (e.g., in Alaska) and in the Energy Strategy the GN has expressed interest in exploring the possibility of developing similar programs in Nunavut. The Nunavut fishing industry processes Arctic char and some Greenland halibut. Fish are made commercially available through four fish processing plants. One plant also processes marine mammals (seals and whales). Only two of the four fish processing plants in Nunavut purchase whole fish (i.e., with guts intact) but do so only in the winter months. During the summer, purchased fish have been already gutted by the harvester. The fish by-products produced in fish processing plants are limited to mostly frames (which are supplied to local dog owners) and a small amount of offal (which is discarded).
However, there are concerns that the purchase of marine mammals for biofuel production could exceed the food price. This could also impact food security.
Ocean Resources
Ocean energy is produced in various forms (e.g., from tidal currents, wave energy, ocean thermal energy and salt gradient energy). Ocean energy technology is relatively new and only tidal current energy (tidal energy) technology has been applied on commercial scales. There is worldwide interest in tidal energy because tidal energy resources are up to 50 times as dense as wind resources and are 100 times more efficient than solar photovoltaic (PV) resources. The advantage of using tidal currents to produce electricity is their predictability and persistence. Presently, there are two leading ways to convert tidal energy into electrical energy: tidal barrages and in-stream turbines. Tidal barrages are similar in concept to hydroelectric dams, where water is stored and directed through turbines to generate electricity. In-stream tidal turbines are analogous to wind turbines in that turbines are designed to utilize existing current flows without necessarily controlling them.
There are various in-stream tidal turbine models, but all follow the same principle; using the flow of underwater tides to rotate a turbine. In-stream turbines are submerged and are usually installed onto the seafloor. In-stream turbine technology is currently being investigated in Canada (e.g., British Columbia and Nova Scotia), the United States (e.g., Alaska), and Europe (e.g., Ireland and Scotland).
The potential tidal current energy of Nunavut is estimated to be highest in Canada. Many sites with tidal energy potential are in remote parts of Nunavut and it may not be feasible to explore the development of tidal energy in these areas. In-stream turbines are expensive and investing in the development of tidal energy may be risky especially when considering Arctic conditions. There is potential for tidal energy development in Frobisher Bay, where tides are among the highest in Canada. In-stream turbines in Frobisher Bay could supply electricity for Iqaluit, where population numbers and electricity demand may be at high enough levels to support the high cost of tidal energy development.
Modeling studies of tidal currents and tidal energy in Frobisher Bay are recommended.
Nuclear Power
Large-scale nuclear power generation may be suitable for populated areas of southern Canada, but Nunavut’s comparatively lower power demands and decentralized habitation patterns could make the use of smaller-scale nuclear reactors (also referred to as “nuclear batteries”) more practical.
Small scale nuclear units are being developed and could be an alternative to fossil fuel electricity generation in northern, remote communities, and development sites. These small nuclear energy systems can be prebuilt and delivered to the site. They consist of modular units and are therefore are easy to transport. Because these reactor systems are modular and can be designed to meet a community’s energy needs (e.g., using only one unit or bundling several reactors together for larger power demands). These types of reactors have not yet been approved for use in Canada and are at the pre-commercialization stage. Small-scale nuclear reactors are currently operating in Bilibino, Siberia (Russia) where four reactors supply power to the remote community of 4,500 residents.
However, radioactive leaks, the transportation of radioactive materials, and safe operation and decommissioning processes are issues that have been identified as important health and environmental risks. . GN Partners
Throughout the Government of Nunavut, there are several departments and territorial corporations that are responsible for energy services throughout the territory. Click the name of each stakeholder to learn more.
Department of Community and Government Services (CGS)
CGS is responsible for managing GN property, government procurement, administering utilities, promoting energy conservation in government facilities, and purchasing petroleum products in bulk. Within CGS there are two primary divisions responsible for energy-related matters: the Technical Services Division and the Petroleum Products Division.
Technical Services Division
The CGS-Technical Services section plays an important role in reducing energy consumption and the use of non-renewable resources in government facilities through the Nunavut Energy Management Program (NEMP).
Petroleum Products Division
The Petroleum Products Division (PPD) is a division of the Government of Nunavut’s Department of Community and Government Services. PPD maintains inventories of petroleum products in all of Nunavut’s communities where no commercial suppliers (e.g. Esso, Shell, etc.) exist. The mandate of PPD is:
A) To purchase, transport, deliver, store, distribute and sell refined petroleum products to residents in all communities of Nunavut in a safe, economic, efficient and reliable manner; and
B) To ensure a continuous supply of refined petroleum products (e.g. gasoline, diesel, Jet A-1, etc.) adequate to meet the current needs of consumers and the future development of Nunavut.
Each summer during the ice-free months, fuel is transported to each community via ocean tanker or tug and barge and is stored in on-shore bulk storage tanks. Locally hired and trained Fuel Delivery Contractors then deliver and sell the products to residents throughout the year.

nunavutqiviut,https://nunavutqiviut.com/pages/about https://nunavutqiviut.com/ https://nunavutqiviut.com/pages/copy-of-qiviut-yarn ,"About
The Nunavut Qiviut Mission is to develop sustainable, imaginative, and beneficial qiviut yarn and fiber art products from our Arctic environment. Nunavut Qiviut supports the traditional Inuit lifestyle of our community.
A Rare Arctic Luxury from a Remote Arctic Business
The coldest, darkest Canadian tundra ecosystems in winter produce the warmest, softest, and most luxurious natural fibres. Many would describe qiviut yarn as the most beautiful material for super-luxury fashion. Imagine basing a business in a remote, unforgiving Arctic environment and designing super-luxury lace yarns and knit accessories for a limited clientele. That business is Nunavut Qiviut.
Nunavut Qiviut is leading the creation of super-luxury yarn and knit accessories from Arctic fibre using sustainable Arctic wildlife. Based in Kugluktuk, Nunavut in Canada, Nunavut Qiviut shares geography with the planet’s largest population of muskox that is managed by the governments of Nunavut and Canada. In the same region are populations of Arctic fox and Arctic hare known globally for their fur that is among the softest and warmest in the world.
Nunavut Qiviut draws upon its social, geographic and scientific legitimacy to create sustainable, authentic, and quality fibre products. The main challenges to the business are its remote location and harsh climate that creates high-cost business conditions and separation from existing and potential customers. Remoteness, however, is also a strength because Nunavut Qiviut has easy access to special fibre resources to produce fascinating Arctic fibre products that create sustainable benefits for the community of Kugluktuk.
Nunavut Qiviut customers demand super-luxury products and understand that rare and legitimate luxuries carry unique challenges. With resolute support of trusted clients, Kugluktuk, and other stakeholders, Nunavut Qiviut has quickly become the leading brand in the niche of super-luxury Arctic fibers. . Luxury Arctic Fibre from Muskox, Arctic Fox & Arctic Hare
Thank you for visiting Nunavut Qiviut. Nunavut Qiviut is the specialist of sustainable qiviut yarn for knitters around the world. Pure Qiviut yarn and Qiviut blend yarn from Muskox, Arctic fox yarn, and Arctic hare yarn is what we make and sell. We also make Muskox qiviut socks, and will also have Muskox qiviut hats available soon. We hope you enjoy our on-line store. . Nunavut Qiviut Yarn
QIVIUT YARN PRODUCTS
Nunavut Qiviut spins yarn from muskox, Arctic fox, and Arctic hare qiviut while experimenting with other unique Arctic fibres. All Arctic fibre supplies are locally sourced and support the traditional lifestyles of the Kugluktuk community. Most yarns listed below are a 2-ply lace, in 1 oz. skeins of approximately 190 yards per ounce. We also make a 3 ply, 2 oz, 267 yards pure Muskox Qiviut Yarn and keep small amounts of it. We also have prime dehaired qiviut available for hand spinners. In the past we produced a 3 ply sock yarn.
MUSKOX QIVIUT LACE YARNS
100% Qiviut Lace Yarn – 100% Qiviut Lace Yarn represents all the best qualities of this magnificent fibre – light, sensuous, and luxuriously soft. 100% Qiviut Lace yarn does not have elasticity like wool and has low abrasive resistance. Don’t waste this rare pure fibre on heels and elbows. 100% Qiviut Lace Yarn is used for knitting accessories such as scarves and cowls. Nunavut Qiviut has 100% prime dehaired qiviut for hand spinners.
Pure qiviut has a light chocolate-brown colour. It is a dark fibre, and dyes darker than the natural base colour. It accepts natural non-metal dyes in deep jewel tones, such as purple, indigo, ruby, moss, blue-green, and midnight colours. It is not possible to produce 100% qiviut yarn in lighter tone colours unless harmful bleaching or metal-based dyes are used, or it is blended with lighter colour fibres. Qiviut in light blue, yellow, or other light tones, is probably not 100% or the fibre has been damaged with bleaches or contains metal-based dyes and the supplier should be questioned!
50/40/10 Qiviut Lace Yarn – This qiviut yarn is made of 50% qiviut, 40% superfine merino and 10% silk. The characteristic qualities of qiviut remain dominant in this blend, but the elasticity of superfine merino is added, along with the strength of silk. Superfine merino and silk are both a light tone, which brightens the base colour of the blend compared to 100% Qiviut Yarn. This blend has the same colours as the 100% Qiviut Lace Yarn, but it is a shade lighter. We also have a teal colour that cannot be made in the 100% qiviut yarn because of the darker starting colour. The 50/40/10% blend is more durable and is often knit into accessories that require fibre memory such as hats, headbands, gloves, and fingerless gloves. An elder in Kugluktuk makes beautiful lace gloves from this blend.
50/50 Qiviut Lace Yarn – This qiviut yarn blend is made from 50% qiviut and 50% silk. In 2018, based on our spinning mills recommendation, Nunavut Qiviut blended equal amounts of pure undyed silk with equal amounts of pure qiviut in either natural or dyed colours. The outcome was a lighter palette of yarn compared to the 50/40/10 Qiviut Yarn with a metallic shimmer. The softness of the qiviut comes through in this yarn and adopts the drape of silk. Nunavut Qiviut is very impressed with the results of knitting the 50/50 Qiviut Yarn into shawls and scarves.
Buyers of our yarn might wonder why 50/50 Qiviut Lace Yarn cost more than half than the cost of 100% Qiviut Lace Yarn. The reason is because the 50% Qiviut Lace Yarn includes new expenses such as the cost of silk and the cost of blending the fibres before they are spun into yarn.
MUSKOX QIVIUT DK YARN
30/60/10 Qiviut/Superfine Merino/Silk DK Yarn – This DK or #4 qiviut yarn blend is made from 30% qiviut, 60% superfine merino and 10% silk. In 2020, based on customer requests, Nunavut Qiviut began experimenting with making a thicker qiviut yarn. It is made in a 2 ounce skein and is 150 yards per skein. This 30/60/10 qiviut blend maintains the feel and halo of qiviut and is an economic yarn on a per ounce basis compared to yarns with a higher composition of qiviut. The lower blend ratio of qiviut in the blend also allows for a lighter colour palette of dyeing opportunities. We chose pastel colours for the 10 available. Nunavut Qiviut DK qiviut yarn is suitable to a diversity of knit and crochet projects.
ARCTIC FOX QIVIUT LACE YARN
Nunavut Qiviut began experimenting with Arctic fox qiviut in yarns in 2016 and by 2018 released its first Arctic fox yarn. It is a 30% Arctic fox qiviut, 60% superfine merino, and 10% silk blend. This blend behaves as a superfine merino lace yarn. The colour of Arctic fox qiviut is a very light grey, and when blended with superfine merino and silk, the result is an almost pure white yarn with a light-grey tint. Nunavut Qiviut has experimented with dyeing this yarn, but the natural white colour has been very popular, so we have not made commercial quantities of dyed Arctic fox yarn yet. Some knitting customers have made beautiful patterns of hats with the Arctic fox (or Arctic hare) yarn on its own or as an accent colour with the muskox qiviut yarns as the base yarn. This is a very durable yarn that knits like superfine merino and because it has a white starting colour it accepts dyes well. It is perfect for home dyeing projects.
Muskox and Arctic Hare are harvested by Inuit for food. Wild Arctic Fox are humanely harvested by Inuit with quick kill traps and they are used for their fur, as has been done for centuries. Arctic Fox have the largest litter size of any canine in the world. Arctic Fox populations are highly variable; they explode at the peak of lemming cycles, and then they suffer mass starvations when food sources crash. Arctic Fox populations must be carefully monitored near towns because like other small southern predatory mammals like racoons, bats, and skunks, Arctic Fox can occasionally contract the rabies virus and can carry it into Arctic towns where dogs and people can be put at risk. Sustainable and humane Arctic Fox trapping practices help monitor and manage Arctic Fox populations near Arctic communities.
ARCTIC HARE QIVIUT LACE YARNS
Nunavut Qiviut began experimenting with Arctic hare qiviut yarns in 2017. It is debateable whether or not Arctic Hare have qiviut because they are not dual-coated; instead, the animal is covered with a uniformly alabaster white coat of ultra-soft fluffy fur. Nunavut Qiviut calls the fur Arctic Hare qiviut because the fibre is as fine and as soft as muskox and Arctic fox qiviut. Amazingly, Arctic Hare has no winter fat reserves and relies solely on fur for insulation. Traditional Inuit knowledge is that if one tries to live on Arctic Hare protein alone, starvation will follow due to a lack of fat. People with a diet of Arctic Hare must supplement the diet with fat or risk survival.
Arctic Hare Qiviut Yarn is 30% Arctic hare, 50% superfine merino, and 20% silk blend. This blend behaves like a superfine merino lace yarn. Arctic Hare qiviut is pure white, so it is an even whiter, brighter colour than the Arctic Fox yarn. It must be compared side by side to appreciate the whiteness of the Arctic Hare Yarn. Arctic Hare Qiviut Lace Yarn knits and dyes the same as Arctic Fox Qiviut Lace Yarn.
Nunavut Qiviut Dyes
Pure muskox qiviut dyes into deep jewel tones because it has a natural brown colour. Nunavut Qiviut does not bleach or de-pigment its valuable pure muskox qiviut to obtain brighter colours, because this can damage or weaken fibres. Blends with superfine merino and silk allow for lighter tones while maintaining the qiviut fibre quality. Nunavut Qiviut uses Greener Shades dyes which are metal-free and organically certified.
We have experimented with dying our Arctic Fox and Arctic Hare Qiviut Lace Yarn and both accept any colours very well. There is so much demand for the natural white colour that we do not produce dyed yarns except for custom orders. . ",False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False
canadianimmigrant,https://canadianimmigrant.ca/settlement/living-in-iqaluit-nunavut ,"The territorial capital, as well as the largest community of the Canadian territory of Nunavut, is Iqaluit. Located on the south coast of Baffin Island at the head of Frobisher Bay, in the Everett Mountains rising from Koojesse Inlet, this capital city has a mere 6,184 inhabitants, meaning it has the smallest population of any capital in Canada. The city’s inhabitants are known as Iqalummiut. Before 1987, this city was known as Frobisher Bay.
Predominantly inhabited by First Nations peoples, this capital city is not popular with newcomers, but don’t discount it if you have a taste for adventure and some of the most spectacular winter landscapes and wildlife you’ll ever see.

In all of Canada, the highest First Nations populations can be found in Nunavut. In fact, 86.2 per cent (2006 Census Report, Statistics Canada) are First Nations. Often living in small communities, the largest group is the Inuit, which means “the preeminent people” and are also commonly referred to as “Eskimos.” The Inuits make up 84.8 per cent of the First Nations population in the territory. You’ll also likely meet Métis and Dene peoples as well in Nunavut. As for non-First Nations ethnicities, 13.5 per cent is made up of Scots, Irish and French peoples, among others. .

canadashistory,https://www.canadashistory.ca/explore/politics-law/the-creation-of-nunavut ,"On April 1, 1999, the map of Canada was redrawn: the Northwest Territories divides into two territories to allow for the creation of Nunavut, a homeland for Canada’s Inuit. The creation of Nunavut is testament to the strength of Inuit political leaders and to the flexibility of Canadian political institutions.
Over the past six years, Inuit leaders have been busy preparing for this event. Everything from new symbols on flags and licence plates to new buildings to house a legislative assembly to new electoral districts and election of a new governing territorial assembly has been prepared in anticipation of this moment. And now, the real work begins.
The new territory of Nunavut is geographically large, with a unique variety of landscapes and ecosystems. The whole territory, from the glacial mountain fiords of the east coast of Baffin Island to the rolling rock hills of the west coast of Hudson Bay, is arctic terrain, which means that it is all to the north of the treeline.
What remains of the N.W.T. is frequently called the western Arctic but more appropriately should be called subarctic, since the vastest portion of that territory lies within the treeline. Nunavut can best be described with reference to the distinctive culture, history, and politics of the majority of its inhabitants, who are Inuit.
Inuit is an Inuktitut language word for people. Inuk for person. For much of recent history they were known as Eskimos, but obviously preferred the substitution of their own term for themselves. While the striking aspects of their material culture are well known — iglu (snowhouse) and kayak (small boat) perhaps better than ulu (woman’s knife) and umiak (large boat) — their intellectual culture and values have served Inuit as well in the modern world as their unique technology did in earlier ages.
For the most part, Inuit prize flexibility and ingenuity — a good idea is not something to hold back in the interest of maintaining the way things were always done. At the same time, elders and ancient traditions are highly respected. Balancing these two — an appreciation for newness and respect for the wisdom of the ages — will be one of the challenges of Nunavut.
Archaeologists maintain that modern Inuit, who certainly have a language and culture distinct from that of other indigenous Americans, are the descendants of Thule peoples who were late (and last) to cross the Bering Strait, coming as recently as a millennium ago. Inuit have a rich legacy of creation stories, some of which affirm their belief that they were placed in their homeland by their own creator.
Traditional Inuit culture remains strong in Arctic communities because Inuit continue to depend to a great extent on hunting to get enough food to survive (and food sharing remains a critical aspect of community economies).
Inuit visual arts have provided strong expressive mechanisms for the transmission of Inuit culture, and the Inuit language, Inuktitut, has remained resilient, due in part to a deliberate policy of Inuit leaders.
In the playgrounds of the many Arctic communities I have visited, the language of play has been Inuktitut — surely as good an indicator as any of a language’s vitality.
The history of the Arctic is rich and complex. Though most historians have focused attention on explorers and expeditions, cultural contact in the Arctic and Inuit responses to colonialism are compelling themes that will continue to gain increasing scholarly and public attention. Although nineteenth-century whaling had some local impact, for the most part Inuit economic life remained in its indigenous pattern until the fox and seal fur trades of our own century.
Hence there were Inuit Canadians who as late as the 1950s had little or no exposure to outsiders. Permanent settlement into communities was for many Inuit a phenomenon of the fifties and sixties. One of the biggest challenges facing the leaders of Nunavut will be to find a way out of the economic dependence that has become the most debilitating legacy of colonial relations. Many of those leaders were born “on the land” in what amounts to another world.
Politically the Arctic islands became part of Canada in 1880, though virtually nothing was done about them until 1897 when William Wakeham, co-chairman of an international boundary commission, ceremonially hoisted a flag at Kekerten Island in Cumberland Sound, now a historic Territorial park.
It was not until 1921 that an appointed council composed of Ottawa-based civil-servants, began to actively govern the Arctic and instituted the series of annual eastern Arctic ship patrols that brought supplies and services to coastal communities.
The status of Inuit, legally uncertain, was settled in 1939 in the Supreme Court of Canada decision Re: Eskimos, which determined Inuit were a federal responsibility and in effect, aboriginal citizens; however, Inuit were not directly consulted about the governance of their lands and communities until the late fifties. In 1965 Abraham Okpik became the first Inuk appointed to the territorial council. In 1966 the council expanded to include seven elected members, with Simonie Michael the first Inuk elected.
Slowly the territorial council evolved into an elected, representative body, with Inuit actively involved in its workings. By the early seventies, Inuit in N.W.T. also organized themselves into the Inuit Tapirisat of Canada, an association with a broad mandate to preserve Inuit culture and promote Inuit interests. By the eighties, the ITC represented Inuit across the nation.
Nunavut was a long-standing goal from the ITC, which presented the notion formally as early as its first land claim in 1976. A lengthy treatise would be needed to detail the twists and turns around the question of division that occupied Inuit politicians in the late seventies through the eighties. Suffice to say, however, that a generation of astute political leaders emerged among Inuit, many of them women, who with patience, determination, creativity, and will achieved a vision: Nunavut.
Nunavut is an Inuktitut word for “our land.” Unlike other First Nations in Canada, Inuit have not been interested in separate governing institutions. Rather, their particular situation as majority occupants of the Arctic has led them to promote the notion of increased power for their public governments (as opposed to aboriginal governments) as a vehicle for their political aspirations. They will be able to use their substantial majority to elect enough Inuit politicians that the government of Nunavut will be theirs. At least, they are able to do so for the foreseeable future.
Nunavut is in part the creation of a land claim, the 1993 Nunavut Land Settlement Agreement, which stipulated in one section the division of the N.W.T. The land claim is now administered by a body called the Nunavut Tungavik Incorporated, which, as a large capital and landholder, will be a major player representing the Inuit interests in Nunavut.
Recommendations setting up the Nunavut government were made by a body called the Nunavut Implementation Commission. It was chaired by John Amagoalik, widely acknowledged as a founder of the territory. Its work ended in 1997 when an interim commissioner, former member of parliament Jack Anawak, was appointed to carry out its recommendations.
Over the past six years, the Inuit community has been engaged in frenetic activity to have in place by the April 1, 1999, deadline, the human and material infrastructure demanded by the new government. Over the next eight years increased responsibilities will be devolved to the Government of Nunavut. By the end of that time it will be a province-like jurisdiction as the N.W.T. is today. Inuktitut is an official language in the new territory.
The capital of Nunavut is Iqaluit (formerly Frobisher Bay), but every attempt has been made to decentralize and develop regional centres. There are three main regions in Nunavut: the communities on and near Baffin Island, the Kitikmeot communities on the coast and islands of the central Arctic, and the Kivilik communities in the region of the northwest coast of Hudson Bay.
Every one of the twenty-six Nunavut communities (the total population amounts to a mere seventeen thousand) is its own unique microcosm, and each has developed its own strategy for dealing with the traumas of the past and the challenges of the future. The difference, for example, between Rankin Inlet, which on the surface has the rough-and-ready feel of a northern resource town, and nearby Whale Cove, where an older rhythm of life still prevails, is striking.
While many would assess Nunavut’s ultimate chances based on its oil, gas, and mineral resource base, it should be noted that there is another resource with which Nunavut remains strikingly endowed — the continued presence of elders who hold a treasure-trove of invaluable knowledge, stories, skills, and values. Culture itself is one of the truly great assets of Inuit.
For better or worse, so-called “authentic” aboriginal culture — and the commodities it can produce — will only increase in value over the next century. The degree that Nunavut, in its very forms of operation and decision making, reflects, embodies, and conveys the Inuit culture from which it has emerged, may ultimately determine its chances of success.

The Nunavut Land Claims, which was settled in 1993, included a commitment for the establishment of a separate territory. Subsequently federal legislation was passed in the form of the Nunavut Act, which constitutionally allowed for the new territory and the new Government of Nunavut to be implemented commencing April1, 1999.
The new Nunavut Territorial Government would require an infrastructure of office buildings, legislative facilities and staff housing. The decentralized model of the government magnified these requirements
Inuit leadership through NTI recognized that these infrastructure needs contained the elements of a significant investment opportunity for the Inuit beneficiary corporations along with substantial business opportunities that would provide a great boost to Nunavut economic development.
After the “partnering arrangement” was negotiated, with agreement reached by all parties NCC was established as an “arms length” private corporate vehicle by which the Inuit could pursue these economic opportunities. The four beneficiary corporations became the owners of NCC, taking equal shares of 25% each.

Nunavut’s Territorial Parks and Special Places are places that express and represent the environmental, cultural, social, and economic values that define the spirit of Nunavut. These values shape the way we respond to the land. The Nunavut Parks & Special Places division’s role is to protect important places that reflect these values for generations to come. We do not ‘own’ the land; we are simply stewards of those places for Nunavummiut.
Our principles describe how the program will be delivered in order to fulfill the program’s mandate for ours and future generations.
Joint Planning and Management
Nunavut’s Territorial Parks and Special Places are planned and managed jointly with full support of residents and communities. We recognize Inuit rights, as well as landscape and resource values in keeping with the NLCA and IIBA.
Involvement
To continue to meet the needs of Nunavummiut and visitors, and recognizing ecological, social, cultural and economic factors must be considered; we will ensure and encourage meaningful and continuing involvement in all aspects of parks.

Nunavut Parks & Special Places is the lead Territorial agency responsible for the protection and promotion of natural and cultural heritage landscapes and recreation opportunities in Nunavut. Its legislative mandate is the Territorial Parks Act and it participates in other key statutes such as the Nunavut Wildlife Act, and the Travel and Tourism Act. The Division is also obligated under the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement (primarily Article 8 and Article 9) and the Umbrella Inuit Impact and Benefits Agreement for Territorial Parks; and is directed by GN policies such as Iqqanijaqatigiit and Pinasuaqtavut.
Currently, the division is headquartered in Iqaluit with staff in each of the three regions (Baffin – Iqaluit, Kivalliq – Rankin Inlet, and Kitikmeot – Kugluktuk) and Kimmirut. The Division is overseen by the Director, Parks and Special Places who, as Superintendent of Nunavut Parks, is responsible for overall establishment, planning and management of Parks and Special Places, operations and promotion of Park and related Visitor Services Facilities, and the Division’s Land Claim responsibilities.
Though overlaps and interactions exist, there are currently three main program areas in the Parks and Special Places division: program development; park operations and planning; and land claims and geospatial information. The Department has also supported Parks and Special Places having a greater, future, role in a fourth program area: coordinating conservation initiatives. This will become more important as Nunavut gets increasingly involved in meeting its national and international commitments related to the development of conservation areas strategies, marine protected areas, and biodiversity.

Traveling to Nunavut
Nunavut is a very accessible destination for your vacation plans – only 3 hours away from a major city airport. For visitors wishing to travel to the western Kitikmeot region, your southern ‘gateway’ cities include Calgary and Edmonton (Alberta) flying through Yellowknife. Paddlers, fishers, and others en route to the central Kivalliq region would fly from Winnipeg (Manitoba) direct to Rankin Inlet, and for Baffin Island destinations, travellers board in either Ottawa (Ontario) or Montreal (Quebec) for direct service to Nunavut’s capital city of Iqaluit. There is also east-west routing that links Yellowknife – Rankin Inlet – Iqaluit – and Ottawa.
There are no roads leading to Nunavut from other parts of Canada, nor between communities within the region. For general travel, all communities are fly-in only. Cambridge Bay, Rankin Inlet, and Iqaluit are the transportation hubs for their respective regions. Most communities are serviced daily by one or more regional airlines, however smaller communities may be less frequent. Charters are also available. Some northern airlines also fly routes between the regions providing extra flexibility in scheduling your itinerary.

Traveling in Nunavut
With few roads and many of its communities scattered over islands and archipelagos, Nunavut benefits from regularly scheduled air service that links most of its communities. Flights to the smaller communities operate two or three times a week, while some of the larger communities have daily service.
If you can’t find a scheduled flight to your destination, a charter service can probably get you there. Charter aircraft – including helicopters – are often the only way to reach many fishing camps and parks. If you’re taking a package tour, the charter cost will probably be included, but check to be sure.
It is important to note that flights within Nunavut are frequently delayed by bad weather, particularly in the small communities where air operations run under visual flight rules. And don’t be surprised when an aircraft is taken off scheduled service to fly as an air ambulance.

Taxi Service
In most communities, local taxis meet every commercial flight that comes in. There are also usually dedicated phones at airports and in some of the hotels. Taxis usually charge a flat rate per person, and typically more than one group uses the cab at the same time, so don’t be surprised if the driver pulls up at other destinations to pick up or drop off passengers before getting to your stop, and don’t pass up a taxi just because you see a passenger inside. There may be only one or two taxis in town, so hop in, if there’s room.
Vehicle Rentals
Although most Nunavut communities are small enough to explore on foot, many them still offer rental vehicles in addition to taxi service. In areas of the Kitikmeot, around communities such as Cambridge Bay, there are networks of roadways or trails that people use to drive to cottages and camps in outlying areas. As well, in towns like Iqaluit and Rankin Inlet there are a few stretches of pavement, although, most community roads are gravel only. Despite the limited number of roads, it is possible to rent ATVs, snow machines, and in a few places, cars or vans. To rent a vehicle in Nunavut, you require a Canadian provincial, territorial, or international driver’s license. Travellers considering rentals should also keep in mind that most tour operators and accommodation suppliers usually provide transport for their guests.
Arranging a Tour
For adventure-seeking visitors to Nunavut, tour operators and outfitters offer a wide range of excursions that include various levels of services. Outfitters usually operate between March and September, which is Nunavut’s peak travel season. They can still be contacted in the off-season months to facilitate planning, however due to cold temperatures and reduced daylight, few travellers visit during this time of year.
If you’re already visiting a northern community and feel like taking a tour on the tundra or going on a fishing trip, check in with the Visitor Centre, hamlet office or with Hunters and Trappers Organization (HTO) – who can refer you to a local licensed guide or outfitter.
Check with Nunavut Tourism for more information on outfitters, guides, and arranging package tours.
Accommodations
You have a number of different options for accommodations during your visit to Nunavut, from the modern hotel with conference facilities to the cozy comfort of B&Bs and tourist homes, as well as the warm hospitality of a homestay experience with an Inuit family. A list of accommodations in each community servicing a park is located in their profiles.
In Nunavut, lodgings can range from very comfortable full-service hotels comparable to many southern facilities to interesting small hotels, home stays, bed and breakfast facilities or even a night in an igloo. As with most Nunavut experiences, a hotel stay in any or our small Arctic communities can be part of a very unique and rewarding cultural encounter.
There are a few hotels and lodges in Nunavut of exceptional quality and service – similar or exceeding the standards found in hotels across Canada. However, many community hotels are not luxurious, although most are clean and functional. Space is limited in the smaller communities, and it is fairly common to share a room with others. Initially this may not seem an attractive option to the solo traveller, however you are guaranteed to meet fascinating people from all over the world, engaged in all kinds of interesting adventures and activities. Similar to other northern experiences, hotels are expensive – you can expect to pay $140-$180 per night, not including meals. Meals will run on average an extra $60-$90 per day if you eat in the hotel – which is often the only place in town to get a meal. Also be aware that rates are usually quoted per person or per bed, as opposed to per room.
A number of communities have a bed & breakfast as an alternative to the hotel. They are usually a little less expensive, and as their name suggests the cost includes breakfast. You will have to make arrangements with your host or the local hotel for your other meals. Tourist homes are similar, although you usually have access to a kitchen and you are responsible for cooking all your own meals.
Some travellers wish to immerse themselves into the culture and billet with a local Inuit family. This is possible, however, unlike other accommodations, homestays are not regulated by any standards for quality or safety and they are not licensed by the Government of Nunavut. It is your sole responsibility to investigate what services will be provided. A few good questions to start with include, “Have you done this before?”, “Are meals included?”, and “Do I get my own room, or just a bed?” The Inuit are incredibly hospitable and a homestay is a unique opportunity for an authentic travelling experience, however be aware that northern living conditions are very different and full of surprises even for the experienced traveller. To arrange a homestay, begin by calling the hamlet office or visitor centre in the community you wish to visit for a list of families offering this service.
You’ll also find lodges and outpost camps in many areas of Nunavut. They are usually not located in a community and are most often operating seasonally. Many such facilities cater to or specialize in specific Arctic activities and expeditions such as sport fishing and wildlife tours. While quite comfortable, you are most likely to have to share accommodations in an outpost camp and may have to bring your own sleeping bag.
Safe Travel
Supplies and Information
Welcome to Nunavut Parks! Our parks will offer you spectacular scenery, unique wildlife, and opportunities to experience Inuit culture and learn about northern places few people go. But, there are a host of associated dangers with travel in this northern wilderness. The remoteness of the area, and limited rescue capabilities increase the risk of the challenging natural hazards. All visitors must be prepared to deal with extreme and rapidly changing weather, unpredictable river crossings, high winds, and wildlife – including polar bears – which you may not be familiar with.
Remember, you must be self-reliant and responsible for your own safety!

Planning Your Trip
Please read the following information from beginning to end. It will help you know more about what to expect in Nunavut Parks. This information is not definitive and cannot replace your own planning. You should also look at other sources of information about Arctic travel and wildlife.
When traveling in remote wilderness, there is always some risk. You must be self-reliant and responsible for your own safety. All costs of a search and rescue are the responsibility of the visitor. Search and rescue may be difficult or impossible under certain conditions. Survival in an emergency will depend on how well prepared you are to deal with the extremes of changeable weather, river crossings and wildlife, including polar bears.
When you arrive in Nunavut, the mandatory parks registration and orientation system will allow you to find out about the area you will be visiting. Ask park staff for specific information regarding your trip plans and be flexible in case you receive information that will cause you to alter your plans.
If you have any doubts about your skill level and experience, consider hiring a local guide or outfitter.
Ask yourself the following questions:
- Do you have experience in Arctic wilderness travel?
- Are you prepared to travel in polar bear country and willing to accept the risk?
- Do you have first aid and wilderness survival skills required for self-reliance?
- Will you be traveling with others who have experience and training?
- Do you have the necessary camping gear, maps, safety equipment, first aid and repair kits?
- Are you willing to reassess and possibly change your trip plans if necessary?
- Do you have judgment, patience and respect for changing conditions?
- Do you have time and provisions for unexpected delays such as waiting out bad weather, high water levels, boat shuttles held up by rough water or tides, and delays in flight schedules?
- Do you have alternate plans with things to do in communities if you are unable to make your destination?
Self-planned canoe and kayak trips are popular with northern visitors. You will need specialized gear, knowledge and preparation.
Before embarking on a canoe or kayak trip in Nunavut consider the following:
- Are you comfortable with bracing, maneuvering, surf landing, surf launching and self-rescue techniques?
- Can you interpret marine charts and tide tables and use them to identify marine hazards?
- Can you travel on a bearing and use triangulation to establish your position?
- Can you navigate in fog?
- Are you able to estimate the speed of currents and estimate ferry angles under varying conditions?
- Do you have white water experience, canoe spray decks and wetsuits?
- Do you have the necessary maps and river reports?
- Have you considered ice conditions, tides and water levels that may delay your trip?
- Have you considered the safest size of group in case one of your boats is damaged?
In An Emergency
You must carry appropriate gear and take every precaution to keep yourself, and those who may be called upon to rescue you, out of danger.
Consider the following:
- Order necessary maps well in advance of your trip. Don’t rely on obtaining them when you arrive in the north. Check with the Natural Resources Canada Centre for Topographic Information for a list of map dealers
- Carry and know how to use emergency communication devices such as satellite phones. Some satellite phones may be available for rent in Nunavut but you are advised to rent one at home to bring on your trip. Be aware that local topography and weather conditions can limit reception. Carry a Global Positioning System (GPS) unit for navigation as well as for relaying accurate location coordinates in case of emergency.
- Know how to use your equipment before your leave on your trip. Batteries don’t last as long in cold weather so keep equipment warm and use them only when necessary.
- There are limited aircraft throughout Nunavut. Planes and helicopters are rarely stationed in smaller communities. Air access can be delayed, sometimes for many days, due to poor visibility, weather conditions, or high winds. Aircraft can only land if the terrain is safe.
Weather
The Arctic experiences long, cold winters and short, cool summers. Although summer brings long hours of daylight throughout Nunavut, there are areas where the sun never rises during winter. Because of greatly reduced hours of daylight and extreme cold, it is very uncommon for visitors to travel in winter in most of Nunavut. Only people with specialized skills and equipment should attempt winter travel.
Winds of 15 to 20 kilometers per hour are common year round throughout Nunavut. Winds are stronger from late summer to early winter and can reach extremes of over 100 kilometers per hour very quickly. Beware of blowing sand in summer and white out conditions when there is snow.
Know the signs and symptoms of hypothermia and how to treat it. Know how to prevent hypothermia by staying warm, dry, well fed and hydrated. Carry plenty of water with you year round to avoid dehydration. Freezing temperatures and snow are possible at any time of year.
Think carefully about the clothing that you will bring.
- Windproof gloves, over-mitts, a warm hat, scarf, balaclava or neck gaiter and wool socks are standard gear year round.
- Varying temperatures and vigorous outdoor activity require layered clothing. Start with long underwear bottoms and tops followed by additional upper and lower layers.
- Depending on the weather, cover up with either windproof or breathable waterproof jackets and pants.
- Do not wear cotton. When cotton gets wet from rain, snow or perspiration it cools your body temperature, potentially leading to hypothermia.
- Bring a warm parka with a hood.
- Bring sturdy hiking boots, running shoes for around your camp, and neoprene booties with water sandals if you plan to travel on water, as well as for creek and river crossings.
- Traveling by boat, your feet will be in contact with the hull of the boat where the temperature is usually close to freezing. Bring insulated rubber boots or oversized regular rubber boots with layers of wool or pile socks inside.
- Wear a hat as well as sunscreen with high sun protection factor.
- Protect your eyes with high ultraviolet filter sunglasses.
River Crossings
Stream and river depths can change over the course of a day and from one day to the next. This creates a challenge to assess safe crossings. Rivers in Nunavut are also very cold and must be treated with additional caution when crossing.
Consider the following:
- Cross major rivers and streams early in the day, especially those that are glacier fed. Water levels tend to be lowest early in the morning when the sun is weakest.
- Rainfall can dramatically increase river and stream flow. Changes in water levels and flow rate may be immediate, or delayed by several hours.
- If in doubt about your ability to cross a stream or river, wait until the water level is lower. It may be necessary to wait for a few hours or days until flow diminishes.
- The dynamic nature of rivers and streams means that safe crossing places change. You will have to assess each crossing for yourself, looking up and down stream for the safest place.
- River or stream sections on flat ground with several branches tend to be shallower than single, main channels.
- Undo waist and chest straps when crossing so that your pack can be removed quickly if necessary.
- Cross as a group, linking arms to support one another. Move diagonally across the current, with the strongest member upstream.
- Use a ski pole or hiking stick to test water depth and to help with balance while crossing.
- Neoprene booties with water sandals will protect your feet from cold water, tumbling rocks as well as keep your boots and socks dry.
Wildlife Safety
As a rule, keep your distance and avoid contact with all wildlife. It is illegal to touch, feed or entice wildlife in Nunavut. Contact the Government of Nunavut, Department of Environment Wildlife Division for information about fishing and hunting in Nunavut.
Grizzly bears are found on mainland Nunavut from the east coast of Hudson Bay across the barrens. You should take the same safety precautions in these parts of Nunavut as you would in any bear country. For general grizzly bear safety information contact the Government of Northwest Territories Resources, Wildlife and Economic Development Department. For Nunavut Parks specific grizzly bear information contact the Nunavut Department of Environment, Parks and Conservation Areas or Wildlife Division.
Muskoxen, particularly if they are lone bulls, have been known to charge and gore people when threatened. Walruses and whales can be aggressive and can easily capsize a boat. Rabies is present throughout Nunavut, especially in foxes but also in wolves. Birds and wildlife will scavenge food, garbage and caches that are not secure.
Arctic Insects
In Nunavut, as in many parts of Canada’s North, biting insects can be annoying during the summer. Although the problem varies from one area to another, it is best to come prepared.
Here are a few tips on how to ward off insects:
- When bugs are bad, head for open areas and high ridges where wind will blow them away.
- Wear light colours. Insects are not as attracted to these as they are to dark clothing.
- Bring long sleeved shirts, long pants, a bug hat or jacket and bug repellent.
- If you are allergic to bees, bring appropriate medication with you. There are very few pharmacies in Nunavut especially in smaller communities.
- Check that the netting and door zippers on your tent are in good shape. Bring a tent repair kit with netting patches for repairs.
Minimum Impact Travel
Plants and animals in the Arctic are very vulnerable to human disturbance because of the harsh climate and short growing season. Ensure that your impact on the land is minimized.
Practice the following:
- Respect wildlife and wildlife habitat. Do not approach wildlife for any reason, including photographs. Avoid nesting, calving, and denning areas. Many Arctic birds are ground nesters, so watch for bird nests and chicks.
- Leave rocks, plants and other natural objects, such as skulls and antlers, as you find them. Not only does collecting spoil the experience for others but you may be breaking laws.
- Do not build cairns, markers, or leave messages in the dirt. These can be potentially misleading and dangerous for other visitors. Do not disturb or destroy any cairns that you do find, as some are of great historical significance.
- Do not camp on, or remove any rocks from any features that look like archaeological sites. Archaeological sites are important cultural resources that tell us about life in Nunavut over thousands of years.
- Travel and camp on durable surfaces where your signs will be minimal, especially for base camps or if you are traveling in a group.
- Wear soft shoes around your camp. This is not only a great relief after a day spent in heavy hiking boots but also minimizes impact around your campsite.
- Avoid camping near sensitive vegetated areas. Do not dig trenches around tents or build rock windbreaks. If you do use rocks to secure your tent, return them to their original location before you leave.
- Use a camp stove to cook. Vegetation should not be used for fires. Stove fuel must be bought locally due to dangerous goods transport laws.
- Come well supplied with food, particularly specialized products like dried or dehydrated food. Bring food in plastic bags instead of cans, bottles or foil. Carefully measure your meals to minimize leftovers that may attract wildlife. Avoid foods with strong odours.
- Pack out all of your garbage including food scraps and packaging. Do not burn packaging as lingering food odours may become attractants to bears. Pick up any spilled food from your cooking and eating areas. Pick up litter left by others and report any large accumulations to parks staff.
- Avoid using soap. If you must use soap, use biodegradable soap. Waste water should be deposited at least 100 meters away from campsites and water bodies.
- Feces should be packed out or buried under rocks away from trails, at least 100 meters from your camp and from all water sources. If you are traveling in a large group or using a base camp, dig a shallow ‘cat hole’ approximately 15 centimeters deep and at least 100 meters away from traffic routes, campsites, and bodies of water. Make sure that the hole is covered over after use to hide its presence and to discourage animals from digging it up. If traveling in coastal areas along a body of salt water, it is acceptable to bury your feces in a shallow pit below the high water mark. Put all used toilet paper and feminine hygiene products in a sealed bag with your garbage.

Registration, Permits and Rentals
Territorial Parks have been established to help park visitors have a safe and enjoyable experience. Through pre-trip information visitors find out about potential hazards as well as safe and low impact travel practices required in Arctic environments.
Visitors must inform themselves, plan and organize logistics, equipment and supplies as much as possible at home while still in the trip planning process. Visitors are asked to read “Polar Bear Safety in Nunavut Territorial Parks” as well as “Safe and Sustainable Travel in Nunavut Territorial Parks” mandatory pre-trip information. Pre-trip information is available at www.nunavutparks.com or in print format by request.
Visitors should determine their choices regarding bear deterrents, emergency communications devices, firearms and other specialized equipment before leaving home. Visitors should also inform themselves about access to Inuit Owned Lands as well as hunting and fishing regulations if applicable to their trip.
Registration
As the last point of contact for up-to-date trip information before visitors embark into a Nunavut park, the registration and orientation process is a chance for visitors to finalize their level of preparation and equipment for their trip, as well as to ask park staff any remaining questions.
Currently, registration/de-registration is mandatory for all visitors planning trips into Katannilik Territorial Park. If you are planning a wilderness trip to one of Nunavut’s other parks, register your plans with the RCMP at the detachment closest to your departure point (and very importantly DO NOT forget to check in when you return!) It’s a good idea to leave your plans with someone you trust as well.
For Katannilik, registration and de-registration is available at the Unikkaarvik Visitor Centre in Iqaluit and the Katannilik Territorial Park Visitor Centre in Kimmirut. Guided visitors must be registered through their guide / outfitter company. Guide / Outfitting companies must contact Nunavut Territorial Parks Headquarters in Iqaluit for details of the Guides and Outfitters Registration / Deregistration and Orientation process.
A Nunavut Parks Registration Form must be completed and signed jointly by group leaders and registration staff during the registration and orientation process. The Registration Form is a record of expected trip plans, equipment and supplies.
Through the registration process visitors can obtain additional, known, up-to-date information including safety notices, land and water conditions, as well as wildlife sighting reports and emergency shelters / group shelter use levels. Registration allows parks staff to know intended travel routes and expected dates of return. Group leaders must acknowledge that all group members have read and understood the Safe and Sustainable Travel / Polar Bear Safety in Nunavut Territorial Parks mandatory pre-trip information.
To be most beneficial, this information must be read at home while visitors are still in the trip planning process.
As part of the mandatory registration process all park visitors watch the Safe and Sustainable Travel / Polar Bear Safety in Nunavut Territorial Parks Orientation Slideshow. This audio-visual presentation is an opportunity to see images and hear key messages reinforcing considerations that visitors should make before embarking on their Nunavut Territorial Parks experience.
Group leaders must also de-register at the end of their trip. De-registration allows park staff to know that registered groups have returned. De-registration is an opportunity for visitors to convey information back to park staff including park conditions, wildlife sightings and level of satisfaction with park facilities and information. If a group does not return by the date agreed upon on the registration form, a search and rescue effort will be initiated.
All search and rescue costs are the responsibility of the visitor.
Visitors should be aware that search and rescue efforts can be delayed, sometimes for many days, due to poor visibility, weather conditions or high winds. Aircraft can only land if terrain is safe.

Inuit Owned Lands
With the May 25, 1993 signing of the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement (NLCA), Inuit of the central and eastern arctic were given a new territory: Nunavut. The agreement provides Inuit of Nunavut with benefits such as equal representation with government, wildlife harvesting rights, and the title to approximately 350,000 km2 of land – these lands are known as Inuit Owned Lands.
There were four primary considerations for the selection of Inuit Owned Lands within the NLCA. They include:
- Areas of value principally for renewable resource reasons
- Areas of value principally for reasons related to the development of non-renewable resources
- Areas of commercial value; and
- Areas of archaeological, historical or cultural importance.
Access to Inuit Owned Lands
Some of Nunavut’s territorial parks are adjacent to Inuit Owned Lands. In some cases, Inuit Owned Lands may fall within the boundary of the territorial parks. Nunavut Parks makes every effort to provide mapping and signage indicating where these lands exist.
Visitors who want access to Inuit Owned Lands are required to get authorization from the appropriate Regional Inuit Association. For further information and to apply for such authorization, see the following:

The Izok Corridor Project includes the Izok and High Lake deposits located in Nunavut in the Canadian arctic within a geological formation known as the Slave Geological Province. Izok is a zinc/copper deposit with a Mineral Resource of 15 million tonnes at 13% zinc and 2.3% copper. The High Lake deposit, located north of Izok, has a Mineral Resource of 14 million tonnes at 3.8% zinc and 2.5% copper.
The Izok Corridor Project offers the potential for significant socio-economic contributions to the Nunavut, Northwest Territories and Canadian economies.
Project development requires construction of a 325-kilometre all-weather road, as well as a deep-water port on the Arctic Ocean to facilitate transportation of metal concentrates to overseas markets. MMG also holds several other base metal deposits and exploration tenements in this highly prospective region.
In August 2019, MMG welcomed the commitment from the Canadian National Trade Corridors Fund to commit CAD $21.5 million to the design, permitting and development of the Grays Bay Road and Port (GBRP) Project.
The funding from the Canadian Government’s National Trade Corridors Fund will be used to advance the design, permitting and feasibility of the project to ‘shovel-ready’ stage. The road and port represent critical infrastructure to open up access to the Greenstone belts of the Slave Geological Province, which host MMG’s Izok and High Lake deposits.

wikivoyage,https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Nunavut ,"Nunavut is a territory in northern Canada which contains Canada's northernmost lands. With only 37,000 inhabitants, Nunavut covers a land area larger than Mexico, divided between mainland North America and an archipelago in the Arctic Ocean.
As of 2016, almost 85% of the people are part of an Indigenous group called the Inuit. They used to be called Eskimos, but this word is no longer used in Canada, and may be considered offensive by some. The singular form of ""Inuit"" is ""Inuk"" (""he is Inuk"" vs ""they are Inuit"").
Communities[edit]
Nunavut doesn't have ""cities"" in the sense that southerners would recognize, just small towns.
The Inuktitut name is in italics.
- 1 Iqaluit — capital and largest settlement of Nunavut
- 2 Pangnirtung (Pangniqtuuq) — gateway to the Auyuittuq National Park
- 3 Resolute (Qausuittuq) — on Cornwallis Island, close to where Sir John Franklin's lost expedition spent their first winter
- 4 Igloolik — the home-base of the only Inuit circus, Artcirq
- 5 Rankin Inlet (Kangiqliniq) — an air transport hub, and gateway to Iqalugaarjuup Nunanga Territorial Park
- 6 Gjoa Haven (Uqsuqtuuq) — Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen, intent on traversing the Northwest Passage, anchored the Gjoa here for nearly two years. Today, more than 1000 Netsilik Inuit call it home.
- 7 Cambridge Bay - nowadays, it's the largest stop for passenger and research vessels traversing the Arctic Ocean's Northwest Passage.
Other destinations[edit]
- 1 Alert — the world's northernmost settlement
- 1 Auyuittuq National Park — its name means ""the land that never melts"", and it includes many terrains of the Arctic wilderness, such as fjords, glaciers, and ice fields
- 2 Baffin Island (Qikiqtaaluk) — Canada's largest island, in the eastern portion of the territory of Nunavut
- 3 Ellesmere Island (Inuit: Umingmak Nuna, ""land of muskoxen"") —
- 4 Ellef Ringnes Island — the land nearest the geomagnetic north pole, which used to pass through the island
- 5 Devon Island (Inuit: Tatlurutit) — the world's largest deserted island... with a cemetery, the northernmost in the world
- 2 Qausuittuq National Park — covers 2/3 of Bathurst Island, and protects an important Peary caribou habitat
- 3 Quttinirpaaq National Park — protecting a huge area of polar desert on Ellesmere Island, accessible by charter tours, the launching point for trekking to the North Pole
- 4 Sirmilik National Park — the ""place of glaciers"" consists of three parcels on Baffin Island
- 5 Ukkusiksalik National Park — a park with more than 400 documented archaeological sites, near Repulse Bay on the mainland of Nunavut
- 6 Four Corners (Canada) — the remote meeting point of the borders of Nunavut, the Northwest Territories, Manitoba and Saskatchewan
Understand[edit]
Nunavut means our land in Inuktitut, the language of the Inuit. The official languages are English, French, Inuktitut, and Innuinaqtun.
It is one of the most sparsely populated regions of the world. The immense territory includes most of Canada's Arctic Islands, from Baffin Island in the territory's southeast, where the capital Iqaluit is located, to Ellesmere Island a few hundred kilometres from the North Pole. The territory also includes all of the islands in Hudson Bay.
History[edit]
The region which is now mainland Nunavut was first populated approximately 4500 years ago by the Pre-Dorset, a diverse Paleo-Eskimo culture that migrated eastward from the Bering Strait region. The Pre-Dorset culture was succeeded by the Dorset culture about 2800 years ago. The Dorset culture has been assumed to have developed from the Pre-Dorset, however the relationship between the two remains unclear.
Helluland, a location Norse explorers describe visiting in the Sagas of Icelanders, has been connected to Nunavut's Baffin Island.
The Thule people, ancestors of the modern Inuit, began migrating into the Northwest Territories and Nunavut from Alaska in the 11th century. By 1300, the geographic extent of Thule settlement included most of modern Nunavut. The migration of the Thule people coincides with the decline of the Dorset, who died out between 800 and 1500.
The written historical accounts of the area begin in 1576, with an account by English explorer Martin Frobisher. While leading an expedition to find the Northwest Passage, Frobisher thought he had discovered gold ore around the body of water now known as Frobisher Bay on the coast of Baffin Island. The ore turned out to be worthless, but Frobisher made the first recorded European contact with the Inuit.
Until the end of World War II, when the Canadian government began to realize its strategic importance, the Canadian far north was seen as a barren and desolate place, inhabited by Indigenous peoples and containing vast mineral resources that had (and have) yet to be exploited.
Cornwallis and Ellesmere Islands featured in the history of the Cold War in the 1950s. Concerned about the area's strategic geopolitical position, the federal government relocated Inuit from Nunavik (northern Quebec) to Resolute and Grise Fiord. In the unfamiliar and hostile conditions, they faced starvation, but were forced to stay.
Discussions on dividing the Northwest Territories along ethnic lines began in the 1950s, in order to give the Inuit people a degree of self-government. In 1982, after much debate and argument, it was decided to divide the Northwest Territories into two parts, one called Nunavut and the other retaining the name ""Northwest Territories"". On April 1, 1999, Nunavut came into existence.
Climate[edit]
Nunavut experiences a polar climate in most regions, owing to its high latitude and lower continental summertime influence than areas to the west. In more southerly continental areas very cold subarctic climates can be found, due to July being slightly milder than the required 10 °C (50 °F).
Talk[edit]
Around 65% of people living in Nunavut speak Inuktitut as a first language, and the language is co-official with English and French in the territory. Inuktitut is the traditional language spoken by the Inuit people, and is closely related to Greenlandic. It is a somewhat hard language to learn for the English speaker, and most English speaking people won’t even be able to read it because it is written in its own unique script. Though most Inuit probably speak English, it would be a good idea to learn a few key phrases or bring an Inuktitut phrase book along. Learning the script in any case is relatively easy to do. French may also be useful, though not necessary. In the more remote places, Inuktitut may be necessary. Public signage is generally bilingual in Inuktitut and English.
Get in[edit]
Access is only by air: there is no road or rail from the south. Every settlement has at least a landing strip.
Iqaluit Airport hosts scheduled passenger services from Ottawa, Montreal, Rankin Inlet, and smaller communities throughout eastern Nunavut. Flights from Yellowknife and Winnipeg go through Rankin Inlet.
Exploring Nunavut by cruise ship is a popular, but expensive option. Adventure Canada, Quark Expeditions, and EYOS Expeditions do cruises to the territory.
Get around[edit]
In the smaller communities (less than 3,000), ATVs and trucks are used during the short summer (when there is no snow).
In the winter, snowmobiles are the main way of getting around. Dog sleds are also used but owning and maintaining a dog team can be a very costly endeavour. Getting to and from the different communities can only be done by air; there are no roads linking the different population centres in the territory.
See[edit]
The capital, Iqaluit, has a few buildings of interest: the territorial legislature, a museum, and an igloo-shaped Anglican Church.
The Aurora Borealis can be easily seen from October to March in the centre of the community, but by taking a walk out of the town, they can be more spectacular. Inuit people have many legends about the auroras, which can be heard by talking to people in Rankin.
The midnight sun adds a magical element to travel in the Arctic. Winter is the time of darkness,but in summer, daylight lasts almost 24 hours in the more northerly communities.
In Gjoa Haven, you can explore sights associated with the Sir John Franklin's 1845 lost expedition and Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen. 100 km east of Resolute, you can visit Beechey Island, the Franklin expedition's first wintering location.
Artcirq is an Inuit circus performance collective based in Igloolik. It blends techniques of modern circus arts such as acrobatics, juggling, and clowning with traditional Inuit cultural practices including Inuit traditional games, throat singing, and drum dancing to create meaningful and original work through performing arts, music, and video.
Do[edit]
Guided excursions around the island and Arctic expeditions further afield organized by outfitters (there are several in Iqaluit) are the principal way of seeing Nunavut's truly great outdoors. Summer activities include trekking, and boat and fishing tours in Frobisher Bay. In the winter months, dog-sledding journeys are an excellent way to get out and explore the landscape.
Marine wildlife watching is particularly good in Resolute Bay: pods of beluga and narwhal can be seen from the beach as they head to their summer feeding grounds.
A walk five minutes outside a community like Rankin Inlet will give you the opportunity to see terrain which appears untouched by humans. Spring and summer brings wildlife like squirrels, which are everywhere, chattering incessantly from their perches, as do peregrine falcons and gyrfalcons. Keep a watchful eye on the area to see loons, geese, swans and cranes, which will keep photographers busy.
Ovayuk Territorial Park, east of Cambridge Bay, has 20 km of trails, camping areas and interpretive signage. Iqalugaarjuup Nunanga Territorial Park, near Rankin Inlet, includes the archaeological site of Thule.
In April, Rankin Inlet celebrates Pakallak Time with a sled race, snowmobile races, and igloo building.
Buy[edit]
Traditional crafts and carvings are the items to look out for. The Uqqurmiut Centre is an Inuit arts facility in Pangnirtung that sells local products.
Eat[edit]
Some towns may offer small restaurants or coffee shops.
Try some traditional Inuit food, such as raw seal meat. For many Inuit, hunting is still the primary way of acquiring food, so many northern foods can be bought from local fishers or hunters and cooked. Arctic char has been a staple food for thousands of years. It is a sustainable fish related to salmon and trout that is valued for its delicate taste, striking colour, and health benefits. Caribou meat.
The main grocers are Co-op and Northern, a common grocery for Nunavut. Because most food is shipped in on planes, be prepared to pay extraordinarily high prices for perishables, such as milk, fruit, and vegetables.
During the short summer, foraging for wild plants such as mountain sorrel, snow-bed willow, Labrador tea, lamb's quarter, violet and shepherd's purse has been an important supplement to the Inuit diet. Local berries include cranberries, cloudberries, blueberries, gooseberries and crowberries.
In Nunavut, any food that the land provides is called ""country food"": caribou, Arctic char, salmon, musk ox, seal, whale, seafood (fish, clams and mussels), Arctic hare and ptarmigan. Country food is often accompanied by imported sauces, such as soy sauce, or traditional sauces made from caribou or seal.
Drink[edit]
In many places in Nunavut there is a local law prohibiting all alcohol. Given the high rates of addiction and suicide in many places, communities have felt the need to adopt this extreme position. Do not bring any alcohol into an officially dry community, as you can exacerbate the local problems with alcohol abuse and even cause a person's death.
In other communities, local bars are permitted to operate. There are no local liquor stores outside Iqaluit; a warehouse in each of Rankin Inlet and Iqaluit will ship hard liquor outside the community but this must be ordered in advance.
Sleep[edit]
As with food, accommodation is very expensive in Nunavut. Expect to pay premium prices for fairly basic accommodation. For example, a B&B in Iqaluit, the largest town, starts at $130 a night.
Connect[edit]
Wireless network service are now available at towns and hamlets. Qiniq and Bell Mobility are the service providers. Despite government subsidy, rates are somewhat higher due to high maintenance cost associated with the cold weather and small customer base to distribute the cost. Satellite phones are better choice if you're outside of these settlements.
Stay safe[edit]
The cold weather and dangerous animals articles have advice which will be relevant to many travellers in the Arctic.

But with the discovery of diamonds in Nunavut in the early nineties, this hope became a reality that soon led to active exploration for the elusive gem throughout the country – specifically, on the Canadian Shield.
Canada became a diamond producer in October 1998, when the Ekati diamond mine opened about 300 kilometres northeast of Yellowknife. By April 1999, the mine had produced one million carats. And by 2003, the country became the world’s third largest diamond producer on a value basis, after Botswana and Russia.
Today, diamond exploration and discovery is undergoing a renaissance in Canada’s north that rivals the first wave of successful exploration. Most of the efforts are converging in Nunavut, the largest and newest territory of Canada.
Although the Canadian northern territories are not the easiest places in which to live and work, there are a number of junior and senior companies operating in these areas. These companies have to deal with harsh climates, limited infrastructure and a very fragile environment. But as demand for minerals, particularly diamonds, continues to grow, both new and established operators are taking a more active interest in the region.
Peregrine Diamonds Ltd. is one of the protagonists of the new success story. The company revitalized the diamond exploration scene last year, by reporting a remarkable discovery of three major outcropping diamond-bearing kimberlites at its Chidliak property on Baffin Island.
Chidliak, located 150 km northwest of Iqaluit, the capital of Nunavut and the company’s earlier stage Nanuq project, located 300 kilometres north of Rankin Inlet in Nunavut, are both textbook cases of grassroots or greenfields exploration low-budget programs that were taking place while attention was focused primarily on DO-27.
The Chidliak program began in 2005, when BHP Billiton approached Peregrine with an offer to jointly explore southern Baffin Island. “The agreement was that, together, we would undertake a reconnaissance program that covered roughly the southern third of Baffin Island. We would fund it equally and then Peregrine would take the data and run with it,” says Peregrine President, Brooke Clements.
After the programs’ first year, during which the most promising properties were acquired, the funding responsibility fell to Peregrine alone, but BHP retained back-in rights.
Despite being discovered a year earlier than Chidliak, Nanuq is currently at about the same stage, for two reasons. Three kimberlite pipes have been found on each site, but those at Nanuq, while encouraging, do not offer the promising diamond counts seen in kimberlites tested at Chidliak. Future exploration work at Nanuq will be focusing on finding new pipes. Meanwhile, the work at Chidliak will be split between searching out new pipes and continuing to estimate the value of the one already known to hold diamonds.
A bit of luck also favoured Chidliak. “Usually, kimberlites are covered by soil and aren’t visible from the surface,” explains Clements. “But in the case of Chidliak, the sampling crew went to three promising sites and found not just indications of kimberlites, but outcroppings of the pipes themselves exposed on the surface. We were fortunate because we kind of jumped a year ahead of the normal sequence. Without drilling a single hole, we know we have diamonds and kimberlites with significant tonnage potential on the property,” he said of the significance of the outcroppings.
Clements describes the results as “exceptional,” and not just because the coarse diamond size distribution indicates potential for large commercialization of diamonds. Unlike most diamond-bearing kimberlites in northern Canada, which typically occur under lakes or are buried by overburden, the Chidliak kimberlites outcrop on the surface.
.
“It’s still early days but we’re very excited by the potential as we’ve identified more than 65 geophysical anomalies within the property,” says Clements.
Key Players
Until recently, Tahera Diamond Corporation was the best known name in Nunavut’s diamond scene. The company runs Jericho Diamond Mine, Canada’s third diamond mine and Nunavut’s first, located about 400 km (249 mi) northeast of Yellowknife, Northwest Territories.
Two and a half years after that high-profile startup, Tahera has abruptly ended production at the Jericho mine, forcing Prime Minister Stephen Harper and his government to take over.
Deloitte and Touche has since been appointed as receiver and contracted to undertake care and maintenance at the mine.
It is doubtful that a new owner will soon be found for Jericho.
Other companies currently exploring for diamonds in Nunavut are Indicator Minerals (Nanuq North, in a join venture with Peregrine Diamonds), Shear Minerals (Churchill), Diamonds North Resources (Amaruk) and Stornoway Diamonds (Aviat).
Stornoway, a Vancouver-based exploration company, is the dominant diamond explorer in eastern Nunavut and it has property stretching from the northern tip of the Melville Peninsula to Rankin Inlet on the western shore of Hudson Bay.
Stornoway shares interest in the Aviat property with BHP Billiton – which owns the Ekati mine in the Northwest Territories – and the Hunter Exploration Group. Two of Stornoway’s holdings, Churchill and Quilalugaq, are in the advanced exploration stage.
Governmental Support
To maintain Nunavut’s position as a jurisdiction of choice for mineral investment, the local Government developed a strategy entitled “Parnautit: The Nunavut Mineral Exploration & Mining,” which provides a framework of policies and actions to encourage mineral discovery and development. Released in March 2007, the goal of Parnautit is to create the conditions for a “strong and sustainable minerals industry that contributes to a high and sustainable quality of life for all Nunavummiut.” The plan addresses Nunavut’s regulatory and taxation regimes, workforce training, infrastructure development and environmental baseline availability.
Peter Taptuna, Nunavut’s Deputy Premier and Minister Responsible for Mines, explains that Nunavut also offers a Development Partnership Agreement (DPA) program that was introduced in 2006 as a means of extending the territorial off-road fuel tax credit (rebate) to developing and producing mines. Through these DPAs, Nunavut’s Government and mine operators work cooperatively in areas such as education and training, socioeconomic monitoring and mitigation, as well as in infrastructure development. As the physical and economic circumstances of no two mines are alike, so too each DPA should reflect the unique and shared needs of the mine operator and the local population. Proponents entering the regulatory phase are encouraged to begin negotiations on a Development Partnership Agreement for their projects.
For now, the reality of the diamond industry is much like the weather conditions in Nunavut- harsh. In spite of this, the Canadian industry is up to the challenge. While current prices, logistical challenges, inclement weather, personnel shortages and training needs remain concerns, all signs point to Nunavut seeing growth in mining operations in the near future, just in time to offer its diamonds to an eager market.

The Chidliak program began in 2005, when BHP Billiton approached Peregrine with an offer to jointly explore southern Baffin Island. “The agreement was that, together, we would undertake a reconnaissance program that covered roughly the southern third of Baffin Island. We would fund it equally and then Peregrine would take the data and run with it,” says Peregrine President, Brooke Clements.
After the programs’ first year, during which the most promising properties were acquired, the funding responsibility fell to Peregrine alone, but BHP retained back-in rights.
Despite being discovered a year earlier than Chidliak, Nanuq is currently at about the same stage, for two reasons. Three kimberlite pipes have been found on each site, but those at Nanuq, while encouraging, do not offer the promising diamond counts seen in kimberlites tested at Chidliak. Future exploration work at Nanuq will be focusing on finding new pipes. Meanwhile, the work at Chidliak will be split between searching out new pipes and continuing to estimate the value of the one already known to hold diamonds.
A bit of luck also favoured Chidliak. “Usually, kimberlites are covered by soil and aren’t visible from the surface,” explains Clements. “But in the case of Chidliak, the sampling crew went to three promising sites and found not just indications of kimberlites, but outcroppings of the pipes themselves exposed on the surface. We were fortunate because we kind of jumped a year ahead of the normal sequence. Without drilling a single hole, we know we have diamonds and kimberlites with significant tonnage potential on the property,” he said of the significance of the outcroppings.
Clements describes the results as “exceptional,” and not just because the coarse diamond size distribution indicates potential for large commercialization of diamonds. Unlike most diamond-bearing kimberlites in northern Canada, which typically occur under lakes or are buried by overburden, the Chidliak kimberlites outcrop on the surface.
.
“It’s still early days but we’re very excited by the potential as we’ve identified more than 65 geophysical anomalies within the property,” says Clements.
Key Players
Until recently, Tahera Diamond Corporation was the best known name in Nunavut’s diamond scene. The company runs Jericho Diamond Mine, Canada’s third diamond mine and Nunavut’s first, located about 400 km (249 mi) northeast of Yellowknife, Northwest Territories.
Two and a half years after that high-profile startup, Tahera has abruptly ended production at the Jericho mine, forcing Prime Minister Stephen Harper and his government to take over.
Deloitte and Touche has since been appointed as receiver and contracted to undertake care and maintenance at the mine.
It is doubtful that a new owner will soon be found for Jericho.
Other companies currently exploring for diamonds in Nunavut are Indicator Minerals (Nanuq North, in a join venture with Peregrine Diamonds), Shear Minerals (Churchill), Diamonds North Resources (Amaruk) and Stornoway Diamonds (Aviat).
Stornoway, a Vancouver-based exploration company, is the dominant diamond explorer in eastern Nunavut and it has property stretching from the northern tip of the Melville Peninsula to Rankin Inlet on the western shore of Hudson Bay.
Stornoway shares interest in the Aviat property with BHP Billiton – which owns the Ekati mine in the Northwest Territories – and the Hunter Exploration Group. Two of Stornoway’s holdings, Churchill and Quilalugaq, are in the advanced exploration stage.
Governmental Support
To maintain Nunavut’s position as a jurisdiction of choice for mineral investment, the local Government developed a strategy entitled “Parnautit: The Nunavut Mineral Exploration & Mining,” which provides a framework of policies and actions to encourage mineral discovery and development. Released in March 2007, the goal of Parnautit is to create the conditions for a “strong and sustainable minerals industry that contributes to a high and sustainable quality of life for all Nunavummiut.” The plan addresses Nunavut’s regulatory and taxation regimes, workforce training, infrastructure development and environmental baseline availability.
Peter Taptuna, Nunavut’s Deputy Premier and Minister Responsible for Mines, explains that Nunavut also offers a Development Partnership Agreement (DPA) program that was introduced in 2006 as a means of extending the territorial off-road fuel tax credit (rebate) to developing and producing mines. Through these DPAs, Nunavut’s Government and mine operators work cooperatively in areas such as education and training, socioeconomic monitoring and mitigation, as well as in infrastructure development. As the physical and economic circumstances of no two mines are alike, so too each DPA should reflect the unique and shared needs of the mine operator and the local population. Proponents entering the regulatory phase are encouraged to begin negotiations on a Development Partnership Agreement for their projects.
For now, the reality of the diamond industry is much like the weather conditions in Nunavut- harsh. In spite of this, the Canadian industry is up to the challenge. While current prices, logistical challenges, inclement weather, personnel shortages and training needs remain concerns, all signs point to Nunavut seeing growth in mining operations in the near future, just in time to offer its diamonds to an eager market.

adventures,https://adventures.com/canada/regions/nunavut/ ,"Dramatic coastlines, Arctic wildlife, and Inuit culture await you in Canada’s newest territory of Nunavut. Established in 1999, Nunavut is the largest province in the country and represents Canada’s true Arctic. Although it’s the largest territory in area, Nunavut is also the least populated in Canada with only about 35,000 people, mostly of Inuit descent.
On our Nunavut guided tours, backpack the world's most remote areas, spot mythical narwhals, and cruise through the fabled Northwest Passage. If you thought that the great age of exploration on Earth was over, wait until you see the vastness of Nunavut. Shall we explore the world again?
Below find our Nunavut vacation packages grouped by activity.
Welcome to Nunavut, where you can fulfill all your explorer’s dreams.
The main feature of coastal Nunavut is, of course, the Arctic Ocean. The sea is abundant with wildlife and breathtaking scenery of winding glaciers and immense icecaps. From May to June, the floe edge — where the ocean meets the ice — becomes the world’s best place to spot whales, walrus, seals, and polar bears.
Many adventures include Inuit guides whose knowledge of the region, wildlife, and ecosystem will amaze you.
From May to June, the floe edge — where the ocean meets the ice — becomes the world’s best place to spot whales, walrus, seals, and polar bears.
With no roads linking its communities, the best way to explore Nunavut is by ship. Arctic cruises invite you to travel where few people ever get to go. Visit local communities and marvel at world-class Inuit art.
Possible stops along the way include Baffin Island, Devon Island, and Beechey Island, the location of the ill-fated Franklin expedition. For history buffs, cruises to retrace the route of the elusive Northwest Passage are also available.
The largest community in Nunavut is the capital city of Iqaluit on Baffin Island. As the centre of government and a growing community of local Inuit people, Nunavut is seldom explored, offering a true wilderness immersion. Start in the forest of the Precambrian Shield and embark on a journey through the Arctic tundra before ending at Hudson Bay.
Nunavut covers a large part of the Canadian mainland and the Arctic Archipelago. It extends about 1,700 km (1,050 mi) north and 11,000 km (6,800 mi) south of the Arctic Circle. You can cross the mythical line of the Arctic Circle on our exclusive Auyuittuq National Park tours.
Nunavut is not connected by road to the rest of Canada. Most visitors travel to Nunavut and between its communities by air. There are regularly scheduled flights from Ottawa, Montréal, Winnipeg, Churchill, Edmonton, Calgary, and Yellowknife. Major airlines are Canadian North, Calm Air, and First Air.
Our Nunavut travel packages include charter flights between smaller Nunavut communities. We also take care of all ground transportation and boat travel during the tours. Round trip flights from Ottawa to Nunavut can be added to the package for an additional cost.
Cruise enthusiasts can board our grand Ocean Endeavour cruise ship and reach Nunavut communities by sea. Expect to navigate among the icebergs and see Arctic animals en route. Arctic cruises offer adventures beyond anything you’ve ever imagined!
Nunavut is Canada’s true north, so make sure to pack enough warm and windproof layers. However, summers in Nunavut are warmer than you might expect. During the season, temperatures range from 10°C (50°F) to 20°C (68°F). You might be lucky enough to wear shorts and t-shirts in the far Canadian north. But let’s not forget that Arctic weather is ever-changing and temperatures can quickly fall below zero, especially at night.
You might be lucky enough to wear shorts and t-shirts in the far Canadian north.
In general, Nunavut sees little precipitation through the year. Always be prepared for cold and dry temperatures.
The good news is that you’ll get to experience the Midnight Sun — a remarkable natural phenomenon when the sun stays visible at midnight — during the summer months. Enjoy sunlight for the full 24 hours on our summer trips to Nunavut.
Insider tip: Think of Nunavut’s summers as spring seasons farther south in Canada.
What Travelers Ask About Nunavut?
October to April are the best months for aurora viewing in Nunavut, providing the clearest skies. If you want to avoid the freezing cold, consider traveling in early spring or fall when the weather is milder and the lights are still very active. See the elusive aurora and the great caribou migration on our Autumn Caribou Migration & Northern Lights tour.
During the winter months, the temperature ranges from -10 °C (14°F) to -35°C (-31°F). The coldest place in Nunavut is Grise Fiord, where the winter temperature can go as low as -50°C (-58°F).
Though most of the territory is frozen and snow-covered most of the year, summers in Nunavut can be surprisingly mild. In the warmest regions, the temperature can jump to as high as 30°C (86°F). However, such hot days are rather a rarity than the norm. Average summer temperatures range from 10°C (50°F) to 20°C (68°F).
Back in the late 1960s and early 1970s, the rise of Inuit political awareness paved the way towards self-government. Thanks to political organization and effort, Nunavut successfully addressed land claims and split from the Northwest Territories in 1999. Thus Nunavut became Canada’s largest and newest territory.
Nunavut is one of the most sparsely populated territories on Earth with a population of just 35,944 according to the 2016 Canada Census.
Living on the top of the world is everything but ordinary. Nunavut communities are not connected by roads, meaning locals travel by plane or boat. As you might imagine, getting food transported to the Arctic is not an easy task. In summer, a sealift brings supplies for the whole year. The same holds true for oil supply, as an oil tanker comes only once a year. While some homes have piped water, smaller communities rely on daily water deliveries by a water truck.
It might come as a surprise, but Iqaluit, Nunavut’s capital city, has Tim Hortons, an iconic Canadian coffee and doughnut chain.
No, the territory's 26 communities are not connected by roads. The main means of transportation are aircraft, boats, snowmobiles, and all-terrain vehicles. . ",False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False
whenonearth,https://whenonearth.net/mt-thor-nunavut-canada-earths-greatest-vertical-drop/ ,"Mount Thor, a little different than the superhero hailing from Asgard, resides in beautiful Canada. Of course, we know the mountain’s namesake, Thor, the all-powerful Norse God, whose strength comes from thunder. Known for its amazing mountain range and miraculous sites, Mt. Thor lives up to its name and does not disappoint.
It makes its home in Nunavut, Canada. Now, most people have no idea where that is, but it’s the northernmost part of Canada and also the newest. We can bet you’ll freeze your fingers off up there, but it’s worth it.
The mountain sits on Nunavut’s Baffin Island and is, hands down, the world’s longest vertical drop. Mount Thor is a whopping almost 2,000 meters (that’s a little under 5,000 feet!) long vertically. It’s on a long line of the Baffin Mountains, making up a portion of the Arctic Cordillera Mountains.
Officially known as Thor Peak, this mountain is the feat of the brave. Climbers come from all over to brace the chilly weather and hike up the jaw-dropping granite of Mt. Thor.
The terrain is filled with glaciers, and although the mountain has a consistency for remoteness, it actually sees quite a few campers and avid daredevils that want to tackle it.
What’s interesting especially about Mt. Thor is that there are tons of peaks and fjords. It has an overhang of about a hundred degrees, making it incredibly steep.
Seriously, this mountain is no joke when it comes to climbing. Many attempts were made, but it wasn’t until an American team, with almost a ton of food and supplies, decided to scale it that there was a success.
Along with plunging debris and unpredictability of gear, the climbers had to persist and made the climb to the top in 33 days. Yeah, that’s over a month! It also doesn’t help that Mt. Thor has frequent rockfalls.
Different activities are also available near or on the mountain, like paragliding and parachuting of Thor’s tremendous heights. Any good climber knows that climbing season is approaching, so that means Mt. Thor will be getting a lot of action in August. The summer months are the best time to get outdoors and start climbing things!
Although, it isn’t as impenetrable as Mount Asgard (yes, there’s a whole team of mountains named after Marvel comic book characters up there), climbing Mt. Thor isn’t a walk in the park.
This isn’t a trek for beginners, but maybe climbers with more experience should pursue. Regardless of which route one takes up the mountain, they’ll face a few hiccups and that can make things very dangerous.
Whenever attempting to rock climb, it’s important to take into consideration certain necessary precautions. Mt. Thor and its surrounding areas have limited supervision, so you’ve got to rely on good old common sense and survival skills when you get out there.

Celebrating 50 years of WWF:
In a campaign spanning 26 years, WWF-Canada

In a campaign spanning 26 years, WWF-Canada
worked with the Inuit community of Clyde River to create Canada’s first national Marine Wildlife Area. Also known as Niginganiq, this extensive area off the coast of Baffin Island, Nunavut, became a sanctuary for bowhead whales in 2008.
“Isabella Bay is a pristine late summer and fall, feeding and resting stop for many of the Davis Strait-Baffin Bay bowhead whale population,” Mike Russill, then CEO of WWF-Canada said at the time. “This is not only a day to celebrate the protection of the threatened bowhead whale, but also to celebrate a community effort led from the beginning by the Inuit of Clyde River.”
At the community’s request, WWF-Canada invested over $1 million for scientific studies and to support Inuit requests for protection of this important area. WWF also negotiated with all levels of government and Inuit organisations to develop a management plan for this magnificent northern bay.
The sanctuary includes two deep offshore troughs that are rich in a type of crustacean known as copepods which are a main food source for the 18 metre-long, 70-tonne bowhead whale. A shallow shelf at the entrance to the bay provides protection from predatory orca whales.
Polar bears, ringed seals, Arctic char, halibut, narwhal, Canada geese, snow geese and king eider also benefit from the sanctuary.
Also referred to as Isabella Bay or Igaliqtuuq, an estimated 1,500 to 2,000 bowhead whales stop over in Niginganiq. Bowhead whales can live for over 200 years, making them the longest-lived wild mammal on the planet.
Thought to once number in the tens of thousands, surveys from 2003 found an estimated 1,500-2,000 bowheads in the Davis Strait-Baffin Bay population.

energyhub,https://www.energyhub.org/nunavut/ ,"Complete Guide For Solar Power Nunavut 2020
Congratulations! You’ve found the ultimate guide for going solar in Nunavut!
Nunavut is currently ranked the #10 province/territory in the country for installing a solar power system, but scores as the best province/territory for utility-related factors.
This page contains all relevant information about installing solar in Nunavut including utility policies, system financing, solar incentives, and natural factors – updated as of May 1st, 2020.
This guide is sponsored by Solvest Inc., a residential and commercial solar developer serving all of Nunavut. Click here to visit their website and to get a free cost estimate.
The guide begins by answering the two most common questions about solar systems, then it explores each solar ranking factor.
You can read from top to bottom, or skip to your preferred section by clicking on it below:
Common Solar Questions
When thinking about solar power, the first two questions that often come to a person’s mind are:
- “How big does my system need to be?”
- “How much will it cost?”
You can answer these questions in three basic steps:
1. Sizing Your System
To determine the size of system that you need, you only need to know how much energy you use during the course of a year. Your monthly Qulliq Energy Power Bill will show your usage (in kWh) similar to the photo below:
You can calculate your annual energy by adding up the amount shown for 12 consecutive months. Don’t make the mistake of multiplying a single month by 12 – usage fluctuates greatly depending on the season.
You can calculate the size of the solar power system that you’ll need with the following equation:
Size of system needed (kW) = yearly energy use (kWh) / annual equivalent full sunlight hours (h)
(annual average ‘equivalent full sunlight hours’ in Nunavut = 1,092h)
For example, let’s pretend that you added up your power bills and determined that you use 10,000kWh over the course of a year. You would then do the above calculation and determine that you need a 9.16kW solar panel system!
10,000kWh / 1,092h = 9.16kW
2. Physical Sizing
Now that you know the size of your system in units of kW, you can determine how much space the system will require by converting it to units of sqft.
The average solar panel is approximately 18sqft in size (including some buffer room for racking and spacing) and produces about 300watts of power.
The equation to calculate the space that your solar system require is again simple:
Physical space required = size of system needed (in kW) / size of panel (in kW) * physical size of panel (in sqft)
(average size of panel = 0.3kW, average physical panel size = 18sqft)
Let’s continue from the previous section and assume that you need a 9.16kW system. You would do the above calculation and determine that you need 550sqft of space to install your system!
9.16kW / 0.3kW * 18sqft = 550sqft
(note that 300watts equals 0.3kW)
If you’re putting solar panels on your roof, you should know that:
- A south facing roof is best, east and west facing are good, but north is not great
- You may need to replace your shingles (or entire roof) before installing – because panels are guaranteed for 25 years!
If you’re putting solar panels on the ground, you should know that:
- These systems are more expensive upfront due to piling, mounting , and trenching requirements
- They are more efficiency because they can be easily placed to the optimal direction (south), the optimal angle (~45°), and to avoid shading
- Thus, these systems are more efficient and have better lifetime IRRs and NPVs.
Most residential homeowners in Nunavut put solar panels on their roof. Rural property owners put systems on the roof of their house or shop – or on the ground in their yard.
3. System Costs
The last piece of basic information that you’ll want to know is an approximation of how much your system will cost. To calculate this, you just need to know the size of the system in units of kW.
The rough calculation is simple. Just take the size of your system and multiply it by the $4.00/watt – the average cost of installing a solar system in Nunavut.
You can calculate your total system costs with the following equation:
System cost = size of system needed x cost per installed watt
Continuing with our previous example, we can see that a 9.16kW system would cost approximately $36,640 to install.
= 9,160watts x $4.00/watt
= $36,640
Note that the exact price of the system depends on several factors including the system size, the quality of equipment used, and the complexity of the job.
Even the range in the chart above is just an average – installation prices can easily go as high as $5.00+/watt for premium equipment and high quality installers.

Overall Ranking
Every year, we score every province and territory in Canada on the relative feasibility of installing a solar power system. This year, Nunavut scores #10, receiving a total score of 62/100.
The remainder of this guide explores each ranking factor individually, while also providing important information about installing solar in Nunavut.
(if you want to learn how we score each factor, please visit our Provincial Solar Rankings page)
Solar Incentives
Major Program: Forgivable Loan
Savings: Varies
Nunavut does not currently have any solar incentive programs, but there are some energy efficiency incentives. These factors are important because they reduce the upfront system costs. We’ve scored Nunavut 5/20 for this section.
Rebates & Tax Breaks
Unfortunately, there are no solar rebate programs in Nunavut.
Other Energy Incentives
Nunavut does have some other incentive programs available, though:
- Home Renovation ProgramFor Nunavut ResidentsForgivable loan up to $50,000 for energy efficiency upgrades
Businesses can now use the Federal Tax Provision for Clean Energy Equipment to fully expense their solar system. This means a CCA rate of 100% and the abolishment of the first year rule.
Natural Factors
Production Potential: 1092kWh per kW per year
Nunavut is scores somewhere in the middle in terms of the natural factors that influence the maximal amount of energy that a system can produce. We’ve scored Nunavut 16.5/20 for this section.
Solar Irradiance
Nunavut has a moderate potential to produce solar energy in all of Canada, receiving more solar irradiation than any many provinces, as well as both the Northwest Territories and the Yukon.
According to data from Natural Resources Canada, the average solar system in Nunavut can produce 1092kWh of electricity per kW of solar panels per year.
Here is how much an average solar system can produce each month, as well as the solar irradiance potential map for Nunavut:
This yearly average decreases as you move north in the province and increases as you move south. For example, a 1kW solar system in:
- Iqaluit would produce about 1,057 kWh/yr
- Rankin Inlet would produce about 1,150 kWh/yr
- Arviat would produce about 1,144 kWh/yr
- Baker Lake would produce about 1,109 kWh/yr
- Igloolik would produce 999 kWh/yr
Recall that this is the number we used in the System Sizing section!
(maps and solar irradiance data for all other provinces and territories can be found on our Solar Maps page.)
Utility Policies
Connection Policy: Net Metering
Rate Design: $0.375/kWh, Tiered
Nunavut is the best province/territory when it comes to utility-related factors.
Utility factors determine how much money your utility will pay you for the power you produce, along with how much money you will save on your power bill by reducing your usage. We’ve scored Nunavut 29/30 for this section.
Interconnection Policy
Net Metering is one of the most important policy mechanisms that makes solar a feasible energy generation option.
Net Metering essentially means that you earn credits for the excess energy that you produce, which can then be used at a later time. It’s common to produce excess energy during the day and summer but not enough at night and during the winter – so this policy is important!
Good net metering policy allows you to earn full credits for your excess energy which can be carried month-to-month. Bad net metering policy allows you to earn only partial credits for excess energy and credits can’t be carried forward month-to-month.
Disconnecting from the grid also means that you won’t be able to participate in your utility’s net metering program.
Qulliq Energy Corps Net Metering Program falls in the “good” category for net metering policies. It allows for systems up to 10kW in size to be connected to the grid and credits can be carried forward month-to-month.
However, it’s important to note that net-metering credits in Nunavut expire yearly on March 31st. Thus, you’ll want to work closely with your installer to make sure your system perfectly matches your energy usage.
Solar Setup Fees
Qulliq Energy Corps Net Metering Program dictates that you don’t need to pay for an interconnection study or a bi-directional meter when you switch to solar power.
This is opposed to many provinces and both other territories NWT and YT where costly fees must be paid!
Electricity Prices
Nunavut is one of the better provinces/territories for solar with respect to electricity prices – higher prices mean higher savings potential.
Based on a monthly usage of 1,000kWh, the average total cost of electricity in Nunavut is $0.375/kWh (this number includes both fixed and variable costs).
This number is higher than the Canadian average of $0.138/kWh (excluding the territories), meaning that property owners in Nunavut have a lot of potential savings!
(methodology and data on other provinces and territories can be found on our Electricity Prices page.)
Utility Bill Rate Design
Good electricity rate design allows you to save money when you save energy. This might sound intuitive – but not all provinces are same. Superior designs have low fixed monthly fees and tiered electricity rates. Inferior designs have high fixed fees and flat electricity rates.
Nunavut is the best province/territory when it comes to these factors – having tiered rates and fixed monthly fees of $0 (when accounting for electricity rebates).
For example, reducing your electricity bill from 1,500 to 750 kWh per month will save you 72% on your electricity bill in Nunavut, 49% in Quebec, but only 46% in Newfoundland and Labrador!
(methodology on our Electricity Prices page.)
The only way to completely remove your fixed costs is to go off the grid, something most homeowners in Nunavut don’t do because of high battery costs.
Disconnecting from the grid also means that you won’t be able to participate in your utility’s net metering program.
System Financing
Upfront Cost: $4.00+/watt
Financing: Forgivable Loan
Nunavut is one of the worst provinces in the country when it comes to financial factors because of high up-front costs and limited solar financing options. We’ve scored Nunavut 11.5/30 for this section.
Cost of Installation
The upfront cost of installation is obviously one of the largest factors that determine whether or not a person is going to switch to solar. The current average price range in Nunavut is about $4.00+/kWh.
(not sure what this number means or how to use it? Jump back up to the Common Questions section.)
However, the price can easily be higher or lower depending on the size of the system, the complexity of the job, the type of equipment used, and even on the quality of your installation company.
In general, aiming for the cheapest price shouldn’t be your goal. Most solar panels are guaranteed to last for 25 years, so you want to make sure that your installation job is good enough to support that.
You’ll also want to be sure that the company you choose will be around in 5 to 10 years from now in case you need service or warranty work done. If you get a quote through us, we’ll connect you with a pre-vetted installer!
PACE Programs
Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) is an innovative financing option that allows you to cover the entire upfront cost of your solar system (or energy efficiency upgrades) with a $0 down, long amortization period, low interest ‘loan’.
However, unlike a typical loan, this loan is attached to your property (not you) and is paid back on your property tax bill as a Local Improvement Charge (LIC). The only eligibility is that you need to own a certain portion of your home.
Unfortunately, no PACE financing exists in Nunavut.
Other Energy Financing
Obviously though, PACE is not the only way to finance a solar system. Systems can be financed by cash, bank loans, installer financing, home equity loans, a home equity line of credit, a mortgage (for new builds), or through energy loans.
Several options exist for Nunavut homeowners:
- Home Renovation Program (energy loan)Forgivable Loan
- RBC Energy Saver Loan (energy loan)Up to 10 years amortizationRBC contact number: 1-800-769-2511
- TD Bank (various options)TD contact number: 1-866-389-8888
Solar Power Nunavut
Because of Nunavut’s high installation costs and low incentives – we rank Nunavut as being the #10 province/territory in the country for switching to solar power.

Local & tasty: Arctic char
Prized for its delicate taste, striking colour, sustainability and health benefits, Arctic char is becoming increasingly popular in fish markets and on menus across Canada. But in Nunavut, Arctic char has been a staple food for thousands of years.
Closely related to salmon and trout, Arctic char is a saltwater and freshwater fish that thrives in the deep, icy waters of Canada's North. Like salmon and trout, Arctic char flesh can range in colour from pale pink to deep coral red, depending on the season, and the diet and location of the fish.
There are small wild-caught Arctic char fishing camps, fish farms and processing plants based in Nunavut (and in other provinces and territories across the country). These support local economies and the communities that consume Arctic char regularly. SeaChoice, Canada's leading sustainable seafood program, lists Arctic char as a ""best choice"" fish.
Arctic char is not only good for the environment; like salmon and trout, it's high in healthy omega-3 fats. This high fat content helps people stay healthy in the cold climate of Canada's North, where a higher-fat diet is said to warm the body.
In Nunavut, fresh or frozen Arctic char is often enjoyed raw. Northern cooks also use traditional Inuit cooking techniques, including smoking and drying, to preserve the fish. Modern cooking techniques have also become popular, and Arctic char's firm, fatty flesh makes it ideal for grilling, roasting and pan-frying

Foraging
In Nunavut, summer only lasts about eight weeks. But with the sun burning brightly for up to 20 hours a day, the thin layer of soil that thaws comes alive with brightly coloured wildflowers, mosses, grasses, lichens and berry plants -- many of which are edible.
Traditionally, these wild plants were picked and eaten to complement the protein-heavy Inuit diet. Like most fruits and vegetables, they contain essential vitamins and minerals that aren't abundant in meat or fish.
Today, foraged wild plants are still an important part of local diets. Some wild plants commonly eaten are mountain sorrel, snow-bed willow, Labrador tea, lamb's quarter, violet and shepherd's purse. Local berries include cranberries, cloudberries, blueberries, gooseberries and crowberries.
When foraging, always consult a guidebook or, preferably, an elder who knows his or her way around the tundra. Many safe-to-eat plants closely resemble toxic ones. Elders with many years of foraging experience can also share useful information on how best to use the plant.
Country food
About 85 per cent of Nunavut's population is of Inuit descent, so the territory's culture is strongly tied to Inuit culture and traditions. And food is no exception.
For generations, the Inuit relied on the land and surrounding waters for sustenance; they hunted, fished and gathered seasonal plants. In Nunavut, the term ""country food"" is used to describe any food that the land supplies, including caribou, Arctic char, salmon, musk ox, seal, whale, seafood (including clams and mussels), Arctic hare and ptarmigan. There are also some edible leaves, grasses and berries.
These days, southern staples -- fresh fruits, fresh vegetables and canned or processed foods -- are flown in and readily available. They tend to be expensive and are often not top quality, so more than 70 per cent of the adults in Nunavut still harvest and eat country food.
Country food is usually enjoyed frozen and/or raw, dipped in a variety of sauces. Today, soy sauce is a favourite, but diners also enjoy traditional sauces made from caribou or seal. Menus also include many types of dried fish and meat, which offer contrasting textures and flavours.
But country food isn't always enjoyed the traditional way. Modern recipes have evolved that fuse country food with spices, flavourings and cooking techniques that are more familiar in southern Canada. Tasty options include caribou kabobs and burgers, and fish and chips.
No matter what people eat, sharing and community are central to Inuit food culture. Celebrations always include a feast, because people believe that food tastes better when shared with family and friends. Food is also thought to turn strangers into friends and to increase harmony. Some also say that food doubles in volume when shared -- a lovely sentiment no matter where you eat.

Spotlight: Project Nunavut
In July 2010, William Hyndman realized it was time to stop making excuses and start making things happen. The result? Project Nunavut, a community-oriented, Iqaluit-based organization focused on growing traditional markets.
A resident of Nunavut since 2005, Hyndman noticed the difficulties hunters had selling their catch and people had trying to buy traditional foods.
Hyndman hopes to fill growing gaps in Inuit culture by supporting traditional economic activities in the territory, such as harvesting local fish and game, and developing studios for traditional arts and crafts. ""It is hard to overstate the importance of food to any culture, and it is also hard to overstate the importance of the principle of self-reliance for the Inuit and especially for hunters,"" he says.
Project Nunavut primarily creates a country market where hunters can sell their food directly to consumers. The inspiration came from similar markets in Greenland. The market gives sellers and buyers the chance to meet and solve problems together.
Since the first market in November 2010, each subsequent one has had a larger attendance than the last. Volunteers set up tents and tables, with the help of local government and hunting organizations, and hungry shoppers pick up their favourite foods: nipku (dried caribou), clams, maktaaq (whale skin), seal meat, berries, caribou stew, bannock and char. The food is often sold out half an hour before the posted start time, and some hunters don't even have the chance to set up their tables.
Looking ahead, Hyndman and his team are working hard to make sure that markets happen on a regular (hopefully monthly) basis. They're exploring ways of bettering infrastructure for hunters to increase the amount and range of foods on offer -- good news for hunters and country-food consumers in Nunavut.

smartertravel,https://www.smartertravel.com/canada-nature-adventure-northwest-territories-nunavut/ ,"From the sky-high trees and brown bears in British Columbia to the kitchen parties and codfish-kissing in the Maritimes, our toast to Canada offers plenty of reasons to take the trip. For December, we’re exploring a glimpse of the far north with a look at the Northwest Territories and Nunavut.
Northwest Territories and Nunavut
The Cities: Yellowknife and Iqaluit
Yellowknife, Northwest Territories
There are about 43,000 people who call the Northwest Territories home. Among them you’ll hear 11 official languages, most of which belong to Canada’s First Nations. In the capital city of Yellowknife, you’ll find the majority of the population along with a city as worthy of attention as any across the country. Pop into the Prince of Wales Northern Heritage Centre, walk the Frame Lake Trail, or take a self-guided tour of Old Town. The mix of skyscrapers and sailboats, and of log-cabins and ice palaces are just the beginning of experiences waiting to be had in this gorgeous corner of the world.
Iqaluit, Nunavut
Nunavut is a hard territory to overlook: It makes up about one fifth of the country’s total landmass and is the size of Western Europe. Despite being the largest of the regions, it remains the least populated with only about 33,000 inhabitants. That’s the equivalent of one person for every 25 square miles. Getting around isn’t easy: There are no roads that will get you here; you’ll need to rely on air or sea. But what it lacks in ease of access it makes up for in stunning beauty. In the capital city of Iqaluit, you can choose between dog sleds and skis in the winter and incredible hiking options in the summer. Year-round the city—which sits on Baffin Island—is the hub. Everything from politics and local affairs to cultural celebrations and community events are centered here. Despite the fact that Nunavut makes up the vast majority of Canada’s Arctic Archipelago and is home to the country’s most vast land spaces, Iqualuit remains a friendly, welcoming destination where once-in-a-lifetime opportunities await travelers.
Why December Is the Perfect Time to Go
The Northern Lights: Both territories offer fantastic opportunities to view the Aurora Borealis. Travelers can check in with Astronomy North to get a sense of weather conditions (and the likelihood of glimpsing the lights) on any given night. At Aurora Village, you’re outfitted with warm gear and brought out to heated teepees to take in the night sky. Or book with an outfitter like Blachford Lake Lodge that boasts its own night watch. They’ll wake you up when the lights appear. In Nunavut, try Arctic Haven Wilderness Lodge—a five-star offering on the Arctic tree line.
Winter Fun: Take a turn as a musher on a dog-sled across frozen waters, learn to ice-fish and then dine on your catch … when you live this far north, there’s no escaping the fun that winter can bring. Snowshoeing, cross country skiing, and winter camping are all family-friendly options across the territories. Dress for the weather (temperatures can dip FAR below zero) and you may find winter is your season after all.
Why It’s Great Other Times of Year
Out on the Water: In the Northwest Territories, you can book a private fishing tour of Yellowknife Bay that comes with a local shore lunch, or head out for a cruise of Great Slave Lake. Looking for something a little longer? Consider Adventure Canada’s “The Heart of the Arctic” cruise expedition, which explores Nunavut as well as Quebec’s Nunavik region, Greenland, and the Davis Strait.
Aboriginal Experiences: Who better to show you around the North than members of a 100 percent Aboriginal-owned tour company who’ve long called the area home? North Star Adventures is based in Yellowknife and prides itself on knowing the best spots to catch the Aurora. They’ll also teach you to capture the fast-moving lights on your camera. Join the company’s Aboriginal Culture Tour to take a snow hike out to an Aboriginal culture camp where you’ll learn about the history, traditions, and challenges of keeping their way of life alive and thriving in the modern day.
Catch the Reindeer Migration: Every year in early spring, “Canada’s greatest reindeer herd” moves from winter grounds to summer digs closer to the Beaufort Sea.
Summer Solstice: The summer solstice—when long, dark winter nights give way to long periods of daylight—is one of the most festive times of year up north. It’s also a great time to visit as it offers you some of the best opportunities to see the wildlife. Animals ranging from polar bears and musk ox to whales can all be spotted in the area. Best of all, the daylight months are also when most local Nunavut celebrations take place. Traditional Inuit performing arts including storytelling, throat-singing, and drum dancing are well worth seeing. And the annual “Inuit games”—an Olympics of sorts that includes athletic and mental stamina-based competitions—is incredible to behold.
The National Parks
The national parks that make up Canada’s far north aren’t for the novice. Without the right skills, or at least the assistance of a good outfitter and guide, a tourist could find themselves in real trouble. The rewards, when done right, are memorable: incredible wildlife, once-in-a-lifetime interactions with indigenous people, and access to pristine lands and waters.
Nahanni, NWT
Paddlers love Nahanni. The National Park Reserve is full of mountains, forest and tundra to explore. But it’s the South Nahanni River that gets canoers, kayakers, and rafters drooling. Winding its way through deep caverns and fast rapids, past moose, bear, and caribou, it’s the stuff adventures are made of. The park is best visited between June and August when flood waters have subsided and the weather is warmer. Not a paddler? Then strap on your boots and hike through the mountains, forest and tundra with views of waterfalls and those paddlers being batted around below.
Sirmilik, Nunavut
There’s no question that national parks in the region are remote—it’s both their difficulty and their charm. Sirmilik—“place of glaciers” in Inuktitut (an Inuit language)—is on the northern tip of Baffin Island. You’ll see the most if you visit in the spring or summer (May – September) when you’ll have the benefit of the round-the-clock sun. And if you can take the temperatures, diving adventures await under the sea ice and hold the potential of a beluga whale or narwhal encounter. Neighboring communities of Pond Inlet and Arctic Bay mean you can also get a sense of the traditions and culture of the local people.

GEOTHERMAL FAVOURABILITY MAPS, Project Report, AND DATABASE:
Nunavut is largest and northernmost territory of Canada with population of 38,456 spread out over 25 isolated communities. Qulliq Energy Corporation (QEC) owns and operates diesel-powered generating stations to supply electricity for Nunavut communities. QEC funded a geothermal feasibility study for the territory of Nunavut.
The Nunavut Geothermal Feasibility study is the first phase in identifying potential geothermal resources to help offset the use of diesel for electricity & heat in the isolated communities of Nunavut. The objectives of this study were to gather existing data, identify data gaps, and conduct a geothermal resource assessment based on the existing data. The framework, methodology, and deliverables of the assessment are designed around the reporting guidelines that were set by the Canadian Geothermal Energy Association (CanGEA) for the Canadian National Geothermal Database (CNGD) [Canadian Geothermal Code Committee, 2010].
Key findings from report:
- The geothermal potential of Nunavut is generally considered to be low compared to other provinces and territories. This is partially driven by the absence of data necessary to characterize the resource potential in Nunavut.
- Any geothermal development would need to occur at or near the isolated communities as there is no infrastructure to support energy transfer and resource temperatures will not support large scale power production.
- The territory is divided into two major geological regions and the geothermal resource is defined by those regions. The Arctic Basins region in the northwestern area of Nunavut is a sedimentary geothermal resource and has been preliminary characterized by oil and gas exploration.
- The Canadian Shield region will require a Enhanced Geothermal System (EGS) at depths of 5 km – 7km to reach temperatures suitable for binary power generation and direct use heating.
- The general Global Protocol methodology was used for this study with some modifications due to the absence of data. Theoretical and technical potential was calculated across the entire Territory of Nunavut regardless of data availability. Due to lack of data, values were estimated based on rock type, which included the entirety of the Canadian Shield region
- Under the Canadian Code for Public Reporting, generated resource maps are considered to have low confidence. No areas were considered to meet the minimum resource category of an inferred resource.
- Additional data collection is a key next step needed to properly define geothermal resource potential in Nunavut. It is recommended that Nunavut prioritize the drilling small diameter geothermal gradient wells at target communities to depths below the permafrost to measure subsurface thermal properties.
- Potential application of hybrid solar thermal – binary geothermal power production may be cost effective and increase overall power production. A thick permafrost, >500 meters, is a challenging heat sink that can be overcome with unique well bore designs. Enhanced Geothermal Systems are being developed around the world but economic and sustainability challenges remain.

Nunavut home owners can take advantage of QEC’s residential net metering program to tie into the grid. This means if you’re producing more power then you’re using (typical in summer) you can feed power back to the grid and build up credits. These credits can then be used at a later point in time when you’re using more power than you’re producing (typical in winter).
Save 50% or up to $30,000 with Government Subsidies
The Government of Nunavut has announced plans for a rebate program to subsidize the cost of solar for both homes and cabins.
IPP Program for Commercial and Industrial Solar
QEC’s IPP program allows businesses to take part in the solar revolution by connecting and selling power back to the grid.
Let Powertec Solar Plan and Install your Solar Panels
Residential and commercial solar panels have been popular in southern areas for over a decade, but up until recently the technology wasn’t available to create solar panels that were efficient enough to produce a payoff in northern locations. Over the last 5 years however, solar panels have become more efficient and have decreased in price by over 80% making solar in Nunavut a viable and economical solution for residents.

Solar Power in Nunavut
Renewable energy and energy independence have become hot-button topics in our society. The need to create efficient energy production systems while mitigating harm to the environment is keenly felt throughout the world, and Nunavut is certainly no exception. Since 1947, the average temperature in Nunavut has increased by 2.7 degrees, and thawing permafrost has threatened infrastructure, building foundations, archaeological sites and land-based travel. The unique flora and fauna of the region are also threatened by changes to the climate.
The Quilliq Energy Corporation (QEC) is Nunavut’s sole supplier of energy; it operates 25 independent power grids for each of the territory’s communities. Nunavut is Canada’s largest region; it is, however, sparsely populated, so creating an interconnected territory-wide grid is not economically feasible. QEC relies almost entirely on diesel fuel imports to run it’s power generators; this is both costly and environmentally unsustainable. The independent grid system is also at risk, because when a power failure occurs it’s impossible to transfer power from another grid to sustain energy supply; QEC relies instead on emergency power generators when things go awry.
The price of importing the fuel to sustain these systems is extremely high, as Nunavummiut who have exceeded the subsidy limit and paid QEC unsubsidized rates know all too well. The WWF has estimated that an average of $60.5 million dollars worth of subsidy money is used each year to keep the cost of electricity reasonable. The costs of fossil fuel, both in terms of real dollars and in terms of environmental impact seem unfeasible, and reliance on QEC’s power generators can be problematic, so Nunavut must find a sustainable method of producing electricity reliably in it’s independent grids. The solution? Solar panels.
There was a point in time where solar panels would not have been practical in Nunavut; northern regions especially don’t get as much sunlight as older photovoltaic cells required to generate energy. New technologies have increased the capacity of these cells to convert solar power into usable electricity, and panels have recently been installed on Iqaluit’s power plant to prove the concept. QEC has also introduced a net metering program, which is one of two great incentives for Nunavummiut to install solar panels. The other incentive comes from the Nunavut Housing Corporation (NHC) in the form of a forgivable loan of up to $15,000 through the Home Renovation Program (HRP) for the costs of installing new energy efficient technologies.
Combining the net metering program with the HRP can generate tremendous savings for Nunavummiut. The net metering program allows you to transfer energy from your solar panels into the grid, and QEC will compensate you for every kilowatt-hour transferred by giving a credit on your account that can be used at a later date. The Government of Canada conducted a study on how much solar energy photovoltaic cells absorb per municipality; on average, a 5 kW solar system in Nunavut will produce 5579 kWh of electricity per year. The average consumption of electricity per capita in Nunavut is 5100 kWh, so a 5 kW system would in most cases offset your entire electrical bill for the year! After subsidy, power bills are often around 30 cents per kWh; that means savings of around 1530$/year; it can be substantially more if you’re paying unsubsidized rates! Note that in the winter months, you’ll get less solar energy, so the credits will be less substantial; that works out just fine, though. QEC allows you to roll over credits so when you create more electricity than you consume in a given month, you can use the extra credits in the following month. That means electricity you produce during the summer can be credited back during the winter, when your energy consumption will be higher!
There’s no doubt that using solar panels in Nunavut can cut your QEC bill down to zero, but the cost of installing them can be a bit intimidating. That’s where the NHC forgivable loan comes in; $15,000 will take a hefty chunk out of the cost of installing solar panels. There are a few conditions you want to be aware of; first, the subsidy comes in the form of a forgivable loan. Essentially, the loan does not have to be repaid if the conditions of the Loan Agreement are met. To be eligible, your home must be at least five years old. The full terms of the program can be found here.
QEC and NHC officials confirmed that the two subsidies can, in fact, be used in tandem to drastically offset the price of your energy. The NHC incentive only applies to residential installations. Businesses, conversely, can apply for a federal tax incentive, allowing them to deduct renewable expenses as capital costs at a rate of 100% in the first year, depending on the project, which coupled with the net metering program means drastic savings.
The increased use of solar energy in Nunavut will have drastic, lasting and positive implications for the territory and its citizens. Reducing reliance on imported fossil fuels will boost the territory’s independence, and help mitigate the effects of climate change. Citizens with solar panels and battery backup systems will be less reliant on grids that have central fault points; solar panels and battery backup systems can save lives during hazardous power outages. Adding solar panels to your home is subsidized by the NHC, QEC will credit you for all the power generated, potentially dropping your power bill to zero, and businesses can get tax credits to install panels. There’s no question about it, it’s time for Nunavut to go solar; we’ll be with you every step of the way. . Residential Grid-Tie Systems With QEC’s Net Metering Program
Nunavut home owners can take advantage of QEC’s residential net metering program to tie into the grid. This means if you’re producing more power then you’re using (typical in summer) you can feed power back to the grid and build up credits. These credits can then be used at a later point in time when you’re using more power than you’re producing (typical in winter).

Residential and commercial solar panels have been popular in southern areas for over a decade, but up until recently the technology wasn’t available to create solar panels that were efficient enough to produce a payoff in northern locations. Over the last 5 years however, solar panels have become more efficient and have decreased in price by over 80% making solar in Nunavut a viable and economical solution for residents.

Solar Power in Nunavut
Renewable energy and energy independence have become hot-button topics in our society. The need to create efficient energy production systems while mitigating harm to the environment is keenly felt throughout the world, and Nunavut is certainly no exception. Since 1947, the average temperature in Nunavut has increased by 2.7 degrees, and thawing permafrost has threatened infrastructure, building foundations, archaeological sites and land-based travel. The unique flora and fauna of the region are also threatened by changes to the climate.
The Quilliq Energy Corporation (QEC) is Nunavut’s sole supplier of energy; it operates 25 independent power grids for each of the territory’s communities. Nunavut is Canada’s largest region; it is, however, sparsely populated, so creating an interconnected territory-wide grid is not economically feasible. QEC relies almost entirely on diesel fuel imports to run it’s power generators; this is both costly and environmentally unsustainable. The independent grid system is also at risk, because when a power failure occurs it’s impossible to transfer power from another grid to sustain energy supply; QEC relies instead on emergency power generators when things go awry.
The price of importing the fuel to sustain these systems is extremely high, as Nunavummiut who have exceeded the subsidy limit and paid QEC unsubsidized rates know all too well. The WWF has estimated that an average of $60.5 million dollars worth of subsidy money is used each year to keep the cost of electricity reasonable. The costs of fossil fuel, both in terms of real dollars and in terms of environmental impact seem unfeasible, and reliance on QEC’s power generators can be problematic, so Nunavut must find a sustainable method of producing electricity reliably in it’s independent grids. The solution? Solar panels.
There was a point in time where solar panels would not have been practical in Nunavut; northern regions especially don’t get as much sunlight as older photovoltaic cells required to generate energy. New technologies have increased the capacity of these cells to convert solar power into usable electricity, and panels have recently been installed on Iqaluit’s power plant to prove the concept. QEC has also introduced a net metering program, which is one of two great incentives for Nunavummiut to install solar panels. The other incentive comes from the Nunavut Housing Corporation (NHC) in the form of a forgivable loan of up to $15,000 through the Home Renovation Program (HRP) for the costs of installing new energy efficient technologies.
Combining the net metering program with the HRP can generate tremendous savings for Nunavummiut. The net metering program allows you to transfer energy from your solar panels into the grid, and QEC will compensate you for every kilowatt-hour transferred by giving a credit on your account that can be used at a later date. The Government of Canada conducted a study on how much solar energy photovoltaic cells absorb per municipality; on average, a 5 kW solar system in Nunavut will produce 5579 kWh of electricity per year. The average consumption of electricity per capita in Nunavut is 5100 kWh, so a 5 kW system would in most cases offset your entire electrical bill for the year! After subsidy, power bills are often around 30 cents per kWh; that means savings of around 1530$/year; it can be substantially more if you’re paying unsubsidized rates! Note that in the winter months, you’ll get less solar energy, so the credits will be less substantial; that works out just fine, though. QEC allows you to roll over credits so when you create more electricity than you consume in a given month, you can use the extra credits in the following month. That means electricity you produce during the summer can be credited back during the winter, when your energy consumption will be higher!
There’s no doubt that using solar panels in Nunavut can cut your QEC bill down to zero, but the cost of installing them can be a bit intimidating. That’s where the NHC forgivable loan comes in; $15,000 will take a hefty chunk out of the cost of installing solar panels. There are a few conditions you want to be aware of; first, the subsidy comes in the form of a forgivable loan. Essentially, the loan does not have to be repaid if the conditions of the Loan Agreement are met. To be eligible, your home must be at least five years old. The full terms of the program can be found here.
QEC and NHC officials confirmed that the two subsidies can, in fact, be used in tandem to drastically offset the price of your energy. The NHC incentive only applies to residential installations. Businesses, conversely, can apply for a federal tax incentive, allowing them to deduct renewable expenses as capital costs at a rate of 100% in the first year, depending on the project, which coupled with the net metering program means drastic savings.
The increased use of solar energy in Nunavut will have drastic, lasting and positive implications for the territory and its citizens. Reducing reliance on imported fossil fuels will boost the territory’s independence, and help mitigate the effects of climate change. Citizens with solar panels and battery backup systems will be less reliant on grids that have central fault points; solar panels and battery backup systems can save lives during hazardous power outages. Adding solar panels to your home is subsidized by the NHC, QEC will credit you for all the power generated, potentially dropping your power bill to zero, and businesses can get tax credits to install panels. There’s no question about it, it’s time for Nunavut to go solar; we’ll be with you every step of the way. . ",False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False

worldwidetrophyadventures,https://worldwidetrophyadventures.com/trips/nunavut-territory-polar-bear-hunting/ ,"March 1 to May 31 is the date range that Spring Hunts occur. Exact starting dates are negotiable with Arctic air travel flight schedules taken into consideration, and are covered in each client’s hunting contract.
August 1 to the first week of November are their Late Summer – Early Fall Hunts
Note: If extra hunting days are needed, to a maximum of 5, they will be at the additional cost of $1,000 CAD per day payable directly to your guide.
This outfitter is the longest operating outfitting company in Nunavut offering the very finest in polar bear, Greenland and Barren-Ground Muskox, Central Canada Barren-Ground and Arctic Islands Caribou, Barren-Ground Grizzly and Atlantic Walrus hunts. Actually, this outfitter has pioneered polar bear hunts in the high arctic since 1981, and has maintained virtually 100% hunting success rate for the Resolute area.
Hunting is done from camps situated in prime areas that may be up to 100 miles from the village of Resolute. Muskox are found south of Resolute and can be hunted after a polar bear hunt as well. All of their hunts are normally 10 days long on a 1 on 1 guide ratio (one guide and dog team to every one hunter) or 2 on 2 guide ratio if you choose to do so. The hunt ends when a polar bear is harvested, even if this happens in the first day or two.
Canada’s Arctic is home to about 15,500 polar bears, consisting of two thirds of the world population. Canada is a proven world leader in the management, research, monitoring and conservation of polar bears and since 1975, the polar bear population has actually increased in Canada. Polar bears are long lived and wide ranging carnivores, with seals serving as their primary food source.
Canada’s management system is designed to respond to the full suite of threats to polar bears and their conservation, including climate change. A sustainable harvest is implemented through agreements and quotas, involving local people and governments have been in place in Canada since the 1970’s. Harvest quotas are based on the principles of conservation and aboriginal subsistence hunting, and are not market-driven whatsoever. The actual harvest level of polar bears is often less than established quotas.
Price upon request individual quotes. Polar Bear or Polar Bear/Walrus combination hunts are availalbe. Contact WTA for pricing and dates.
HARVEST LICENSE & TAG FEES:
The Government of Nunavut fees for a foreign non-resident harvest license and tags are as follows:
The government trophy fee is $750 to $1500 CAD plus applicable taxes. The export permit, currently free, is issued once the government trophy fee is paid.
Government fees are subject to change without notice
In the event that the outfitter cannot obtain a tag for the client to hunt polar bear, all monies paid for the polar bear hunt will be returned to the client in full. Another option would be to roll over the monies collected as a deposit towards a different year with price adjustments if applicable.
Note: There is a 50% refund on the 5% Federal Goods and Services Sales tax (GST) to foreign non-residents of Canada applicable only on the hunt cost
Hunting is carried out on the sea ice in prime areas that may be up to 160 kilometers from any one of the Inuit communities. Mobile tent camps are set up nightly after each day’s hunting activities.
Accommodations vary throughout the hunt. The following types of accommodations are used at different times.
Travel to Edmonton, Alberta and then to Cambridge Bay. From Cambridge Bay, all travel is taken care of by the outfitter.

Nunavut is the youngest territory in Canada. It is a region that was born out of a great hope for a new type of society – a society that differs substantially from the standard vision of a western urban one. It was created to both protect a traditional Indigenous lifestyle and culture that has existed for thousands of years and at the same time ensure the people of the region would have the necessary political tools to create a contemporary future according to their needs1. It hoped to provide its communities with the tools they needed to help them deal with the historical trauma they have been dealing with over the past 50 years and improve their well-being.
Nunavut as a region does not fit easily into the traditional discussion of rural-urban differences. It is composed of 25 communities that, range in size from 130 people to the capital, Iqaluit, with a population of 6,7002. Based on the definition of rural being communities of less than 1000, 75% of the population of Nunavut can be categorized as being urban. Yet, as many studies have shown, the existence of all communities in Nunavut are still heavily dependent economically and culturally on harvesting the benefits of the land and as such can be seen as rural.
From one perspective, these communities have been in existence for a relatively short period of time. Most communities date from the late 1950s to the 1960s. Yet from another perspective they have been in existence for thousands of years – albeit not in fixed locations. The population of the territory is primarily Inuit. Over 85% of the 31,900 people that live in the territory are part of a culture that until the late 1950s and 1960s lived in small mobile groupings which based their existence primarily on hunting and gathering3. While the policy of the federal government had been to keep the Inuit of northern Canada “on the land” so as to ensure the protection of their lifestyle, a number of events occurred in the 1950s and 1960s which caused the federal government to reverse this strategy and create a series of central communities where many of the health and education services that other Canadians took for granted, could be provided.
The radical nature of this change, and the structures that were created to manage the change, have created what many are now referring to as a “historical trauma” for these communities. This trauma has resulted in a range of social, cultural, and health issues that represent enormous challenges for the communities of Nunavut. While the creation of Nunavut was seen as a first step in helping these communities deal with these challenges, the first 16 years of existence of Nunavut have shown that, while some improvements are starting to be realized, many obstacles remain.
Demographics and Human Capital Development
Nunavut as a territory has seen strong demographic growth over the past 20 years4. Overall the population has increased from 20,900 in 1991 to 31,900 in 2011, an increase of 52%. Since their creation in the late 1950s and 1960s, the 25 communities of Nunavut have generally all seen increases in their population although there is a great deal of variation in these increases2. The greatest single loss of population in a community occurred when the primarily non-indigenous mining community of Nanisivik, created in 1975, closed down about in 2002. Since the closure of Nanisivik, all communities in Nunavut have a majority Indigenous population with only Iqaluit having a non-indigenous population larger than 25% (42%)5.
Almost all population growth is due to a natural increase of the Indigenous population. Both in-migration and out-migration is limited primarily to non-indigenous migrants working in the public sector6. One result of the importance of natural increase is the fact that the population of communities in Nunavut tend to have a high percentage of youth. In 2006 34% of all people living in these communities were between 0 and 14 years of age compared to a national average of 17.7%4 There are also relatively few elderly. Only 2.8% of the population of Nunavut were 65 years of age or older in 2006 compared to a national average of 13.7%.
Demographically speaking Nunavut communities can be portrayed as being young and growing. Migration is limited as the Indigenous population of the region display a strong attachment to their home communities. This attachment is perhaps surprising given the many challenges facing these communities. One of the most important is that of education and human capital development. There have been a number of studies highlighting the problems in these communities surrounding education7,8,9,10. Improving education is now, and has long been, a concern of people living in the communities of Nunavut. Indeed this concern was one of the reasons for centralization into villages in the 1960s3. Yet education continues to be a challenge. While only 15% of the Canadian population between the ages of 25 and 64 in 2006 had less than a high school diploma, this figure was 46% in Nunavut11. Low high school graduation rates have long been an issue in Nunavut and recent statistics indicate that the problem may not be improving12.
Governance
The creation of Nunavut has enabled a situation where there is a greater ability of the people of Nunavut to govern themselves. While the territorial government does not yet control some key areas such as natural resource development, they do have considerable powers in other areas13. Despite this situation there are still challenges being faced by Nunavut communities in terms of governance. Capacity is an issue in the region14. While opportunities exist, the region often does not have the capacity to take advantage of these opportunities. Nunavut has been unable to fill many of its government jobs with Inuit from Nunavut. It is forced to look outside the region for people to fill these jobs and often the jobs go unfilled for long periods of time.
The territory is in a unique situation of governance in that while the Government of Nunavut has the responsibilities for the delivery of many services, it is the land claim organization, Nunavut Tunngavik, along with its regional bodies, that control many aspects of economic and social development in the region15. Discussions regarding benefits from resource development often take place between land claim organizations and companies with limited involvement of the territorial government.
Economy
All the communities of Nunavut are based on a “mixed” economy16. The traditional subsistence economy has been that which they have relied upon for their survival for thousands of years while the wage economy is relatively recent. In addition, transfers from government and other sources represent an important aspect of the economy. Hunting and gathering activities continue to play an important part of these communities not only from an economic perspective but also from a cultural and social perspective even though official figures show that these activities represent a small, but constant part of gross domestic product in Nunavut17. Commercialization around these activities has been possible in some communities18, however, pressure from animal rights activists have had a negative impact on attempts to re-invigorate this sector of the economy.
Public sector expenditures represent the most important sector of the economy with 32% of Nunavut’s gross domestic product coming from education, health, and public administration expenditures17. Mining is now the next most important sector of the economy following the opening of the Meadowbank Gold Mine in 2010 and the Baffinlands Iron Mine in 2014. Mining continues to be seen as one of the most important sectors for growth in the region. Mining represented 18% of GDP in 2014. Construction, some of it related to mining, represented 16% of GDP.
Arts and crafts production has been, and continues to be, an important part of the economy in several communities especially that of Cape Dorset19. New activities that communities are hoping to develop in the region include commercial fishing and tourism20. It is interesting to note that communities in Nunavut have expressly attempted to develop a “social economy” based on traditional values of cooperation and community well-being rather than competition and profit-maximization21.
Challenges
Despite the growth of these communities and the relative absence of out-migration, the communities themselves face a number of important challenges. Many of them are the result of the rapid change introduced over the past 50 years. More recently many of these challenges are being seen as at least partially the result of historical trauma22,23,24. Social issues such as high suicide rates, alcohol and drug abuse, homicide and assault, and family violence are often present in these communities.
Food security is an important issue in Nunavut communities25,26,27. Challenges to the traditional economy often limit access to traditional foods. Food costs are often extremely high in the region which makes it difficult for those with little money. Much attention has been devoted to climate change and while it has yet to create challenges in most communities it may represent a future challenge to food security and health28,29.
Infrastructure and housing are both important challenges facing communities in Nunavut. The costs of maintaining the normal types of services in these communities that other communities in Canada enjoy are quite high. Energy is an on-going issue with most communities dependent upon costly and unreliable diesel generators. The delivery of water and the collection of waste are dependent on trucks that often breakdown creating sanitation problems. Waste disposal is often a problem and resulted in an uncontrolled fire at the dump facilities in Iqualuit in 2014. Housing is often among the worst in Canada in terms of availability and quality and homelessness is increasing in importance30.
While many of these challenges are linked to a difficult past, the most important factor in resolving many of these issues is ensuring a sustainable economic future for these communities. Unemployment is high and many are concerned that there will be few jobs in the future for their children. Mining represents a potential source of employment but many are concerned about both the impact of resource development on the environment and on their communities. There is a strong desire to develop a sustainable future based on the utilization of renewable resources but there is also a realization that extractive resource development may be necessary in order to provide the benefits to make this happen.
