#1 Environmental Firm . Cities are looking for ways to prepare for the increasing number of physical, social and economic challenges that threaten their growth and development. 100RC — Pioneered by the Rockefeller Foundation — is dedicated to helping cities around the world respond to these challenges, and AECOM is providing the strategic planning services to make it happen.
The Challenge
As a strategic advisor, thought partner and project manager for the cities participating in 100RC, AECOM helps facilitate diverse stakeholder engagement workshops to better understand perceptions, needs and risks. We carry out technical analyses in key priority areas, help to identify a list of potential actions and assist in developing the final strategy.
Solutions and Involvement
The 100RC resilience method identifies interdependencies between major components of a city: people and organizations, places and infrastructure, and the economy, networks and knowledge. This harnesses connections to help cities cope and recover after sudden events like fires, earthquakes and floods, referred to as “shocks” by 100RC, which make cities vulnerable. The method also addresses long-term trends, referred to as “stresses,” such as unemployment and widespread crime that undermine cities’ systems and increase their vulnerability.
Achievements and Outcomes
In 2016, AECOM helped Bangkok (Thailand), Berkeley (United States), Christchurch (New Zealand), Medellín (Colombia), Melbourne (Australia), Mexico City (Mexico), Oakland (United States), Rotterdam (Netherlands) and San Francisco (United States) publish their resilience strategies. We also worked with Wellington (New Zealand) to publish its resilience strategy in March 2017. We will help at least an additional seven cities publish their strategies in 2017.
Our Work and the SDGs
The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have been adopted by countries to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure prosperity for all. AECOM supports the SDGs. You can read AECOM’s Sustainability Report 2016 to learn more about how our work on clients’ projects, like this one, is helping transform the world. .

ducksters,https://www.ducksters.com/science/environment/ ,"The environment is everything around us. All our surroundings including the air, soil, water, plants, and animals make up the environment.
EarthSource: NASA
Biomes and Ecosystems
Plants and animals need a healthy environment to survive. An ecosystem is an area where living organisms interact in a specific way with the local environment to survive. When ecosystems are damaged by man, then some living organisms may not be able to survive. A biome is a large group of similar ecosystems like the desert, savanna, and rainforest.
Environmental science studies the environment and how the earth works. Environmental scientists often study how humans have impacted the Earth's environment and how we can reduce the impact that humans have on the environment.
Environmental scientists study things like the atmosphere, the oceans, geology, habitats, and ecology.
Nutrient Cycles
The Earth's environment is constantly recycling nutrients so they can be used by different parts of the environment. These cycles are important for the existence of living organisms. Some important cycles include the water cycle, the nitrogen cycle, the carbon cycle, the oxygen cycle, and the food chain.
Human activities have created many environmental issues from land, water, and air pollution. Part of environmental science is to determine how the environment has been impacted and then to work on ways to help the environment recover.
One important aspect of helping the environment to recover is renewable energy. Renewable energy uses energy sources that cannot be ""used up."" Rather than burning fossil fuels like coal and oil, renewable energy uses energy sources like the wind and the Sun. . ",False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False
worldbank,https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/environment/overview ,"Context
The sustainable management of the environment and natural resources is vital for economic growth and human wellbeing. When managed well, renewable natural resources, watersheds, productive landscapes and seascapes can provide the foundation for sustained inclusive growth, food security and poverty reduction. Natural resources provide livelihoods for hundreds of millions of people and generate sizeable tax revenue. The world’s ecosystems regulate the air, water and soil on which we all depend, and form a unique and cost-effective buffer against extreme weather events and climate change.
Healthy ecosystems are essential for the long-term growth of economic sectors such as agriculture, forestry, fisheries and tourism. They provide hundreds of millions of jobs. One third of the world’s 100 largest cities draw their water supply from protected areas. Three quarters of the world’s top 115 food crops depend on animal pollination. In developing countries, forests, lakes, rivers and oceans provide a significant share of households’ diets, fuel and incomes and represent a precious safety net in times of crisis, particularly for the poor who live in rural areas.
The integrity and functionality of these vital natural assets, however, are increasingly compromised, with 60 to 70% of the world’s ecosystems degrading faster than they can recover. Mismanagement of the environment and natural resources results in significant economic losses: for instance, an estimated $80 billion are squandered each year due to ocean fisheries mismanagement. Air pollution is now the fourth leading risk factor for premature death, contributing to 1 in 10 of all deaths worldwide and resulting in significant losses of welfare and income. Nature is under threat and one million animal and plant species, out of a total estimate of 8 million, risk extinction, many within decades, according to the latest report by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES).
The coronavirus pandemic underscores the links between human health and nature, with research showing that deforestation and land use change, habitat fragmentation, encroachment, rapid population growth and urbanization multiply the chances of contagion from diseases such as COVID-19 and other pathogens.
While nature can act as a buffer between humans and pathogens, it can also help in economic and social recovery efforts. In the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, governments and the development community will need to rapidly deploy stimulus packages at scale to spur economic recovery. There is an opportunity to design these packages in a way that integrates longer-term sustainability considerations, including solutions that boost the economy and simultaneously deliver positive environmental outcomes. Some examples include reduction of carbon emissions, conservation of biodiversity, and protection of ecosystem services that underpin a country’s prosperity and resilience to shocks like pandemics

Worldwide consumption and production — a driving force of the global economy — rest on the use of the natural environment and resources in a way that continues to have destructive impacts on the planet.
Economic and social progress over the last century has been accompanied by environmental degradation that is endangering the very systems on which our future development — indeed, our very survival — depends.
A few facts and figures:
- Each year, an estimated one third of all food produced – equivalent to 1.3 billion tonnes worth around $1 trillion – ends up rotting in the bins of consumers and retailers, or spoiling due to poor transportation and harvesting practices.
- If people worldwide switched to energy efficient light bulbs the world would save US$120 billion annually.
- Should the global population reach 9.6 billion by 2050, the equivalent of almost three planets could be required to provide the natural resources needed to sustain current lifestyles.
The COVID-19 pandemic offers countries an opportunity to build recovery plans that will reverse current trends and change our consumption and production patterns towards a more sustainable future.
Sustainable consumption and production is about doing more and better with less. It is also about decoupling economic growth from environmental degradation, increasing resource efficiency and promoting sustainable lifestyles.
Sustainable consumption and production can also contribute substantially to poverty alleviation and the transition towards low-carbon and green economies.
COVID-19 response
The current crisis is an opportunity for a profound, systemic shift to a more sustainable economy that works for both people and the planet.
The emergence of COVID-19 has underscored the relationship between people and nature and revealed the fundamental tenets of the trade-off we consistently face: humans have unlimited needs, but the planet has limited capacity to satisfy them. We must try to understand and appreciate the limits to which humans can push nature, before the impact is negative. Those limits must be reflected in our consumption and production patterns.
COVID-19 can be a catalyst for social change. We must build back better and transition our production and consumption patterns towards more sustainable practices.
- According to latest projections, the global population could grow to around 8.5 billion in 2030, 9.7 billion in 2050. The equivalent of almost three planets could be required to provide the natural resources needed to sustain current lifestyles.
- 93 per cent of the world’s 250 largest companies are now reporting on sustainability.
Water
- Less than 3 per cent of the world’s water is fresh (drinkable), of which 2.5 per cent is frozen in the Antarctica, Arctic and glaciers. Humanity must therefore rely on 0.5 per cent for all of man’s ecosystem’s and freshwater needs.
- Humankind is polluting water in rivers and lakes faster than nature can recycle and purify
- More than 1 billion people still do not have access to fresh water.
- Excessive use of water contributes to the global water stress.
- Water is free from nature, but the infrastructure needed to deliver it is expensive.
- Water use has been increasing worldwide by about 1per cent per year since the 1980s.
- Agriculture (including irrigation, livestock and aquaculture) is by far the largest water consumer, accounting for 69per cent of annual water withdrawals globally. Industry (including power generation) accounts for 19per cent and households for 12per cent.
- Over 2 billion people live in countries experiencing high water stress.
- Over the period 1995–2015, floods accounted for 43per cent of all documented natural disasters, affecting 2.3 billion people, killing 157,000 more and causing US$662 billion in damage.
- Three out of ten people (2.1 billion people, or 29per cent of the global population) did not use a safely managed drinking water service4 in 2015, whereas 844 million people still lacked even a basic drinking water service.
Energy
- If people worldwide switched to energy efficient lightbulbs, the world would save US$120 billion annually.
- Despite technological advances that have promoted energy efficiency gains, energy use in OECD countries will continue to grow another 35 per cent by 2020. Commercial and residential energy use is the second most rapidly growing area of global energy use after transport.
- In 2002 the motor vehicle stock in OECD countries was 550 million vehicles (75 per cent of which were personal cars). A 32 per cent increase in vehicle ownership is expected by 2020. At the same time, motor vehicle kilometers are projected to increase by 40 per cent and global air travel is projected to triple in the same period.
- Households consume 29 per cent of global energy and consequently contribute to 21 per cent of resultant CO2 emissions.
- The share of renewable energy in final energy consumption has reached 17.5per cent in 2015.
- The global electrification rate reached 89per cent in 2017 (from 83per cent in 2010), still leaving about 840 million people without access
- Between 2010 and 2017, the percentage of the population relying on clean cooking solutions grew by an annual average of 0.5 percentage points.
- The global population without access to electricity fell from 1.2 billion in 2010 to 840 million in 2017.
Food
- Each year, an estimated 1/3 of all food produced – equivalent to 1.3 billion tons worth around $1 trillion – ends up rotting in the bins of consumers and retailers, or spoiling due to poor transportation and harvesting practices
- 38 million children under the age of 5 were overweight or obese in 2019.
- Land degradation, declining soil fertility, unsustainable water use, overfishing and marine environment degradation are all lessening the ability of the natural resource base to supply food.
- The food sector accounts for around 30 per cent of the world’s total energy consumption and accounts for around 22 per cent of total Greenhouse Gas emissions.

au,https://phd.tech.au.dk/programmes/environmental-science/ ,"Environmental science provides an integrated interdisciplinary approach to research in the functioning and management of complex environmental systems that requires the involvement of both quantitative and qualitative science domains. Environmental Science research takes departure in both natural and social science disciplines, and includes both disciplinary and interdisciplinary approaches. Environmental Science has a particular emphasis on tackling the major challenges that face society like pollution and pollution control mechanisms, management of soil, water, air and biodiversity, protection of ecosystem service delivery, climate change, and energy systems. These challenges are creating a growing need for scientists with rigorous interdisciplinary scientific training and Environmental Science offers a curriculum that is designed to prepare students for future leadership within this discipline. As already stated environmental science is highly interdisciplinary and ranges from physics, chemistry, microbiology, geography, mathematics, and computer science, to social science, economics and policy. Central in environmental science studies are anthropogenic but also natural emissions to the environment starting a complex chain of processes involving transport, chemical and physical transformations and impact of the directly emitted species or their products on climate, nature, well-being and health. The studies related to social science includes investigations of what controls our decisions and behaviour and how these affects environmental pressures. Another branch of studies concern improving our understanding of governing physical, chemical and biological processes controlling the fate of pollutants emitted to the environment. Studies include development of new analytical methods, application of state-of-the-art analytical instruments to for carrying out field investigations as well as development and application of mathematical models in the aim of improving our understanding of governing processes in the environment, but also in evaluating the efficiencies of various abatement strategies and policy tools in environmental management.
Examples of areas of research are:
Environmental Science hosts several environmental analytical laboratories providing state-of-the-art facilities for measurements in all environmental media and matrices. Such measurements include routine analysis of simple parameters, accredited analysis within (inter)national monitoring programs and high end measurements of pollutants at trace levels with e.g. GC-MS, LC-MS and GC-HRMS. The microbiology laboratories provide additional facilities for the environmental research of microorganisms, pollutants and their interactions. Environmental Sciences has a large expertise in long-term monitoring and intensive campaigns and studies of long time series of chemical and physical parameters in the atmosphere relevant for describing the fate of pollutants, particles and green house gases. Computer facilities include access to power full computer resources both in-house and at the University for developing and applying mathematical models. Environmental Science has access to modern GIS environment for geographical analysis of emission and land use data, generation of various input data for mathematical models etc.
Environmental Science is national focal point for the Danish EPA and the European Environment Agency (EEA) on atmospheric emissions of green house gases and air pollutants under a contract under the Danish National Centre for Environment and Energy. Environmental Science is national focal point for the Danish EPA and the European Environment Agency (EEA) on air quality in Denmark and maintains, operate and report in this context the monitoring results obtained within the NOVANA (det Nye Overvågningsprogram for Vandmiljø og Natur) programme on air pollution loads and levels in relation to the EU air quality guidelines, as well as within the AMAP (Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme) programme on pollutant loads to Greenland. Environmental Science is partner of the Nordic Centre of Excellence in climate adaption research NORDSTAR, and of the network ECOGLOBE which is a network for interdisciplinary phd studies in climate change, land use changes etc.
Students from Environmental Science obtain skills and knowledge which is crucial in Environmental Management in municipalities, Agencies under the Ministry of Environment, European Environment Agency, EU etc, but also provide the perfect basis for working in Environmental Consultancy or other parts of the private sector (e.g. biotech companies). Other students continue in Environmental Research at AU or at other universities in Denmark or abroad.
The Environmental Science is currently located at Frederiksborgvej 399, 4000 Roskilde at the Risø Campus. The department operates the Danish Air Quality Monitoring Programme under NOVANA. In this context the employees at the department perform routine measurements at monitoring sites in both rural and urban areas. The latter includes measurements at street and urban background stations in the four largest cities in the country (Copenhagen, Aarhus, Odense and Aalborg). In addition the department operates Air Quality Monitoring in the Arctic, which includes performing measurements at station North in Greenland.
The Environmental Science has a close cooperation with researchers at most of the other Danish universities and in addition a number of other research organisations and institutes. An example is the cooperation with Danish physicians in environmental and occupational medicine on assessing health effects of environmental exposures. Another example is the cooperation with Danish Environmental Economic Council on valuation of impact of environmental pressures.
The Environmental Science takes part in a variety of international societies and networks: COST actions, ACCENT research network, PEER (Partnership for European Environmental Research) cooperation (the PEER partnership include seven major environmental research institutes in Europe) network, Landscape Europe, Arctic Centre of Research and Arctic Science partnership, International Union for Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC), European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme (EMEP), European Geophysical Union (EGU).

The world's plastic pollution crisis explained
Much of the planet is swimming in discarded plastic, which is harming animal and possibly human health. Can it be cleaned up?
Plastic pollution has become one of the most pressing environmental issues, as rapidly increasing production of disposable plastic products overwhelms the world’s ability to deal with them. Plastic pollution is most visible in developing Asian and African nations, where garbage collection systems are often inefficient or nonexistent. But the developed world, especially in countries with low recycling rates, also has trouble properly collecting discarded plastics. Plastic trash has become so ubiquitous it has prompted efforts to write a global treaty negotiated by the United Nations.
How did this happen?
Plastics made from fossil fuels are just over a century old. Production and development of thousands of new plastic products accelerated after World War II, so transforming the modern age that life without plastics would be unrecognizable today. Plastics revolutionized medicine with life-saving devices, made space travel possible, lightened cars and jets—saving fuel and pollution—and saved lives with helmets, incubators, and equipment for clean drinking water.
The conveniences plastics offer, however, led to a throw-away culture that reveals the material’s dark side: today, single-use plastics account for 40 percent of the plastic produced every year. Many of these products, such as plastic bags and food wrappers, have a lifespan of mere minutes to hours, yet they may persist in the environment for hundreds of years.
Plastics by the numbers
Some key facts:
- Half of all plastics ever manufactured have been made in the last 15 years.
- Production increased exponentially, from 2.3 million tons in 1950 to 448 million tons by 2015. Production is expected to double by 2050.
- Every year, about 8 million tons of plastic waste escapes into the oceans from coastal nations. That’s the equivalent of setting five garbage bags full of trash on every foot of coastline around the world.
- Plastics often contain additives making them stronger, more flexible, and durable. But many of these additives can extend the life of products if they become litter, with some estimates ranging to at least 400 years to break down.
How plastics move around the world
Most of the plastic trash in the oceans, Earth’s last sink, flows from land. Trash is also carried to sea by major rivers, which act as conveyor belts, picking up more and more trash as they move downstream. Once at sea, much of the plastic trash remains in coastal waters. But once caught up in ocean currents, it can be transported around the world.
On Henderson Island, an uninhabited atoll in the Pitcairn Group isolated halfway between Chile and New Zealand, scientists found plastic items from Russia, the United States, Europe, South America, Japan, and China. They were carried to the South Pacific by the South Pacific gyre, a circular ocean current.
Microplastics
Once at sea, sunlight, wind, and wave action break down plastic waste into small particles, often less than one-fifth of an inch across. These so-called microplastics are spread throughout the water column and have been found in every corner of the globe, from Mount Everest, the highest peak, to the Mariana Trench, the deepest trough.
Microplastics are breaking down further into smaller and smaller pieces. Plastic microfibers, meanwhile, have been found in municipal drinking water systems and drifting through the air.
Harm to wildlife
Millions of animals are killed by plastics every year, from birds to fish to other marine organisms. Nearly 700 species, including endangered ones, are known to have been affected by plastics. Nearly every species of seabird eats plastics.
Most of the deaths to animals are caused by entanglement or starvation. Seals, whales, turtles, and other animals are strangled by abandoned fishing gear or discarded six-pack rings. Microplastics have been found in more than 100 aquatic species, including fish, shrimp, and mussels destined for our dinner plates. In many cases, these tiny bits pass through the digestive system and are expelled without consequence. But plastics have also been found to have blocked digestive tracts or pierced organs, causing death. Stomachs so packed with plastics reduce the urge to eat, causing starvation.
Plastics have been consumed by land-based animals, including elephants, hyenas, zebras, tigers, camels, cattle, and other large mammals, in some cases causing death.
Tests have also confirmed liver and cell damage and disruptions to reproductive systems, prompting some species, such as oysters, to produce fewer eggs. New research shows that larval fish are eating nanofibers in the first days of life, raising new questions about the effects of plastics on fish populations.
Stemming the plastic tide
Once in the ocean, it is difficult—if not impossible—to retrieve plastic waste. Mechanical systems, such as Mr. Trash Wheel, a litter interceptor in Maryland’s Baltimore Harbor, can be effective at picking up large pieces of plastic, such as foam cups and food containers, from inland waters. But once plastics break down into microplastics and drift throughout the water column in the open ocean, they are virtually impossible to recover.
The solution is to prevent plastic waste from entering rivers and seas in the first place, many scientists and conservationists—including the National Geographic Society—say. This could be accomplished with improved waste management systems and recycling, better product design that takes into account the short life of disposable packaging, and reduction in manufacturing of unnecessary single-use plastics. .

Trade and environment
Sustainable development and protection and preservation of the environment are fundamental goals of the WTO. They are enshrined in the Marrakesh Agreement, which established the WTO, and complement the WTO’s objective to reduce trade barriers and eliminate discriminatory treatment in international trade relations. While there is no specific agreement dealing with the environment, under WTO rules members can adopt trade-related measures aimed at protecting the environment provided a number of conditions to avoid the misuse of such measures for protectionist ends are fulfilled.
The WTO contributes to the protection and preservation of the environment through its objective of ensuring sustainable development and avoiding protectionism, through its rules and enforcement mechanism, and through work in different WTO bodies.

Trade and environment in the WTO
Introduction
Through its goals, rules, institutions and forward-looking agenda, the WTO provides an important means of advancing international environmental goals.
History
Trade and environment, as an issue, is by no means new. The link between trade and environmental protection — both the impact of environmental policies on trade, and the impact of trade on the environment — was recognized as early as 1970. Towards the end of the Uruguay Round (1986–1994), attention was once again drawn to trade-related environmental issues, and the role of the soon-to-be-created World Trade Organization.
Tenth Ministerial Conference: Briefing notes
Work in the WTO
Regular Trade and Environment Committee
The Trade and Environment Committee is the standing forum dedicated to dialogue between governments on the impact of trade policies on the environment, and of environment policies on trade. Created in 1995, the Committee has followed a comprehensive work programme.
Under the Doha Development Agenda, the regular committee is also looking at the effects of environmental measures on market access, the intellectual property agreement and biodiversity, and labelling for environmental purposes.
-
Environmental Goods Agreement
In the Doha Round, WTO members received a mandate to negotiate certain aspects of the link between trade and the environment, particularly the relationship between the WTO’s agreements and those of other agencies, and market access for environmental goods and services. These talks take place in “Special Sessions” of the Trade and Environment Committee.
Separately, eighteen participants representing 46 WTO members are negotiating an Environmental Goods Agreement
WTO rules and environmental policies back to top
Measures aimed at protecting the environment come in various shapes and forms. Under WTO rules, as confirmed by WTO jurisprudence, members can adopt trade-related measures aimed at protecting the environment, subject to certain specified conditions.
- Introduction
- Key GATT disciplines
- GATT exceptions
- Other relevant WTO texts
- Environment-related disputes
Trade and environment topical issues
Trade and Climate Change
The issue of climate change, per se, is not part of the WTO's ongoing work programme and there are no WTO rules specific to climate change. However, the WTO is relevant because climate change measures and policies intersect with international trade in a number of different ways.
- Trade and green economy
The WTO offers a powerful supporting framework for sustainable development and green economy. It provides an enabling environment through its objectives, institutions and monitoring of potential trade protectionism, enforcement mechanism, toolbox of rules, and growing case law in the environment area.
- Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a set of 17 goals and 169 targets that members of the United Nations have endorsed as part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
- Co-operation with Multilateral Environmental Agreements
The WTO Secretariat cooperates with a number of implementing bodies for Multilateral Environmental Agreements (MEAs), following their work and providing information on WTO rules and mechanisms. The CTE also regularly receives trade-relevant information and updates from MEAs.
- MEAs Matrix
- CITES Publication
- WTO E-Learning
Technical assistance
WTO technical assistance on trade and the environment aims to help developing countries participate more effectively in the work of the Trade and Environment Committee and in the negotiations.

A large and growing number of manufacturers are realizing substantial financial and environmental benefits from sustainable business practices. Sustainable manufacturing is the creation of manufactured products through economically-sound processes that minimize negative environmental impacts while conserving energy and natural resources. Sustainable manufacturing also enhances employee, community and product safety.
The Business Case for Sustainable Manufacturing
A growing number of companies are treating ""sustainability"" as an important objective in their strategy and operations to increase growth and global competitiveness. This trend has reached well beyond the small niche of those who traditionally positioned themselves as ""green,"" and now includes many prominent businesses across many different industry sectors. In many cases, these efforts are having significant results.
There are a number of reasons why companies are pursuing sustainability:
- Increase operational efficiency by reducing costs and waste
- Respond to or reach new customers and increase competitive advantage
- Protect and strengthen brand and reputation and build public trust
- Build long-term business viability and success
- Respond to regulatory constraints and opportunities
Companies engaged in sustainability efforts include those of all sizes, ages and sectors. Companies move forward along the path to sustainability by improving performance and reducing their resource footprint. Ways that companies progress further on the path to sustainability include:
- Address sustainability in a coordinated, integrated and formal manner, rather than in an ad hoc, unconnected and informal manner
- Focus on increased competitiveness and revenues rather than primarily focusing on cost-cutting, risk reduction and improved efficiency
- Use innovation, scenario planning and strategic analysis to go beyond compliance
- Integrate sustainability across business functions
- Focus more on the long term
- Work collaboratively with external stakeholders

pachamama,https://www.pachamama.org/environmental-awareness ,"Environmental awareness is to understand the fragility of our environment and the importance of its protection. Promoting environmental awareness is an easy way to become an environmental steward and participate in creating a brighter future for our children.
To define environmental awareness we must first understand the environmentalist movement. Environmentalism is an ideology that evokes the necessity and responsibility of humans to respect, protect, and preserve the natural world from its anthropogenic (caused by humans) afflictions.
Environmental awareness is an integral part of the movement’s success. By teaching our friends and family that the physical environment is fragile and indispensable, we can begin fixing the problems that threaten it.
Before you can begin promoting environmental awareness in your community, you must first make sure that you have a thorough understanding of environmental issues. Stay up to date on environmental news, read books and other resources, and learn about the issues affecting your own community. It’s much easier to talk to others about the environment if you’ve already taken the time to educate yourself.
Numerous resources are available to promote environmental awareness and education: group learning (inside or outside of the classroom), informational and inspirational seminars, online courses, books, articles, videos, and brochures are just a few of the tools that can get you involved in promoting the environment.
A good course of action that ensures your continued participation is to pick an environmental issue that strikes you as the most urgent. The amount of environmental issues seems limitless, and while they are all important, it’s easy to get overwhelmed. Try choosing one issue to focus on at a time. You will soon see that all environmental issues are intertwined and will find your niche of interest.
Here are several cause-and-effect problems that harm our environment:
After you’ve chosen an issue and educated yourself, engage your community, family, and friends in a conversation about the issue’s urgency and importance.
By engaging your community in the conversation, you are not only promoting environmental awareness, but you may also find opportunities to participate in communal projects or to get involved in other related causes.
Once you’re well versed in environmental issues, you can use that knowledge to start beneficial projects in your home and/or in your community.
Once you have chosen your cause and have started a personal or community project, share it with the world! Get your coworkers, neighbors, friends, family, or even your local government involved. It’s much easier and more effective to spread environmental awareness and start a local project if you collaborate with others in your community.
Promoting environmental awareness is a crucial part of being an environmental steward. Start participating in the change and teach your community what is needed to create a sustainable future. . ",False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False

ucsusa,https://www.ucsusa.org/resources/environmental-impacts-renewable-energy-technologies https://www.ucsusa.org/resources/environmental-impacts-natural-gas ,"All energy sources have some impact on our environment. Fossil fuels—coal, oil, and natural gas—do substantially more harm than renewable energy sources by most measures, including air and water pollution, damage to public health, wildlife and habitat loss, water use, land use, and global warming emissions.
However, renewable sources such as wind, solar, geothermal, biomass, and hydropower also have environmental impacts, some of which are significant.
The exact type and intensity of environmental impacts varies depending on the specific technology used, the geographic location, and a number of other factors. By understanding the current and potential environmental issues associated with each renewable energy source, we can takes steps to effectively avoid or minimize these impacts as they become a larger portion of our electric supply.
Wind power
Harnessing power from the wind is one of the cleanest and most sustainable ways to generate electricity as it produces no toxic pollution or global warming emissions. Wind is also abundant, inexhaustible, and affordable, which makes it a viable and large-scale alternative to fossil fuels.
Despite its vast potential, there are a variety of environmental impacts associated with wind power generation that should be recognized and mitigated. They include land use issues and challenges to wildlife and habitat.
Solar power
Like wind power, the sun provides a tremendous resource for generating clean and sustainable electricity.
The environmental impacts associated with solar power can include land use and habitat loss, water use, and the use of hazardous materials in manufacturing, though the types of impacts vary greatly depending on the scale of the system and the technology used—photovoltaic (PV) solar cells or concentrating solar thermal plants (CSP).
Geothermal energy
The most widely developed type of geothermal power plant (known as hydrothermal plants) are located near geologic “hot spots” where hot molten rock is close to the earth’s crust and produces hot water.
In other regions enhanced geothermal systems (or hot dry rock geothermal), which involve drilling into the earth’s surface to reach deeper geothermal resources, can allow broader access to geothermal energy.
Geothermal plants also differ in terms of the technology they use to convert the resource to electricity (direct steam, flash, or binary) and the type of cooling technology they use (water-cooled and air-cooled). Environmental impacts differ depending on the conversion and cooling technology used.
Biomass for electricity
Biomass power plants share some similarities with fossil fuel power plants: both involve the combustion of a feedstock to generate electricity. Thus, biomass plants raise similar, but not identical, concerns about air emissions and water use as fossil fuel plants. However, the feedstock of biomass plants can be sustainable produced, while fossil fuels are non-renewable.
Sources of biomass resources for producing electricity are diverse, ranging from energy crops (like switchgrass), to agricultural waste, manure, forest products and waste, and urban waste. Both the type of feedstock and the manner in which it is developed and harvested significantly affect land use and life-cycle global warming emissions impacts of producing power from biomass.
Hydroelectric power
Hydroelectric power includes both massive hydroelectric dams and small run-of-the-river plants. Large-scale hydroelectric dams continue to be built in many parts of the world (including China and Brazil), but it is unlikely that new facilities will be added to the existing US fleet in the future.
Instead, the future of hydroelectric power in the United States will likely involve increased capacity at current dams and new run-of-the-river projects. There are environmental impacts at both types of plants.
Hydrokinetic energy
Hydrokinetic energy, which includes wave and tidal power, encompasses an array of energy technologies, many of which still in the experimental stages or in the early stages of deployment. While actual impacts of large-scale operations have not been observed, a range of potential impacts can be projected.
Despite these environmental impacts, renewable energy technologies compare extremely favorably to fossil fuels, and remain a core part of the solution to climate change. . Global warming emissions
Natural gas is a fossil fuel, though the global warming emissions from its combustion are much lower than those from coal or oil.
Natural gas emits 50 to 60 percent less carbon dioxide (CO2) when combusted in a new, efficient natural gas power plant compared with emissions from a typical new coal plant [1]. Considering only tailpipe emissions, natural gas also emits 15 to 20 percent less heat-trapping gases than gasoline when burned in today’s typical vehicle [2].
Emissions from smokestacks and tailpipes, however, do not tell the full story.
The drilling and extraction of natural gas from wells and its transportation in pipelines results in the leakage of methane, primary component of natural gas that is 34 times stronger than CO2 at trapping heat over a 100-year period and 86 times stronger over 20 years [3]. Preliminary studies and field measurements show that these so-called “fugitive” methane emissions range from 1 to 9 percent of total life cycle emissions [4].
Whether natural gas has lower life cycle greenhouse gas emissions than coal and oil depends on the assumed leakage rate, the global warming potential of methane over different time frames, the energy conversion efficiency, and other factors [5]. One recent study found that methane losses must be kept below 3.2 percent for natural gas power plants to have lower life cycle emissions than new coal plants over short time frames of 20 years or fewer [6]. And if burning natural gas in vehicles is to deliver even marginal benefits, methane losses must be kept below 1 percent and 1.6 percent compared with diesel fuel and gasoline, respectively. Technologies are available to reduce much of the leaking methane, but deploying such technology would require new policies and investments [7].

Air pollution
Cleaner burning than other fossil fuels, the combustion of natural gas produces negligible amounts of sulfur, mercury, and particulates. Burning natural gas does produce nitrogen oxides (NOx), which are precursors to smog, but at lower levels than gasoline and diesel used for motor vehicles. DOE analyses indicate that every 10,000 U.S. homes powered with natural gas instead of coal avoids the annual emissions of 1,900 tons of NOx, 3,900 tons of SO2, and 5,200 tons of particulates [7]. Reductions in these emissions translate into public health benefits, as these pollutants have been linked with problems such as asthma, bronchitis, lung cancer, and heart disease for hundreds of thousands of Americans [9].
However, despite these benefits, unconventional gas development can affect local and regional air quality. Some areas where drilling occurs have experienced increases in concentrations of hazardous air pollutants and two of the six “criteria pollutants” — particulate matter and ozone plus its precursors — regulated by the EPA because of their harmful effects on health and the environment [9]. Exposure to elevated levels of these air pollutants can lead to adverse health outcomes, including respiratory symptoms, cardiovascular disease, and cancer [11]. One recent study found that residents living less than half a mile from unconventional gas well sites were at greater risk of health effects from air pollution from natural gas development than those living farther from the well sites [12].
Land use and wildlife
The construction and land disturbance required for oil and gas drilling can alter land use and harm local ecosystems by causing erosion and fragmenting wildlife habitats and migration patterns. When oil and gas operators clear a site to build a well pad, pipelines, and access roads, the construction process can cause erosion of dirt, minerals, and other harmful pollutants into nearby streams [13].
A study of hydraulic fracturing impacts in Michigan found potential environmental impacts to be “significant” and include increased erosion and sedimentation, increased risk of aquatic contamination from chemical spills or equipment runoff, habitat fragmentation, and reduction of surface waters as a result of the lowering of groundwater levels [14].
Water use and pollution
Unconventional oil and gas development may pose health risks to nearby communities through contamination of drinking water sources with hazardous chemicals used in drilling the wellbore, hydraulically fracturing the well, processing and refining the oil or gas, or disposing of wastewater [15]. Naturally occurring radioactive materials, methane, and other underground gases have sometimes leaked into drinking water supplies from improperly cased wells; methane is not associated with acute health effects but in sufficient volumes may pose flammability concerns [16]. The large volumes of water used in unconventional oil and gas development also raise water-availability concerns in some communities.
Groundwater
There have been documented cases of groundwater near oil and gas wells being contaminated with fracking fluids as well as with gases, including methane and volatile organic compounds. One major cause of gas contamination is improperly constructed or failing wells that allow gas to leak from the well into groundwater. Cases of contamination have been documented in Ohio and Pennsylvania [17].
Another potential avenue for groundwater contamination is natural or man-made fractures in the subsurface, which could allow stray gas to move directly between an oil and gas formation and groundwater supplies.
In addition to gases, groundwater can become contaminated with hydraulic fracturing fluid [18]. In several cases, groundwater was contaminated from surface leaks and spills of fracturing fluid. Fracturing fluid also may migrate along abandoned wells, around improperly sealed and constructed wells, through induced fractures, or through failed wastewater pit liners [19].
Surface Water
Unconventional oil and gas development also poses contamination risks to surface waters through spills and leaks of chemical additives, spills and leaks of diesel or other fluids from equipment on-site, and leaks of wastewater from facilities for storage, treatment, and disposal. Unlike groundwater contamination risks, surface water contamination risks are mostly related to land management and to on- and off-site chemical and wastewater management.
The EPA has identified more than 1,000 chemical additives that are used for hydraulic fracturing, including acids (notably hydrochloric acid), bactericides, scale removers, and friction-reducing agents. Only maybe a dozen chemicals are used for any given well, but the choice of which chemicals is well-specific, depending on the geochemistry and needs of that well [20]. Large quantities — tens of thousands of gallons for each well — of the chemical additives are trucked to and stored on a well pad. If not managed properly, the chemicals could leak or spill out of faulty storage containers or during transport.
Drilling muds, diesel, and other fluids can also spill at the surface [21]. Improper management of flowback or produced wastewater can cause leaks and spills. There is also risk to surface water from deliberate improper disposal of wastewater by bad actors.
Water Use
The growth of hydraulic fracturing and its use of huge volumes of water per well may strain local ground and surface water supplies, particularly in water-scarce areas. The amount of water used for hydraulically fracturing a well can vary because of differences in formation geology, well construction, and the type of hydraulic fracturing process used [22]. The EPA estimates that 70 billion to 140 billion gallons of water were used nationwide in 2011 for fracturing an estimated 35,000 wells [23]. Unlike other energy-related water withdrawals, which are commonly returned to rivers and lakes, most of the water used for unconventional oil and gas development is not recoverable. Depending on the type of well along with its depth and location, a single well with horizontal drilling can require 3 million to 12 million gallons of water when it is first fractured — dozens of times more than what is used in conventional vertical wells [24]. Similar vast volumes of water are needed each time a well undergoes a “work over,” or additional fracturing later in its life to maintain well pressure and gas production. A typical shale gas well will have about two work overs during its productive life span [25].
Earthquakes
Hydraulic fracturing itself has been linked to low-magnitude seismic activity—less than 2 moment magnitude (M) [the moment magnitude scale now replaces the Richter scale]— but such mild events are usually undetectable at the surface [26]. The disposal of fracking wastewater by injecting it at high pressure into deep Class II injection wells, however, has been linked to larger earthquakes in the United States [27]. At least half of the 4.5 M or larger earthquakes to strike the interior of the United States in the past decade have occurred in regions of potential injection-induced seismicity [28]. Although it can be challenging to attribute individual earthquakes to injection, in many cases the association is supported by timing and location of the events [29].

As the world urbanizes and industrializes, and as effects of climate change intensify, environmental crises will increasingly devastate the lives, health, and livelihoods of people around the globe. A lack of legal regulation and enforcement of industrial and artisanal mining, large-scale dams, deforestation, domestic water and sanitation systems, and heavily polluting industries can lead to host of human rights violations. Activists and ordinary citizens defending their rights to land and the environment may face intimidation, legal harassment and deadly violence. The primary victims of environmental harm are often impoverished and marginalized communities with limited opportunity to meaningfully participate in decision-making and public debate on environmental issues, and have little access to independent courts to achieve accountability and redress.

Europe’s environment is at a tipping point. We have a narrow window of opportunity in the next decade to scale up measures to protect nature, lessen the impacts of climate change and radically reduce our consumption of natural resources.
Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director
While European environment and climate policies have helped to improve the environment over recent decades, Europe is not making enough progress and the outlook for the environment in the coming decade is not positive, according to the ‘European environment — state and outlook 2020 (SOER 2020)’ report.
SOER 2020 is the most comprehensive environmental assessment ever undertaken on Europe. It provides a stark snapshot of where Europe stands in meeting 2020 and 2030 policy targets as well as longer term 2050 goals and ambitions to shift to a sustainable, low carbon future. The report notes that Europe has already made significant progress over the past two decades in terms of climate change mitigation, reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Signs of progress are also evident in other areas, such as tackling air and water pollution and the introduction of new policies to tackle plastic waste and bolster climate change adaptation and the circular and bio-economy. Furthermore, the EU’s sustainable finance initiative is the first of its kind on the role of the financial sector in driving the necessary shift to a sustainable future.
While these achievements are significant, Europe will not achieve its sustainability vision of ‘living well within the limits of the planet’ by continuing to promote economic growth and seeking to manage the environmental and social impacts. The report urges European countries, leaders and policymakers to seize the opportunity and use the next decade to radically scale up and speed up actions to put Europe back on track to meeting its medium and longer-term environmental policy goals and targets to avoid irreversible change and damage.
The current range of European policy actions provide an essential foundation for future progress but they are not enough. Europe needs to do things better, it needs to address certain challenges differently, and it needs to rethink its investments. Achieving Europe’s goals will require better implementation and improved coordination between current policies. It will also need additional policy actions to achieve fundamental change in the key systems of production and consumption that underpin our modern lifestyles, such as food, energy and mobility, which have substantial environmental impacts.
The report also stresses the importance of how governments can enable a transition to sustainability and the need to address things differently. For example, Europe should rethink how it uses existing innovations and technologies, how production processes could be improved, how research and development into sustainability could be fostered and how changes in consumption patterns and ways of living could be stimulated.
Lastly, achieving such change will require investing in a sustainable future and stopping using public funds to subsidise environmentally damaging activities. Europe will gain immensely from such a change in investment priorities because of the economic and social opportunities that it can create. At the same time, it will be crucial to listen to public concerns and ensure widespread support for such a shift — a socially fair transition.
The State of the Environment Report is perfectly timed to give us the added impetus we need as we start a new five-year cycle in the European Commission and as we prepare to present the European Green Deal.
In the next five years we will put in place a truly transformative agenda, rolling out new clean technologies, helping citizens to adapt to new job opportunities and changing industries, and shifting to cleaner and more efficient mobility systems and more sustainable food and farming.
There will be multiple benefits for Europe and for Europeans if we get this right, and our economy and our planet will be winners too. This is an urgent global challenge, and a unique opportunity for Europe.
Frans Timmermans, Executive Vice President of the European Commission.
‘Europe’s environment is at a tipping point. We have a narrow window of opportunity in the next decade to scale up measures to protect nature, lessen the impacts of climate change and radically reduce our consumption of natural resources. Our assessment shows that incremental changes have resulted in progress in some areas but not nearly enough to meet our long-term goals. We already have the knowledge, technologies and tools we need to make key production and consumption systems such as food, mobility and energy sustainable. Our future well-being and prosperity depend on this and our ability to harness society wide action to bring about change and create a better future,’ said Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director.
Overall environmental trends in Europe have not improved since the last EEA state of the environment report in 2015. The assessment notes that while most of the 2020 targets will not be achieved, especially those on biodiversity, there is still a chance to meet the longer-term goals and objectives for 2030 and 2050.
Europe has made important gains in resource efficiency and the circular economy. But recent trends highlight a slowing down of progress in areas such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions, industrial emissions, waste generation, improving energy efficiency and the share of renewable energy. Looking ahead, the current rate of progress will not be enough to meet 2030 and 2050 climate and energy targets.
Protecting and conserving European biodiversity and nature remains the biggest area of discouraging progress. Of the 13 specific policy objectives set for 2020 in this area, only two are likely be met: designating marine protected areas and terrestrial protected areas. Looking ahead to 2030, if current trends continue, they will result in further deterioration of nature and continued pollution of air, water and soil.
Climate change, air and noise pollution impacts on the environment and human health are also still of concern. Exposure to fine particulate matter is responsible for around 400 000 premature deaths in Europe every year, affecting central and eastern European countries disproportionally. There is also growing concern over hazardous chemicals and the risks they pose. Looking ahead, the prospects for reducing environmental risks to health would be improved with better integration of environment and health policies.

Achieving Europe’s low carbon and sustainability vision is still possible. The report outlines seven key areas where bold action is needed to get Europe back on track to achieve its 2030 and 2050 goals and ambitions.
The European environment – state and outlook 2020 is published by the EEA every five years as mandated in its regulation. SOER 2020 is the 6th SOER published by the EEA since 1995. It offers solid, science-based insights on how we must respond to the huge and complex challenges we face, such as climate change, biodiversity loss and air and water pollution.
SOER 2020 has been prepared in close collaboration with the EEA’s European Environment Information and Observation Network (Eionet). The report draws on the Eionet’s vast expertise of leading experts and scientists in the environmental field, across the EEA’s 33 member countries and six cooperating countries.

The EU Eco-Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS) is a premium management instrument developed by the European Commission for companies and other organisations to evaluate, report, and improve their environmental performance. EMAS is open to every type of organisation eager to improve its environmental performance. It spans all economic and service sectors and is applicable worldwide.
Since the revision of the annexes of the EMAS Regulation, it is easier for an organisation already complying to an environmental management system such as ISO 14001 to step up to EMAS.
EMAS stands for…
…PERFORMANCE: EMAS supports organisations in finding the right tools to improve their environmental performance. Participating organisations voluntarily commit to both evaluating and reducing their environmental impact.
…CREDIBILITY: Third party verification guarantees the external and independent nature of the EMAS registration process.
…TRANSPARENCY: Providing publicly available information on an organisation’s environmental performance is an important aspect of EMAS. Organisations achieve greater transparency both externally through the environmental statement and internally through employees' active involvement.
With EMAS, your organisation can reduce its environmental impacts, strengthen legal compliance and employee involvement, and save resources and money!

Briefing
Globally, levels of air pollution and releases of nutrients from agriculture and wastewater remain high, causing acidification and eutrophication in ecosystems, and losses in agricultural yield. In the coming decades, overall pollution levels are projected to increase strongly, particularly in Asia.
Although Europe’s pollutant releases are expected to continue declining, European ecosystems and citizens are likely to be affected by developments in other regions. For example, despite a fall in air pollutant emissions there has not been an equivalent improvement in air quality across Europe, partly as a result of the transboundary transport of air pollutants.
Since the start of the industrial revolution in the 19th century environmental pollution has grown into a global transboundary problem that affects air, water, soil and ecosystems, and is linked directly to human health and well-being (GMT 3). A key driver is the growth of the global population, from an estimated 1 billion in at the beginning of the 19th century to more than 7 billion today (GMT 1). This, combined with rapid, albeit uneven, economic development, has led to a massive increase in global production, consumption and mobility, together with increased demand for food and energy.
Pollution is linked to three main human activities: fossil-fuel combustion, primarily by industry and transport; the application of synthetic fertilisers and pesticides in agriculture; and the growing use and complexity of chemicals.
From 1990 to 2010, annual global emissions from fossil fuels rose by 50 %, from around 6 billion tonnes to almost 9 billion tonnes.[1] Fertiliser application per agricultural unit varies, but is particularly intense in China and increasing strongly in India. In contrast, it is declining slightly in Europe, though it remains above the global average.[2] In terms of chemicals, more than 100 000 substances are commercially available in Europe alone, and the number of new substances coming on to the global market is increasing rapidly.[3]
Four main substances are cause for concern: nitrogen[5], sulphur, ozone[6] and particulate matter.
Atmospheric nitrogen pollution primarily consists of emissions of nitrogen oxides from industry and transport, and emissions of ammonia from agriculture.[1] Global emissions of nitrogen oxides increased rapidly until around 1990, then fell significantly in Europe[7] but continued to grow in Asia. According to the representative concentration pathways (RCP) projections[8], emissions of nitrogen oxides are projected to continue to decrease in Europe up to 2050. In Asia, decreases may only start after another two or three decades of increase. Global ammonia emissions have followed a similar trajectory, but unlike nitrogen oxides, further increases are projected in most regions, with the possible exception of Europe.[9]
The formation of ozone is mainly driven by anthropogenic emissions of ozone precursors, such as methane and nitrogen oxides. Global modelling suggests that annual mean ozone concentrations in Europe increased until about 1990. Concentrations in East and South Asia have continuously risen since the 1950s and are projected to increase further or remain at high levels in the coming decades (Figure 1) depending on assumptions regarding global and regional emission pathways, as well as changes in the climate system.[1]
Intercontinental transport of particulate matter and ozone is a growing concern.[9] Measurements in Europe and North America show that trans-oceanic air flows can lead to ozone concentrations that exceed air quality standards. Increasing emissions of methane and other precursors in other parts of the world might offset European emission-mitigation measures[9] – despite substantial reductions of ozone-precursor gases in 2002–2011, measured ozone concentrations in Europe have only decreased marginally. Similarly, reductions in particulate emissions in Europe have not led to proportional reductions in their concentrations.[10] These trends are at least partial evidence of the intercontinental transport of particulate matter and ozone-precursors.
Source: Wild et al. (2012)
Note: The graphs shows the results from a study that estimates regionally averaged changes in surface ozone due to past or future changes in anthropogenic precursor emissions based on 14 global chemistry transport models. Changes refer to ground-level ozone concentrations in 2000, expressed as parts per billion by volume (ppbv).
In addition to deposits from the air, pollution of water, including groundwater, and soil results from diffuse agricultural or urban/industrial sources. One example is reactive nitrogen pollution of coastal ecosystems from agricultural fertiliser run-off into streams and rivers.[12] At a global scale, increasing nitrogen and phosphorus pollution has become a major problem, as current levels may already exceed globally sustainable limits.[13]
Nutrient effluents from agriculture occur if synthetic fertiliser is applied inefficiently – in excess, at the wrong time, etc. Global fertiliser use is projected to increase markedly during the 21st century, from around 90 million tonnes in 2000[14] to potentially more than 150 million tonnes in 2050.[15] Projections based on the RCP scenarios suggest that intensified biofuel production could also lead to high nitrogen fertiliser consumption (Figure 2).[14] Thus, there could be trade-offs between greenhouse gas mitigation and pollution abatement.
Moreover, effluents from wastewater are projected to increase across the world, partly due to rapid urbanisation and the cost of adequate wastewater treatment systems. Globally, nitrogen and phosphorus effluents may increase by 180 % and 150 % respectively between 2000 and 2050, with, for example, the amount of phosphorus discharged annually into the Pacific Ocean possibly almost doubling between 2000 and 2050.[16]
Source: Winiwarter et al. (2013)
Note: Projections are based on the concepts of the RCPs.[17]
Diet optimisation refers to a shift in consumption towards foods produced with more effective nitrogen uptake. Efficiency increase refers to the ratio of nutrients taken up by crops to the total amount of nutrients applied to soil.
The acidification of freshwater ecosystems and soil in terrestrial ecosystems due to the deposition of airborne sulphur and nitrogen compounds poses a serious threat to global plant diversity[18] and the capacity of ecosystems to provide services (GMT 8). In such conditions, species well adapted to acidic environments are likely to thrive, displacing other plants and reducing diversity.[19] An annual deposition of 5–10 kg of nitrogen per hectare has been estimated as a general threshold value for adverse effects on biodiversity.[20] Acidic depositions in Europe have declined significantly since the 1980s.[21] However, Asian and African ecosystems may face increased risk of acidification in the coming 50 years, depending on the interplay of soil properties, individual site-management and regional and international policies. Areas at particular risk are South, Southeast and East Asia, where little of the emitted substances are neutralised by atmospheric alkaline desert dust.[22] At a global scale, 40 % of protected areas currently designated under the Convention on Biological Diversity received annual nitrogen depositions exceeding the threshold of 10 kg per hectare in 2000.[23]
Ozone makes it harder for plants to photosynthesise, so high levels of ozone may also have significant effects on biodiversity and crops.[24] This might, for example, take the form of changes in the species composition of semi-natural vegetation communities[25] or reductions in tree productivity.[26] Some locations at high risk of ozone effects also face substantial risks from nitrogen deposition.[20] Examples include the forests of Southeast Asia and southwest China.
The eutrophication of aquatic ecosystems is caused by high nutrient concentrations, in particular phosphates and nitrates. These have been linked to serious losses of aquatic life[27] and may cause hypoxia – aquatic ecosystems lacking sufficient oxygen to support most forms of life, producing dead zones.[28] In the three years between 2008 and 2011 the number of eutrophication cases in marine ecosystems reported globally increased from around 400 to more than 750.[29] Dead zones are particularly common along the coasts of North America, East Asia and Europe.[30] Indeed, the Baltic Sea has been characterised as the largest human-induced hypoxic area globally, with a ten-fold increase in hypoxia over the last 115 years, mainly due to effluents from agriculture.[31]
Similarly, eutrophication of freshwater ecosystems – rivers and lakes – also remains a key challenge.[1] Assuming that existing legislative frameworks remain unchanged, estimates suggest that the number of lakes with hypoxia may increase globally by 20 % by 2050.[16]
Global agricultural production is affected by high concentrations of ozone, as well as by other threats including climate change (GMT 9). In rural areas, elevated ozone levels tend to last longer and potentially cause a wide variety of damage to various ecosystems, notably decreasing crop yields.
Global estimates suggest that the range of current relative yield losses (RYL) are 7–12 % for wheat, 6–16 % for soybeans, 3–4 % for rice, and 3–5 % for maize.[32] Highly productive agricultural areas, such as parts of Europe, India, and the mid-west United States, are particularly affected by substantial production losses due to ozone. Assuming that current legislation remains unchanged, yield losses are projected to increase, especially in Asia, and particularly of soybeans and maize. In Europe and North America yield loss is projected to fall (Figure 3).[33]
Source: UNEP and WHO (2011)
Note: the 2030 scenario assumes the implementation of current legislation for the major world regions. Positive relative yield loss values signify increased yield losses in 2030 compared with 2005.

[4] For details of air pollution, agriculture and water see the SOER 2015 European briefings.
[5] Nitrogen makes up almost 80 % of the atmosphere in the form of nitrogen gases but can only be used by plants and animals if converted into another chemical form: reactive nitrogen. This process of nitrogen fixation occurs in three main ways: by lightning or high-temperature combustion (e.g. car exhausts and industrial combustion); by nitrogen-fixing plants (e.g. legumes); and by the industrial creation of synthetic nitrogen fertilisers. Reactive nitrogen is also released from animal manure.
[6] Ozone pollution as described throughout this publication refers to ozone concentrations at or near the Earth’s surface (from the surface to 12–20 kms above it, referred to as tropospheric ozone), which can have adverse impacts for humans and the natural environment. The Earth's ozone layer is mainly found in the lower portion of the stratosphere, approximately 20–30 kms above Earth.
[7] This does not apply to emissions from international shipping. Nitrogen dioxide emissions from international shipping are estimated to have increased by around 25 % for 2000–2007 only.[35]
[8] Projections of changes in the climate systems as given here utilise a new set of emissions scenarios, the representative concentration pathways (RCPs; 28). The RCPs are four scenarios for levels of atmospheric greenhouse gases in the years up to 2100. They vary from a scenario in which greenhouse gas concentrations increase moderately between now and 2100 (RCP 2.6), to scenarios with greater levels of greenhouse gas concentrations (RCPs 4.5 and 6); all the way to a scenario in which greenhouse gas concentrations increase very greatly (RCP 8.5 – the scenario toward which greenhouse gas emissions are currently heading if no further abatement measures are taken). The RCPs were developed to aid climate modelling and underpin the Fifth Assessment Report of the IPCC. They do not necessarily represent probable future socioeconomic pathways.

The European Green Deal provides an action plan to
- boost the efficient use of resources by moving to a clean, circular economy
- restore biodiversity and cut pollution
The plan outlines investments needed and financing tools available. It explains how to ensure a just and inclusive transition.
The EU aims to be climate neutral in 2050. We proposed a European Climate Law to turn this political commitment into a legal obligation.
Reaching this target will require action by all sectors of our economy, including
- investing in environmentally-friendly technologies
- supporting industry to innovate
- rolling out cleaner, cheaper and healthier forms of private and public transport
- decarbonising the energy sector
- ensuring buildings are more energy efficient
- working with international partners to improve global environmental standards
The EU will also provide financial support and technical assistance to help those that are most affected by the move towards the green economy. This is called the Just Transition Mechanism. It will help mobilise at least €100 billion over the period 2021-2027 in the most affected regions.

- . Why a EU taxonomy
In order to meet the EU’s climate and energy targets for 2030 and reach the objectives of the European Green Deal, it is fundamental to direct investments towards sustainable projects and activities. The current COVID-19 pandemic has reinforced the need to redirect capital flows towards sustainable projects in order to make our economies, businesses and societies, in particular health systems, more resilient against climate and environmental shocks and risks with clear co-benefits for health.
To achieve this, a common language and a clear definition of what is ‘sustainable’ is needed. This is why the action plan on financing sustainable growth called for the creation of a common classification system for sustainable economic activities, or an “EU taxonomy”.
What is the EU taxonomy
The EU taxonomy is a classification system, establishing a list of environmentally sustainable economic activities. The EU taxonomy is an important enabler to scale up sustainable investment and to implement the European Green Deal. Notably, by providing appropriate definitions to companies, investors and policymakers on which economic activities can be considered environmentally sustainable, it is expected to create security for investors, protect private investors from greenwashing, help companies to plan the transition, mitigate market fragmentation and eventually help shift investments where they are most needed.
The Commission is currently preparing an IT tool that will facilitate the use of the taxonomy by allowing users to navigate easily through the taxonomy.
Taxonomy Regulation and delegated acts
The Taxonomy Regulation was published in the Official Journal of the European Union on 22 June 2020 and entered into force on 12 July 2020. It establishes the framework for the EU taxonomy by setting out four overarching conditions that an economic activity has to meet in order to qualify as environmentally sustainable.
The Taxonomy Regulation establishes six environmental objectives
- Climate change mitigation
- Climate change adaptation
- The sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources
- The transition to a circular economy
- Pollution prevention and control
- The protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems
Different means can be required for an activity to make a substantial contribution to each objective.
More information on the Taxonomy Regulation
The Taxonomy Regulation tasks the Commission with establishing the actual list of environmentally sustainable activities by defining technical screening criteria for each environmental objective through delegated acts.
A first delegated act on sustainable activities for climate change adaptation and mitigation objectives was published on 21 April 2021. A second delegated act for the remaining objectives will be published in 2022.
The publication of the first delegated act was accompanied by the adoption of a Commission Communication on ‘EU Taxonomy, corporate sustainability reporting, sustainability preferences and fiduciary duties: Directing finance towards the European Green Deal’ that aimed at delivering key messages on how the sustainable finance toolbox facilitates access to finance for the transition. This Communication builds on the transition finance report adopted by the Platform on Sustainable Finance in March 2021.
In 2021, the Commission will adopt another delegated act specifying the information companies subject to the non-financial reporting directive (NFRD) will have to disclose on how, and to what extent, their activities align with those considered environmentally sustainable in the EU taxonomy, building on the technical advice submitted by the European Supervisory Authorities (advice by ESMA, advice by EBA, advice by EIOPA) on 1 March 2021.
More information on the delegated acts
Assessment of nuclear energy
In 2020, the Commission launched in-depth work to assess whether or not to include nuclear energy in the EU taxonomy of environmentally sustainable activities. As the first step, the Joint Research Centre, the in-house science and knowledge service of the Commission, drafted a technical report on the ‘do no significant harm’ aspects of nuclear energy. This publication is a Science for Policy report by the JRC, which aims to provide evidence-based scientific support to the European policymaking process. The scientific output expressed does not imply a policy position of the European Commission. This report will now be reviewed by two sets of experts, the Group of Experts on radiation protection and waste management under Article 31 of the Euratom Treaty, as well as the Scientific Committee on Health, Environmental and Emerging Risks on environmental impacts. They are expected to issue their reports within three months. These three reports will inform the Commission’s decision.
Further development: the Platform on sustainable finance
The development of the EU taxonomy relies on extensive input from experts from across the economy and civil society. This is why the Platform on sustainable finance is tasked with advising the European Commission on further developing the EU taxonomy, improving its usability and exploring its extension to social objectives, activities that significantly harm the environment or activities that are neutral towards the environment.
The Platform on sustainable finance is a permanent Commission expert group that has been established under the Taxonomy Regulation.

Preparatory work: Final report of the TEG
In order to inform its work on the action plan, including on the EU taxonomy, the European Commission established a Technical Expert Group (TEG) on sustainable finance in July 2018.
Within the framework of the Taxonomy Regulation, the TEG was asked to develop recommendations for technical screening criteria for economic activities that can make a substantial contribution to climate change mitigation and adaptation, while avoiding significant harm to the four other environmental objectives (sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources, transition to a circular economy, pollution prevention control, and protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems).
On 9 March 2020, the TEG published its final report on EU taxonomy. The report contains recommendations relating to the overarching design of the EU taxonomy, as well as extensive implementation guidance on how companies and financial institutions can use and disclose against the EU taxonomy. The report is supplemented by a technical annex containing
- Updated technical screening criteria for 70 climate change mitigation and 68 climate change adaptation activities, including criteria for do no significant harm to other environmental objectives
- An updated methodology section to support the recommendations on the technical screening criteria
The TEG has also prepared excel tools to help users of the Taxonomy to implement it in their own activities.
This report builds on the work that the TEG published in June 2019 and the early feedback report published in December 2018. Both reports were subject to an open call for feedback to gather views from stakeholders. The responses authorised for publication can be found below:
- responses on the first call for feedback
- responses to the second round of feedback on the June 2019 report
In order to respond to the most frequently asked questions by stakeholders about the TEG’s final report and the Commission’s next steps, a joint document with frequently asked questions has been published by the Commission and the TEG.
During its mandate, the TEG also engaged with over 200 additional experts to develop their recommendations for the technical screening criteria.

Briefing
Europe's resource efficiency has improved in recent years but this has not always translated into improved ecosystem resilience or reduced risks to health and well-being. Creating a green economy will require fundamental changes in the production-consumption systems that meet basic demands, such as for food, mobility, energy and housing. This will depend on better implementation and integration of environmental and economic policies, a broader knowledge base for long-term transitions, and use of finance and fiscal policies to support major investments in innovation and infrastructure.
The concept of the ‘green economy’ has emerged in recent years as a strategic priority for governments and intergovernmental organisations.[e.g. 1][2] In Europe, it features prominently in a range of medium- and long-term EU programmes and strategies, including the Europe 2020 Strategy,[3] the 7th Environment Action Programme,[4] the EU Framework Programme for Research and Innovation (Horizon 2020)[5] and sectoral policies in areas such as transport and energy.

Note: Please read reference [6] for additional information.
The growing prominence of the green economy in EU policy reflects a recognition that the prevailing economic paradigm is inconsistent with Europe’s long-term development goals, encapsulated in the 2050 vision of ‘living well within the planet’s limits’.[4] Across the world, the transition to high levels of human development has been achieved by adopting production and consumption patterns that put a disproportionate burden on the environment (Figure 1). As a result, some countries today live well, while others live within the limits of the planet. None do both.
A ‘green’ economy is essentially one in which socio-economic systems are organised in ways that enable society to live well within planetary boundaries. The concept therefore has several dimensions. The first is a focus on increasing resource efficiency: identifying the innovations and approaches that enable society to extract maximum value from resources and minimise harmful emissions and waste.
Although essential, resource efficiency alone will not guarantee that natural capital stocks are maintained for future generations or that economic activity delivers acceptable living standards and social cohesion. Efforts to enhance resource efficiency must therefore be complemented with a focus on ecosystem resilience and on people's well-being. After all, an economic model that transcends ecosystem boundaries will not be sustainable in the long term; one that cannot provide decent jobs and earnings will not be politically or socially viable.
Europe’s resource efficiency has increased in recent years, alleviating some of the environmental pressures associated with economic production. For example, EU-28 greenhouse gas emissions have decreased by 19 % since 1990 despite a 45 % increase in gross domestic product. Fossil fuel use has also declined, as have emissions of some pollutants from transport and industry. More recently, the EU’s total resource use has declined by 19 % since 2007, less waste is being generated and recycling rates have improved in nearly every country.
These trends potentially mark important progress in Europe’s efforts to reconfigure its production-consumption systems but significant problems persist. European resource use and harmful emissions remain high in absolute terms. Some of the apparent efficiency improvements may partially reflect the relocation of material extraction and manufacturing to other parts of the world. And the level of ambition of existing environmental policy may be inadequate to achieve Europe’s long-term environment and climate objectives. For example, projected greenhouse gas emissions reductions are currently insufficient to bring the EU onto a pathway towards its target of reducing emissions by 80–95 % by 2050.
In addition, Europe’s recent progress in reducing environmental pressures has not always been matched by improved ecosystem resilience or reduced risks to people's health and well-being. For example, although water pollution is declining, most freshwater bodies across Europe are not expected to achieve good ecological status by 2015. Similarly, Europe is not on track to meet its overall target of halting biodiversity loss by 2020, even though some more specific targets are being met. Loss of soil functions, land degradation and climate change remain major threats to ecosystem resilience, undermining flows of environmental goods and services and therefore jeopardising the social resilience of communities reliant on them.
Turning to people's health and well-being, there have been marked improvements in the quality of drinking water and bathing water and some reductions in hazardous pollutants. However, air and noise pollution continue to cause serious health impacts. In 2011, about 430 000 premature deaths in the EU were attributed to fine particulate matter (PM2.5),[7] while exposure to environmental noise is estimated to contribute to at least 10 000 premature deaths due to coronary heart disease and strokes each year.[8] Environmental impacts on human health and well-being are particularly pronounced in urban settings where multiple pressures coexist. Conversely, well planned urban areas providing easy access to natural, green environments can deliver substantial health and well-being benefits, including protection from the impacts of climate change.[9]
Environmental policies are also creating socio-economic opportunities and thereby contributing to the Europe 2020 Strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. For example, employment in the environment industry sector, which produces goods and services that reduce environmental degradation and maintain natural resources, increased by 44 % between 2000 and 2011, while sectoral value added increased by 57 %. It has been one of the few economic sectors to have flourished in terms of revenues, trade and jobs since the 2008 financial crisis.
The trends set out above indicate that although policy has delivered some important advances, Europe remains a long way from achieving the transition to a green economy.
In part this reflects the fact that the complex links between environmental and socio-economic systems can undermine efforts to reduce environmental pressures and related impacts. For example, technology-driven efficiency gains may be undermined by lifestyle changes or increased consumption, partly because efficiency improvements can make outputs cheaper (the rebound effect). Policies and local management efforts can be counteracted by external pressures related to global megatrends. Changing exposure patterns and human vulnerabilities, for example linked to urbanisation, can offset reductions in pressures. And the unsustainable systems of production and consumption that are responsible for many environmental pressures also provide diverse benefits, such as jobs and earnings, which can create strong incentives for sectors or communities to resist change.
The systemic, transboundary and long-term characteristics of the environmental challenges facing Europe indicate that neither environmental policies alone, nor economic and technology-driven efficiency gains will be sufficient to effect the transition to a green economy. Rather, transition will require more fundamental changes in the global production-consumption systems that meet basic demands, such as for food, mobility, energy and shelter.
The 7th Environment Action Programme sets out four key pillars of an enabling framework for the transition to a green economy: implementation, integration, information and investments. In a green economy approach, the focus is on identifying synergies that enable economic, environmental and social objectives to be advanced concurrently.
For example, implementation of environmental regulations plays an important role in protecting ecosystems but can also contribute to enhanced resource-efficiency by incentivising companies to invest in eco-innovation. This in turn gives businesses a ‘first-mover’ advantage to export their innovations abroad, thus generating earnings and jobs. Major EU engineering companies already earn up to 40 % of revenues from their environment portfolios, and this is set to increase.[10] Similarly, taxing environmentally damaging activities can raise revenues, allowing governments to reduce taxes on labour or reduce budget deficits. Combined with eliminating environmentally harmful subsidies, such fiscal reforms are essential in the transition to a green economy.
The green economy perspective provides a framework for integrating the environment into the policies of key economic sectors. For example, European policy on material resource use can be represented as a nested set of objectives (Figure 2). Whereas a circular economy focuses on optimising material resource flows by minimising waste, the green economy approach extends the focus to how water, energy, land and biodiversity should be managed to secure ecosystem resilience and human well-being. The green economy also addresses wider issues, such as competitiveness and unequal exposure to environmental pressures and access to green spaces.
In addition, efforts to promote a renaissance of industry in Europe[e.g.11] could form part of an integrated approach to managing production and consumption so as to ensure that efficiency improvements are secured across the supply chain.
Expanding the environmental knowledge base can support better implementation and integration of environment and climate policy, inform investment choices, and support long-term transitions. An expanded knowledge base also enables policymakers and businesses to take decisions that fully reflect environmental limits, risks, uncertainties, benefits and costs.
At present there is a gap between available, established monitoring, data and indicators and the knowledge required to support transitions. Addressing this gap requires investment in better understanding of systems science, forward-looking information, systemic risks, and the relationship between environmental change and human well-being. Accounting systems — both physical and monetary — are also important to inform policy and investment decisions, because getting the balance right between use, protection and enhancement of natural capital requires information on the current status of stocks and flows.[12][13]
Investment has an essential role in the transition to a green economy, in part because the systems that meet basic social needs such as water, energy and mobility rely on costly and long-lasting infrastructure. Investment choices can therefore have long-term implications for the functioning of these systems and their impacts, as well as for the viability of alternative technologies. Transitions depend in part on avoiding investments that lock in existing technologies, limit options, or hinder the development of substitutes.
Enormous amounts of capital are needed to finance infrastructure such as smart electrical grids, renewable energies, electrification of transport, and resource-efficient buildings. In addition to fiscal reforms, innovative financing mechanisms, such as the project bond initiative of the European Commission and the European Investment Bank, socially responsible investments (SRI), green bonds and sovereign wealth funds (SWF), are potential tools for supplying the needed funds.[14]
Designing actionable, credible and feasible green economy pathways can put Europe at the frontier of science and technology. But effecting the needed transitions will demand ingenuity, creativity, courage and a greater sense of urgency.

nih,https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/ https://www.niehs.nih.gov/research/supported/translational/justice/index.cfm https://kids.niehs.nih.gov/ ," . Environmental factors such as air and water quality are fundamental determinants of our health and well-being. Environmental factors can lead to disease and health disparities when the places where people live, work, learn, and play are burdened by social inequities.
These social inequities, often referred to as social determinants of health, include differences in individual behaviors, cultural influences, access to health services, economic status, and literacy levels. Environmental health disparities exist when communities exposed to a combination of poor environmental quality and social inequities have more sickness and disease than wealthier, less polluted communities.
NIEHS’ commitment to reducing environmental health disparities is a goal in our Strategic Plan. NIEHS promotes translation of research results into a collective body of knowledge that informs and supports public health action. Over the past two decades, NIEHS has supported research programs, community-engaged activities, and training and education programs to address the disparate health impacts of environmental hazards on disadvantaged communities and ensure environmental health equity.
What NIEHS Is Doing
Center Programs
NIEHS supports research and activities that aim to reduce environmental health disparities and promote environmental justice through a variety of programs, which are made up of interdisciplinary teams of researchers and medical professionals.
Centers of Excellence on Environmental Health Disparities Research
The Centers of Excellence on Environmental Health Disparities Research (EHD Centers) program is a collaborative effort supported by NIEHS, the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
The EHD Centers encourage basic, epidemiological, and social scientific investigations of disease conditions that significantly burden low socioeconomic populations and those with health disparities. The Centers support research efforts, mentoring, capacity building, research translation, and information dissemination, and are designed to address program-specific research priorities.
Learn more about the EHD Centers and their primary areas of research.
Grantees at the University of New Mexico are addressing environmental health disparities through biomedical and environmental research and culturally appropriate community engagement methods. The researchers are focused on exposures to metal mixtures from mining sites.
Children’s Environmental Health Translation Centers
Applying an innovative concept, these new Centers will support scientists, health care professionals, and local communities by developing and testing strategies for communicating information about children’s environmental health. These strategies may include short courses for medical staff, social media tools, ways to report personalized data on environmental exposures, and risk communication methods.
Superfund Research Program
The NIEHS Superfund Research Program (SRP) funds multidisciplinary research on human health and environmental issues related to hazardous substances. Teams of diverse professionals develop, test, and implement unique, solution-oriented approaches to address complex environmental health problems.
SRP grantees proactively communicate their scientific accomplishments to the public through community outreach and engagement cores, to industry via technology transfer, or to government through partnerships.
Grantees at the University of California, San Diego build capacity of vulnerable communities to identify, prioritize, and resolve environmental and public health issues related to Superfund toxicants. They also facilitate knowledge exchange between researchers and local communities to improve nutrition and lower health disparities in disadvantaged neighborhoods.
Environmental Health Science Core Centers
The NIEHS Environmental Health Science (EHS) Core Centers Program facilitates scientific collaboration and utilizes cutting-edge technologies to advance understanding about how pollutants and other environmental factors may affect health and disease.
EHS Core Centers across the country, each with their own strategic vision and scientific focus, share common goals in advancing scientific research, promoting community engagement, advancing translational research, and training new researchers.
Researchers study the impacts of living and working in an urban setting on health. They work with community partners to understand how complex exposures to chemical and non-chemical stressors may lead to diseases, such as asthma and cancer.
Breast Cancer and the Environment Research Program
The Breast Cancer and the Environment Research Program (BCERP), jointly funded by NIEHS and the National Cancer Institute, supports the advancement of research on genetic and environmental factors that could affect a woman’s chance of developing breast cancer. Grantees use targeted communication strategies to educate women, health care professionals, advocates, and the public on ways to reduce breast cancer risk.
Researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles, follow a cohort of Latina girls in Chile to explore how exposure to harmful contaminants during puberty may alter breast composition and susceptibility to breast cancer. Research findings are disseminated through community outreach efforts.
Community Engaged Research
NIEHS fosters community involvement in research through both solicited and unsolicited projects.
Research to Action
The Research to Action (R2A) program brings together community members and researchers to investigate the potential health risks of environmental exposures that are of concern to the community. A key component of the program is the meaningful involvement of communities in both data collection and research translation.
HAPI is working to reduce childhood asthma among Latino children living in the Yakima Valley of Washington State by combining asthma education and health assessments with an air filter intervention. This project relies heavily on community leadership to identify research questions, maintain day to day conduct of the study, perform health assessments, and educate families.
Climate Change and Human Health
The most vulnerable people — children, the elderly, the poor, and those with underlying health conditions—are at increased risk for health effects from a changing climate. The NIEHS Climate Change and Human Health Research program funds research aimed at understanding the health impacts of climate change and how strategies used to adapt to or lessen climate change might affect health adversely.
NIEHS funded researchers study many factors that may increase the likelihood that older adults have health problems due to weather extremes. These factors include weather and air pollution interactions, as well as community characteristics, such as socioeconomic status and green space.
Partnerships for Environmental Public Health
Partnerships for Environmental Public Health (PEPH) is a network of scientists, community members, educators, healthcare providers, public health officials, and policymakers who share the goal of increasing the impact of environmental public health research at the local, regional, and national level. PEPH defines environmental public health as the science of conducting and translating research into action to address environmental exposures and health risks of concern to the public.
ACAT is working with collaborators to assess multiple routes of exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals in Native Alaskan communities in response to community requests. They are also providing information and training for the community so that they can plan and participate in public health actions.
Training and Education
NIEHS supports training and education through several programs. Training and education programs are important to build capacity to conduct research or enhance environmental health literacy within communities, among underrepresented groups, and among people who may come in to contact with environmental health hazards through their occupations.
Worker Training Program
The NIEHS Worker Training Program (WTP) funds nonprofit organizations to provide health and safety training to workers across the country. Workers come from a broad range of industries and occupations involved in handling or responding to emergency releases of hazardous materials.
Each nonprofit organization funded by WTP focuses on training activities in specific program areas, including Superfund related activities, clean-up of nuclear weapons facilities, and biosafety and infectious disease activities.
WTP and the National Clearinghouse for Worker Safety and Health Training released a report summarizing training accomplishments for grantees’ work with Native American tribes and Alaska Natives from 2015 to 2017. It describes how training efforts protected tribal workers, increased employment opportunities, and built capacity to respond to disasters.
Environmental Health Science Education
NIEHS focuses on environmental health science (EHS) education in a variety of areas. These include K-12 EHS education, education through the community engagement cores and training cores, summer research experiences for high school and undergraduate students, and technology transfer programs.
Highlight: Environmental Health Curriculum in After-School Program
Grantees at Texas A&M University work with collaborators to provide a six-week environmental health curriculum to students at Furr High School in Houston during an after-school program called “Genius Time”. The program provides instruction and facilitates hands-on learning activities for students on topics such as climate change and the relationship between exposure to chemicals in plastic and puberty.
Other NIEHS Contributions to Advancing Environmental Justice
The Advancing Environmental Justice (3MB) report highlights the contributions to environmental justice by the NIEHS Division of Extramural Research and Training (DERT). It provides a brief history of the environmental justice movement, the role of and funding investments made by DERT, an analysis of those contributions, conclusions, and suggested next steps. .

No two people live in the exact same environment. The SOIL beneath our feet, the AIR we breathe, and the WATER flowing through our pipes and waterways can all differ greatly, depending on where we live. On top of that, each of us eats different foods, shares our space with different plants and animals, and has access to different medicines and technology.

The impact of war on the environment and human health
|“Warfare is inherently destructive of sustainable development. States shall therefore respect international law providing protection for the environment in times of armed conflict and cooperate in its further development, as necessary.” – 1992 Rio Declaration|
The application of weapons, the destruction of structures and oil fields, fires, military transport movements and chemical spraying are all examples of the destroying impact war may have on the environment. Air, water and soil are polluted, man and animal are killed, and numerous health affects occur among those still living. This page is about the environmental effects of wars and incidents leading to war that have occurred in the 20th and 21st century.

“My hands are tied
The billions shift from side to side
And the wars go on with brainwashed pride
For the love of God and our human rights
And all these things are swept aside
By bloody hands time can't deny
And are washed away by your genocide
And history hides the lies of our civil wars” – Guns ‘n Roses (Civil War)
In Africa many civil wars and wars between countries occurred in the past century, some of which are still continuing. Most wars are a result of the liberation of countries after decades of colonialization. Countries fight over artificial borders drawn by former colonial rulers. Wars mainly occur in densely populated regions, over the division of scarce resources such as fertile farmland. It is very hard to estimate the exact environmental impact of each of these wars. Here, a summary of some of the most striking environmental effects, including biodiversity loss, famine, sanitation problems at refugee camps and over fishing is given for different countries.
Congo war (II) – Since August 1998 a civil war is fought in former Zaire, now known as the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). The war eventually ended in 2003 when a Transitional Government took power. A number of reasons are given for the conflict, including access and control of water resources and rich minerals and political agendas. Currently over 3 million people have died in the war, mostly from disease and starvation. More than 2 million people have become refugees. Only 45% of the people had access to safe drinking water. Many women were raped as a tool of intimidation, resulting in a rapid spread of sexually transmitted diseases such as HIV-AIDS. The war has a devastating effect on the environment. National parks housing endangered species are often affected for exploitation of minerals and other resources. Refugees hunt wildlife for bush meat, either to consume or sell it. Elephant populations in Africa have seriously declined as a result of ivory poaching. Farmers burn parts of the forest to apply as farmland, and corporate logging contributes to the access of poachers to bush meat. A survey by the WWF showed that the hippopotamus population in one national park decreased from 29,000 thirty years previously, to only 900 in 2005. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) listed all five parks as ‘world heritage in danger’.
Ethiopia & Eritrea – Before 1952, Eritrea was a colony of Italy. When it was liberated, Ethiopia annexed the country. Thirty years of war over the liberation of Eritrea followed, starting in 1961 and eventually ending with the independence of Eritrea in 1993. However, war commenced a year after the country introduced its own currency in 1997. Over a minor border dispute, differences in ethnicity and economic progress, Ethiopia again attacked Eritrea. The war lasted until June 2000 and resulted in the death of over 150,000 Eritrean, and of hundreds of thousands of Ethiopians. During the war severe drought resulted in famine, particularly because most government funds were spend on weapons and other war instrumentation. The government estimated that after the war only 60% of the country received adequate food supplies. The war resulted in over 750,000 refugees. It basically destroyed the entire infrastructure. Efforts to disrupt agricultural production in Eritrea resulted in changes in habitat. The placing of landmines has caused farming or herding to be very dangerous in most parts of the country. If floods occur landmines may be washed into cities. This has occurred earlier in Mozambique.
Rwanda civil war - Between April and July 1994 extremist military Hutu groups murdered about 80,000-1,000,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus in Rwanda. Over 2,000,000 people lost their homes and became refugees. Rwanda has a very rich environment, however, it has a particularly limited resource base. About 95% of the population lives on the countryside and relies on agriculture. Some scientists believe that competition for scarce land and resources led to violence prior to and particularly after the 1994 genocide. It is however stated that resource scarcity only contributed limitedly to the conflict under discussion. The main cause of the genocide was the death of the president from a plane-crash caused by missiles fires from a camp.
The many refugees from the 1994 combat caused a biodiversity problem. When they returned to the already overpopulated country after the war, they inhabited forest reserves in the mountains where endangered gorillas lived. Conservation of gorilla populations was no longer effective, and refuges destroyed part of the habitat. Despite the difficulties still present in Rwanda particularly concerning security and resource provision, an international gorilla protection group is now working on better conditions for the gorillas in Rwanda.
Somalia civil war – A civil war was fought in Somalia 1991. One of the most striking effects of the war was over fishing. The International Red Cross was encouraging the consumption of seawater fish to improve diets of civilians. For self-sufficiency they provided training and fishing equipment. However, as a consequence of war Somali people ignored international fishing protocols, thereby seriously harming ecology in the region. Fishing soon became an unsustainable practise, and fishermen are hard to stop because they started carrying arms. They perceive over fishing as a property right and can therefore hardly be stopped.
Sudan (Darfur & Chad) – In Sudan civil war and extreme droughts caused a widespread famine, beginning in 1983. Productive farmland in the southern region was abandoned during the war. Thousands of people became refugees that left behind their land, possibly never to return. Attempts of remaining farmers to cultivate new land to grow crops despite the drought led to desertification and soil erosion. The government failed to act for fear of losing its administrative image abroad, causing the famine to kill an estimated 95,000 of the total 3,1 million residents of the province Darfur. As farmers started claiming more and more land, routes applied by herders were closed off. This resulted in conflicts between farmers and rebels groups. In 2003, a conflict was fought in Darfur between Arab Sudanese farmers and non-Arab Muslims. The Muslim group is called Janjaweed, a tribe mainly consisting of nomadic sheep and cattle herders. Originally the Janjaweed were part of the Sudanese and Darfurian militia, and were armed by the Sudanese government to counter rebellion. However, they started utilizing the weapons against non-Muslim civilians. The tribe became notorious for massacre in 2003-2004. In December 2005 the conflict continued across the border, now involving governmental army troops from Chad, and the rebel groups Janjaweed and United Front for Democratic Change from Sudan. In February 2006 the governments of Chad and Sudan signed a peace treaty called the Tripoli Agreement. Unfortunately a new rebel assault of the capital of Chad in April made Chad break all ties with Sudan. The Darfur Conflict so far caused the death of between 50,000 and 450,000 civilians. It caused over 45,000 people to flea the countries of Sudan and Central Africa, into north and east Chad. Most refugees claim they fled civilian attacks from rebel forces, looting food and recruiting young men to join their troops.
Pearl Harbor (WWII) – When World War II began, Japan signed the Tripartite Pact with Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy. Consequentially, the United States closed the Panama Canal to Japanese shipping, and initiated a complete oil embargo. Japan, being dependent on US oil, responded to the embargo violently. On December 1941, Japanese troops carried out a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, aimed at the US Navy stationed there. Despite the awareness that Japan might attack, the US was surprisingly unprepared for the Japanese aggression. There were no aircraft patrols, and anti-aircraft weapons were not manned.
For the attack five Japanese submarines were present in the harbor to launch torpedos. One was discovered immediately, and attacked by the USS Ward. All five submarines sank, and at least three of them have not been located since. As Japanese bombers arrived they began firing at US marine airbases across Hawaii, and subsequently battle ships in Pearl Harbor. Eighteen ships sank, including five battleships, and a total of more than 2,000 Americans were killed in action. The explosion of the USS Arizona caused half of the casualties. The ship was hit by a bomb, burned for two days in a row, and subsequently sank to the bottom. The cloud of black smoke over the boat was mainly caused by burning black powder from the magazine for aircraft catapults aboard the ship.
Leaking fuel from the Arizona and other ships caught fire, and caused more ships to catch fire. Of the 350 Japanese planes taking part in the attack, 29 were lost. Over sixty Japanese were killed in actions, most of them airmen.
Today, three battle ships are still at the bottom of the harbor. Four others were raised and reused. The USS Arizona, being the most heavily damaged ship during the attack, continues to leak oil from the hulk into the harbor. However, the wreck is maintained, because it now serves as part of a war memorial.
World Trade Centre explosion - The so-called ‘War on Terrorism’ the United States are fighting in Asia currently all started with the event we recall so well from the shocking images projected on news bulletins. On September 11, 2001, terrorists flew airplanes into the buildings of the World Trade Centre. It is now claimed that the attack and simultaneous collapse of the Twin Towers caused a serious and acute environmental disaster.
""We will live in the death smog for a while,
breathing the dust of the dead,
the 3 thousand or so who turn to smoke,
as the giant ashtray in Lower Manhattan
continues to give up ghosts.
The dead are in us now,
locked in our chests,
staining our lungs,
polluting our bloodstreams.
And though we cover our faces with flags
and other pieces of cloth to filter the air,
the spirits of the dead aren’t fooled
by our masks."" Lawrence Swan, 05-10-2001
As the planes hit the Twin Towers more than 90.000 litres of jet fuel burned at temperatures above 1000oC. An atmospheric plume formed, consisting of toxic materials such as metals, furans, asbestos, dioxins, PAH, PCB and hydrochloric acid. Most of the materials were fibres from the structure of the building. Asbestos levels ranged from 0.8-3.0% of the total mass. PAH comprised more than 0.1% of the total mass, and PCBs less than 0.001% of total mass. At the site now called Ground Zero, a large pile of smoking rubble burned intermittently for more than 3 months. Gaseous and particulate particles kept forming long after the towers had collapsed.
Aerial photograph of the plume
The day of the attacks dust particles of various sizes spread over lower Manhattan and Brooklyn, for many miles. Fire fighters and medics working at the WTC were exposed, but also men and women on the streets and in nearby buildings, and children in nearby schools. In vivo inhalation studies and epidemiological studies pointed out the impact of the dust cloud. Health effects from inhaling dust included bronchial hyper reactivity, because of the high alkalinity of dust particles. Other possible health effects include coughs, an increased risk of asthma and a two-fold increase in the number of small-for-gestational-age baby’s among pregnant women present in or nearby the Twin Towers at the time of the attack. After September, airborne pollutant concentrations in nearby communities declined.
Many people present at the WTC at the time of the attacks are still checked regularly, because long-term effects may eventually show. It is thought there may be an increased risk of development of mesothelioma, consequential to exposure to asbestos. This is a disease where malignant cells develop in the protective cover of the body’s organs. Airborne dioxins in the days and weeks after the attack may increase the risk of cancer and diabetes. Infants of women that were pregnant on September 11 and had been in the vicinity of the WTC at the time of the attack are also checked for growth or developmental problems.
Asia
Afghanistan war – In October 2001, the United States attacked Afghanistan as a starting chapter of the ‘War on terrorism’, which still continues today. The ultimate goal was to replace the Taliban government, and to find apparent 9/11 mastermind and Al-Qaeda member Osama Bin Laden. Many European countries assisted the US in what was called ‘Operation Enduring Freedom’.
During the war, extensive damage was done to the environment, and many people suffered health effects from weapons applied to destroy enemy targets. It is estimated that ten thousand villages, and their surrounding environments were destroyed. Safe drinking water declined, because of a destruction of water infrastructure and resulting leaks, bacterial contamination and water theft. Rivers and groundwater were contaminated by poorly constructed landfills located near the sources.
Afghanistan once consisted of major forests watered by monsoons. During the war, Taliban members illegally trading timber in Pakistan destroyed much of the forest cover. US bombings and refugees in need of firewood destroyed much of what remained. Less than 2% of the country still contains a forest cover today.
Bombs threaten much of the country’s wildlife. One the world’s important migratory thoroughfare leads through Afghanistan. The number of birds now flying this route has dropped by 85%. In the mountains many large animals such as leopards found refuge, but much of the habitat is applied as refuge for military forces now. Additionally, refugees capture leopards and other large animals are and trade them for safe passage across the border.
Pollution from application of explosives entered air, soil and water. One example is cyclonite, a toxic substance that may cause cancer. Rocket propellants deposited perchlorates, which damage the thyroid gland. Numerous landmines left behind in Afghan soils still cause the deaths of men, women and children today.
Cambodia civil war – In 1966 the Prince of Cambodia began to lose the faith of many for failure to come to grips with the deteriorating economic situation. In 1967 rebellion started in a wealthy province where many large landowners lives. Villagers began attacking the tax collection brigade, because taxes were invested in building large factories, causing land to be taken. This led to a bloody civil war. Before the conflict could be repressed 10,000 people had died.
The rebellion caused the up rise of the Khmer Rouge, a Maoist-extremist organization that wanted to introduce communism in the country. In 1975 the organization, led by Pol Pot, officially seized power in Cambodia. The Khmer considered farmers (proletarians) to be the working class, as did Mao in China earlier. Schools, hospitals and banks were closed, the country was isolated from all foreign influence, and people were moved to the countryside for forced labor. People were obligated to work up to 12 hours a day, growing three times as many crops, as was usually the case. Many people died there from exhaustion, illness and starvation, or where shot by the Khmer on what was known as ‘The Killing Fields’.
The Khmer Rouge regime resulted in deforestation, caused by extensive timber logging to finance war efforts, agricultural clearance, construction, logging concessions and collection of wood fuels. A total 35% of the Cambodian forest cover was lost under the Maoist regime. Deforestation resulted in severe floods, damaging rice crops and causing food shortages. In 1993, a ban on logging exports was introduced to prevent further flooding damage.
In 1979 the Khmer Rouge regime ended with an invasion by Vietnam, and the installation of a pro-Vietnamese puppet government. Subsequently, Thai and Chinese forces attempted to liberate the country from Vietnamese dominance. Many landmines were placed in the 1980’s, and are still present in the countryside. They deny agricultural use of the land where they are placed. In 1992 free elections were introduced, but the Khmer Rouge resumed fighting. Eventually, half of the Khmer soldiers left in 1996, and many officials were captured. Under the Khmer regime, a total of 1.7 million people died, and the Khmer was directly responsible for about 750,000 of those casualties.
Hiroshima & Nagasaki nuclear explosions – Atomic bombs are based on the principle of nuclear fission, which was discovered in Nazi Germany in 1938 by two radio chemists. During the process, atoms are split and energy is released in the form of heat. Controlled reactions are applied in nuclear power plants for production of electricity, whereas unchecked reactions occur during nuclear bombings. The invention in Germany alarmed people in the United States, because the Nazi’s in possession of atomics bombs would be much more dangerous than they already where. When America became involved in WWII, the development of atomic bombs started there in what was called the ‘Manhattan Project’. In July 1945 an atomic bomb was tested in the New Mexico desert. The tests were considered a success, and America was now in possession of one of the world’s deadliest weapons.
In 1945, at the end of World War II and the beginning of the Cold War, nuclear weapons were applied to kill for the first time in Japan. On August 6, a uranium bomb by the name of Little Boy was dropped on Hiroshima, followed by a plutonium bomb by the name of Fat Man on Nagasaki on August 9. The reason Hiroshima was picked was that it was a major military centre. The bomb detonated at 8.15 p.m. over a Japanese Army parade field, where soldiers were already present. Nagasaki was picked because it was an industrial centre. The bomb, which was much larger than that used on Hiroshima, exploded at 11.02 a.m. at an industrial site. However, the hills on and the geographical location of the bombing site caused the eventual impact to be smaller than days earlier in Hiroshima.
The first impact of the atomic bombings was a blinding light, accompanied by a giant wave of heat. Dry flammable materials caught fire, and all men and animals within half a mile from the explosion sites died instantly. Many structures collapsed, in Nagasaki even the structures designed to survive earthquakes were blasted away. Many water lines broke. Fires could not be extinguished because of the water shortage, and six weeks after the blast the city still suffered from a lack of water. In Hiroshima a number of small fires combined with wind formed a firestorm, killing those who did not die before but were left immobile for some reason. Within days after the blasts, radiation sickness started rearing its ugly head, and many more people would die from it within the next 5 years.
The total estimated death toll:
In Hiroshima 100,000 were killed instantly, and between 100,000 and 200,000 died eventually.
In Nagasaki about 40,000 were killed instantly, and between 70,000 and 150,000 died eventually.
The events of August 6 and August 9 can be translated into environmental effects more literally. The blasts caused air pollution from dust particles and radioactive debris flying around, and from the fires burning everywhere. Many plants and animals were killed in the blast, or died moments to months later from radioactive precipitation. Radioactive sand clogged wells used for drinking water winning, thereby causing a drinking water problem that could not easily be solved. Surface water sources were polluted, particularly by radioactive waste. Agricultural production was damaged; dead stalks of rice could be found up to seven miles from ground zero. In Hiroshima the impact of the bombing was noticeable within a 10 km radius around the city, and in Nagasaki within a 1 km radius.
Iraq & Kuwait – The Gulf War was fought between Iraq, Kuwait and a number of western countries in 1991. Kuwait had been part of Iraq in the past, but was liberated by British imperialism, as the Iraqi government described it. In August 1990, Iraqi forces claimed that the country was illegally extracting oil from Iraqi territory, and attacked. The United Nations attempted to liberate Kuwait. Starting January 1991, Operation Desert Storm began, with the purpose of destroying Iraqi air force and anti-aircraft facilities, and command and control facilities. The battle was fought in Iraq, Kuwait and the Saudi-Arabian border region. Both aerial and ground artillery was applied. Late January, Iraqi aircraft were flown to Iran, and Iraqi forces began to flee.
The Gulf War was one of the most environmentally devastating wars ever fought. Iraq dumped approximately one million tons of crude oil into the Persian Gulf, thereby causing the largest oil spill in history (see environmental disasters). Approximately 25,000 migratory birds were killed. The impact on marine life was not as severe as expected, because warm water sped up the natural breakdown of oil. Local prawn fisheries did experience problems after the war. Crude oil was also spilled into the desert, forming oil lakes covering 50 square kilometres. In due time the oil percolated into groundwater aquifers.
Fleeing Iraqi troops ignited Kuwaiti oil sources, releasing half a ton of air pollutants into the atmosphere. Environmental problems caused by the oil fires include smog formation and acid rain. Toxic fumes originating from the burning oil wells compromised human health, and threatened wildlife. A soot layer was deposited on the desert, covering plants, and thereby preventing them from breathing. Seawater was applied to extinguish the oil fires, resulting in increased salinity in areas close to oil wells. It took about nine months to extinguish the fires.
During the war, many dams and sewage water treatment plants were targeted and destroyed. A lack of possibilities for water treatment resulting from the attacks caused sewage to flow directly into the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. Additionally, pollutants seeped from bombed chemical plants into the rivers. Drinking water extracted from the river was polluted, resulting in widespread disease. For example, cases of typhoid fever have increased tenfold since 1991.
Movement of heavy machinery such as tanks through the desert damaged the brittle surface, causing soil erosion. Sand was uncovered that formed gradually moving sand dunes. These dunes may one day cause problems for Kuwait City. Tanks fired Depleted Uranium (DU) missiles, which can puncture heavy artillery structures. DU is a heavy metal that causes kidney damage and is suspected to be teratogenic and carcinogenic. Post-Gulf War reports state an increase in birth defects for children born to veterans. The impact of Depleted Uranium could not be thoroughly investigated after the Gulf War, because Saddam Hussein refused to cooperate. Its true properties were revealed after the Kosovo War in 2001 (description below). DU has now been identified as a neurotoxin, and birth defects and cancers are attributed to other chemical and nerve agents. However, it is stated that DU oxides deposited in the lungs of veterans have not been thoroughly researched yet. It was later found that this may cause kidney and lung infections for highly exposed persons.
After the Gulf War many veterans suffered from a condition now known as the Gulf War Syndrome. The causes of the illness are subject to widespread speculation. Examples of possible causes are exposure to DU (see above), chemical weapons (nerve gas and mustard gas), an anthrax vaccine given to 41% of US soldiers and 60-75% of UK soldiers, smoke from burning oil wells and parasites. Symptoms of the GWS included chronic fatigue, muscle problems, diarrhoea, migraine, memory loss, skin problems and shortness of breath. Many Gulf War veterans have died of illnesses such as brain cancer, now acknowledged as potentially connected to service during the war.
Iraq & the United States – The war in Iraq started by the United States in 2003 as part of the War on Terrorism causes poverty, resulting in environmental problems. Long-term environmental effects of the war remain unclear, but short-term problems have been identified for every environmental compartment. For example, some weapons are applied that may be extremely damaging to the environment, such as white phosphorus ammunition. People around the world protest the application of such armoury.
Water
Damage to sanitation structures by frequent bombing, and damage to sewage treatment systems by power blackouts cause pollution of the River Tigris. Two hundred blue plastic containers containing uranium were stolen from a nuclear power plant located south of Baghdad. The radioactive content of the barrels was dumped in rivers and the barrels were rinsed out. Poor people applied the containers as storage facility for water, oil and tomatoes, or sold them to others. Milk was transported to other regions in the barrels, making it almost impossible to relocate them.
Air
Oil trenches are burning, as was the case in the Gulf War of 1991, resulting in air pollution. In Northern Iraq, a sulphur plant burned for one month, contributing to air pollution. As fires continue burning, groundwater applied as a drinking water source may be polluted.
Soil
Military movements and weapon application result in land degradation. The destruction of military and industrial machinery releases heavy metals and other harmful substances.

Israel & Lebanon – In July 2006, Hezbollah initiated a rocket attack on Israeli borders. A ground patrol killed and captured Israeli soldiers. This resulted in open war between Israel and Lebanon.
The war caused environmental problems as Israelis bombed a power station south of Beirut. Damaged storage tanks leaked an estimated 20,000 tons of oil into the Mediterranean Sea. The oil spill spread rapidly, covering over 90 km of the coastline, killing fish and affecting the habitat of the endangered green sea turtle. A sludge layer covers Beaches across Lebanon, and the same problem may occur in Syria as the spill continues to spread. Part of the oil spill burned, causing widespread air pollution. Smog affects the health of people living in the city of Beirut. So far problems limiting the clean-up operation of oil spills have occurred, because of ongoing violence in the region.
Another major problem were forest fires in Northern Israel caused by Hezbollah bombings. A total of 9,000 acres of forest burned to the ground, and fires threaten tree reserves and bird sanctuaries.
Russia & Chechnya – In 1994 the First Chechen War of independence started, between Russian troops, Chechen guerrilla fighters and civilians. Chechnya has been a province of Russia for a very long time and now desires independence. The First War ended in 1996, but in 1999 Russia again attacked Chechnya for purposes of oil distribution.
The war between the country and its province continues today. It has devastating effects on the region of Chechnya. An estimated 30% of Chechen territory is contaminated, and 40% of the territory does not meet environmental standards for life. Major environmental problems include radioactive waste and radiation, oil leaks into the ground from bombarded plants and refineries, and pollution of soil and surface water. Russia has buried radioactive waste in Chechnya. Radiation at some sites is ten times its normal level. Radiation risks increase as Russia bombs the locations, particularly because after 1999 the severeness of weaponry increased. A major part of agricultural land is polluted to the extent that it can no longer meet food supplies. This was mainly caused by unprofessional mini-refineries of oil poachers in their backyards, not meeting official standards and causing over 50% of the product to be lost as waste. Groundwater pollution flows into the rivers Sunzha and Terek on a daily basis. On some locations the rivers are totally devoid of fish. Flora and fauna are destroyed by oil leaks and bombings.
Vietnam war – The Vietnam War started in 1945 and ended in 1975. It is now entitled a proxy war, fought during the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union to prevent the necessity for the nations to fight each other directly. North Vietnam fought side by side with the Soviet Union and China, and South Vietnam with the United States, New Zealand and South Korea. It must be noted that the United States only started to be actively involved in the battle after 1963. Between 1965 and 1968 North Vietnam was bombed under Operation Rolling Thunder, in order to force the enemy to negotiate. Bombs destroyed over two million acres of land. North Vietnam forces began to strike back, and the Soviet Union delivered anti-aircraft missiles to North Vietnam. The ground war of US troops against the Viet Cong began. The United States would not retreat from Vietnam until 1973, and during those years extremely environmentally damaging weapons and war tactics were applied.
A massive herbicidal programme was carried out, in order to break the forest cover sheltering Viet Cong guerrillas, and deprive Vietnamese peasants of food. The spraying destroyed 14% of Vietnam’s forests, diminished agricultural yield, and made seeds unfit for replanting. If agricultural yield was not damaged by herbicides, it was often lost because military on the ground set fire to haystacks, and soaked land with aviation fuel en burned it. A total of 15,000 square kilometres of land were eventually destroyed. Livestock was often shot, to deprive peasant of their entire food supply. A total of 13,000 livestock were killed during the war.
The application of 72 million litres of chemical spray resulted in the death of many animals, and caused health effects with humans. One chemical that was applied between 1962 and 1971, called Agent Orange, was particularly harmful. Its main constituent is dioxin, which was present in soil, water and vegetation during and after the war. Dioxin is carcinogenic and teratogenic, and has resulted in spontaneous abortions, chloracne, skin and lung cancers, lower intelligence and emotional problems among children. Children fathered by men exposed to Agent Orange during the Vietnam War often have congenital abnormalities. An estimated half a million children were born with dioxin-related abnormalities. Agent Orange continues to threaten the health of the Vietnamese today.
""Drafted to go to Vietnam
To fight communism in a foreign land.
To preserve democracy is my plight
Which is a God...Given...Right.
Greenery so thick with hidden enemies
Agent Orange is sprayed on the trees.
Covering me from head to toe
Irate my eyes, burns through my clothes.
Returned home when my tour was done
To be told ""You have cancer, son"".
Agent Orange is to blame
Government caused your suffering and pain.
Fight for compensation is frustrating and slow
Brass cover-up, not wanting anyone to know.
From cancer many comrades have died
Medical Insurance have been denied.
Compensation I now receive
My health I hope to retrieve.
In Vietnam , I was spared my life
Just to be stabbed with an Agent Orange knife"" Yvonne Legge, 2001
Today, agriculture in Vietnam continues to suffer problems from six million unexploded bombs still present. Several organisations are attempting to remove these bombs. Landmines left in Vietnam are not removed, because the Vietnamese government refuses to accept responsibility.
Europe
Kosovo war – The Kosovo war can be divided up in two separate parts: a conflict between Serbia and Kosovo, and a conflict between Kosovo and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO). The first conflict originated in 1996 from the statement of Slobodan Milocevic that Kosovo was to remain a part of Serbia, and from the resulting violent response of Albanian residents. When Serbian troops slaughtered 45 Albanians in the village of Racak in Kosovo in 1999, the NATO intervened. NATO launched a 4-month bombing campaign upon Serbia as a reply to the massacre at Racak.
The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) investigated the environmental impact of the Kosovo war. It was concluded that the war did not result in an environmental disaster affecting the entire Balkan region. Nevertheless, some environmental hot spots were identified, namely Belgrade, Pancevo, Kragujevac, Novi Sad and Bor.
Bombings carried out by the United States resulted in leakages in oil refineries and oil storage depots. Industrial sites containing other industries were also targeted. EDC (1,2-dichloroethane), PCBs en mercury escaped to the environment. Burning of Vinyl Chloride Monomer (VCM) resulted in the formation of dioxin, hydrochloric acid, carbon monoxide and PAHs, and oil burning released sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, lead and PAHs into the air. Heavy clouds of black smoke forming over burning industrial targets caused black rain to fall on the area around Pancevo. Some damage was done to National Parks in Serbia by bombings, and therefore to biodiversity. EDC, mercury and petroleum products (e.g. PCBs) polluted the Danube River. These are present in the sediments and may resurface in due time. EDC is toxic to both terrestrial and aquatic life. Mercury may be converted into methyl mercury, which is very toxic and bio accumulates. As a measure to prevent the consequences of bombing, a fertilizer plant in Pancevo released liquid ammonia into the Danube River. This caused fish kills up to 30 kilometres downstream.
In 1999 when NATO bombed Belgrade, the capital of Serbia, the resulting environmental damage was enormous. Petrochemical plants in suburbs started leaking all kinds of hazardous chemicals into air, water and soil. Factories producing ammonia and plastics released chlorine, hydrochloric acid, vinyl chloride and other chlorine substances, resulting in local air pollution and health problems. Water sources were polluted by oil leaking from refineries. The Danube River was polluted by oil more severely, but this time hydrochloric acid and mercury compounds also ended up there. These remained in the water for a considering period of time and consequently ended up in neighbouring countries Rumania and Bulgaria.
Clean drinking water supplies and waste treatment plants were damaged by NATO bombings. Many people fled their houses and were moved to refugee camps, where the number of people grew rapidly. A lack of clean drinking water and sanitation problems occurred.
Like in the Gulf War, Depleted Uranium (DU) was applied in the Kosovo War to puncture tanks and other artillery. After the war, the United Kingdom assisted in the removal of DU residues from the environment. Veterans complained of health effects. It was acknowledged by the UK and the US that dusts from DU can be dangerous if inhaled. Inhalation of dust most likely results in chemical poisoning.
World War I: Trench Warfare – In 1914, the assassination of archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria-Hungary resulted in the First World War, otherwise known as The Great War, or WWI. It started with Austria-Hungary invading Serbia, where the assassin came from, and Germany invading Belgium. The war was mostly in Europe, between the Allies and the Central Powers.
Allies: France, United Kingdom, Italy, Belgium, Luxembourg, Russia, Poland, Serbia, Montenegro, Rumania, Albania, Greece, Portugal, Finland, United States, Canada, Brazil, Armenia, Australia, India, New Zealand, South Africa, Liberia, China, Japan, Thailand, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama
Central Powers: Austria-Hungary, Germany, Turkish Empire, and Bulgaria
The war was fought from trenches, dug from the North Sea to the border of Switzerland. In 1918 when the war was over, empires disintegrated into smaller countries, marking the division of Europe today. Over 9 million people had died, most of which perished from influenza after the outbreak of the Spanish Flu (see environmental disasters). The war did not directly cause the influenza outbreak, but it was amplified. Mass movement of troops and close quarters caused the Spanish Flu to spread quickly. Furthermore, stresses of war may have increased the susceptibility of soldiers to the disease.
In terms of environmental impact, World War I was most damaging, because of landscape changes caused by trench warfare. Digging trenches caused trampling of grassland, crushing of plants and animals, and churning of soil. Erosion resulted from forest logging to expand the network of trenches. Soil structures were altered severely, and if the war was never fought, in all likelihood the landscape would have looked very differently today.
Another damaging impact was the application of poison gas. Gases were spread throughout the trenches to kill soldiers of the opposite front. Examples of gases applied during WWI are tear gas (aerosols causing eye irritation), mustard gas (cell toxic gas causing blistering and bleeding), and carbonyl chloride (carcinogenic gas). The gases caused a total of 100,000 deaths, most caused by carbonyl chloride (phosgene). Battlefields were polluted, and most of the gas evaporates into the atmosphere. After the war, unexploded ammunition caused major problems in former battle areas. Environmental legislation prohibits detonation or dumping chemical weapons at sea, therefore the cleanup was and still remains a costly operation. In 1925, most WWI participants signed a treaty banning the application of gaseous chemical weapons. Chemical disarmament plants are planned in France and Belgium.
World War II: Gas Chambers – World War II was a worldwide conflict, fought between the Allies (Britain, France and the United States as its core countries) and the Axis Powers (Germany, Italy and Japan as its core countries). It started with the German invasion of Poland and Czechoslovakia in 1939, and ended with the liberation of Western Europe by the allies in 1945.
Between 1941 and 1945, over 1 million people were killed in the gas chambers of the extermination camp Auschwitz-Birkenau in Nazi Germany. Over 90% of the victims were Jews, and the other 10% consisted of Poles, Soviet prisoners of war and gypsies. The substance applied was Zyklon-B, a cyanide-based insecticide that is lethal to humans in large doses. It was stored as crystals in closed containers, but when exposed to air it released the lethal hydrogen cyanide gas (HCN). As Zyklon-B was poured into the gas chambers through small openings, it took only 10-15 minutes to kill all people inside.
The insecticide was supplied to Nazi Germany by two firms, Tesch-Stabenow and Degesh. After the war the firms claimed they were unaware of the application of the product to kill people in large numbers. However, it was later stated that the company had to have known, because they supplied enough substance to kill 2 million people, and additionally gave some advise on how to use the ventilating and heating equipment.
World War II: Hunger winter – In late 1944, the allied troops attempted to liberate Western Europe. As they reached The Netherlands, German resistance caused the liberation to be halted in Arnhem, as allied troops failed to occupy a bridge over the River Rhine. As the Dutch government in exile in Britain called for railway strikes, the Germans responded by putting embargo on food transport to the west. This resulted in what is now known as the Hunger Winter, causing an estimated 20,000-25,000 Dutch to starve to death. A number of factors caused the starvation: a harsh winter, fuel shortages, the ruin of agricultural land by bombings, floods, and the food transport embargo. Most people in the west lived off tulip bulbs and sugar beet. Official food rations were below 1000 cal per person per day. In May 1945 the Hunger Winter ended with the official liberation of the west of The Netherlands.

Fossil fuel producers in the U.S. are directly benefiting from implicit subsidies on the order of $62 billion a year because of inefficient pricing that doesn’t properly account for the costs of damages to the environment, climate, and human health. . About the EPI
The 2020 Environmental Performance Index (EPI) provides a data-driven summary of the state of sustainability around the world. Using 32 performance indicators across 11 issue categories, the EPI ranks 180 countries on environmental health and ecosystem vitality. These indicators provide a gauge at a national scale of how close countries are to established environmental policy targets. The EPI offers a scorecard that highlights leaders and laggards in environmental performance and provides practical guidance for countries that aspire to move toward a sustainable future.
EPI indicators provide a way to spot problems, set targets, track trends, understand outcomes, and identify best policy practices. Good data and fact-based analysis can also help government officials refine their policy agendas, facilitate communications with key stakeholders, and maximize the return on environmental investments. The EPI offers a powerful policy tool in support of efforts to meet the targets of the UN Sustainable Development Goals and to move society toward a sustainable future.
Overall EPI rankings indicate which countries are best addressing the environmental challenges that every nation faces. Going beyond the aggregate scores and drilling down into the data to analyze performance by issue category, policy objective, peer group, and country offers even greater value for policymakers. This granular view and comparative perspective can assist in understanding the determinants of environmental progress and in refining policy choices.
Funding from the The McCall MacBain Foundation of Canada supports the EPI work at both Yale and Columbia. The EPI research team is deeply grateful for this generous support.
Explaining performance
A number of striking conclusions emerge from the 2020 EPI rankings and indicators. First, good policy results are associated with wealth (GDP per capita), meaning that economic prosperity makes it possible for nations to invest in policies and programs that lead to desirable outcomes. This trend is especially true for issue categories under the umbrella of environmental health, as building the necessary infrastructure to provide clean drinking water and sanitation, reduce ambient air pollution, control hazardous waste, and respond to public health crises yields large returns for human well-being.
Second, the pursuit of economic prosperity – manifested in industrialization and urbanization – often means more pollution and other strains on ecosystem vitality, especially in the developing world, where air and water emissions remain significant. But at the same time, the data suggest countries need not sacrifice sustainability for economic security or vice versa. In every issue category, we find countries that rise above their economic peers. Policymakers and other stakeholders in these leading countries demonstrate that focused attention can mobilize communities to protect natural resources and human well-being despite the strains associated with economic growth. In this regard, indicators of good governance – including commitment to the rule of law, a vibrant press, and even-handed enforcement of regulations – have strong relationships with top-tier EPI scores.

In this regard, indicators of good governance – including commitment to the rule of law, a vibrant press, and even-handed enforcement of regulations – have strong relationships with top-tier EPI scores.
Third, while top EPI performers pay attention to all areas of sustainability, their lagging peers tend to have uneven performance. Denmark, which ranks #1, has strong results across most issues and with leading-edge commitments and outcomes with regard to climate change mitigation. In general, high scorers exhibit long-standing policies and programs to protect public health, preserve natural resources, and decrease greenhouse gas emissions. The data further suggest that countries making concerted efforts to decarbonize their electricity sectors have made the greatest gains in combating climate change, with associated benefits for ecosystems and human health. We note, however, that every country – including those at the top of the EPI rankings – still has issues to improve upon. No country can claim to be on a fully sustainable trajectory.

Fourth, laggards must redouble national sustainability efforts along all fronts. A number of important countries in the Global South, including India and Nigeria, come out near the bottom of the rankings. Their low EPI scores indicate the need for greater attention to the spectrum of sustainability requirements, with a high-priority focus on critical issues such as air and water quality, biodiversity, and climate change. Some of the other laggards, including Nepal and Afghanistan, face broader challenges such as civil unrest, and their low scores can almost all be attributed to weak governance.

Refining metrics
Innovations in the 2020 EPI data and methodology reflect the latest advances in environmental science and indicator analysis. Notably, the 2020 rankings include for the first time a waste management metric and a pilot indicator on CO2 emissions from land cover change. Other new indicators deepen the analysis of air quality, biodiversity & habitat, fisheries, ecosystem services, and climate change. Full documentation of the methodology is available on this website, and the EPI team invites feedback and suggestions for strengthening future versions of the Index.
While the EPI provides a framework for greater analytic rigor in policymaking, it also reveals a number of severe data gaps that limit the analytic scope of the rankings. As the EPI project has highlighted for two decades, better data collection, reporting, and verification across a range of environmental issues are urgently needed. The existing gaps are especially pronounced in the areas of agriculture, water resources, and threats to biodiversity. New investments in stronger global data systems are essential to better manage sustainability challenges and to ensure that the global community does not breach fundamental planetary boundaries.

The inability to capture transboundary environmental impacts persists as a limitation of the current EPI framework. While the current methodology reveals important insights into how countries perform within their own borders, it does not account for “exported” impacts associated with imported products. With groundbreaking models and new datasets emerging, the EPI team has been working to produce new metrics that account for the spillovers of harm associated with traded goods in an interconnected world.

Global pandemic
The 2020 EPI emerges in the midst of the COVID-19 crisis that has challenged public health systems and disrupted economic activity across the world. The global pandemic has made clear the profound interdependence of all nations and the importance of investing in resilience. Unintended consequences of the economic shutdown in many nations include a sharp drop in pollution levels and the return of wildlife. The EPI team hopes that this unexpected glimpse of what a sustainable planet might look like from an ecological perspective – albeit at a terrible price in terms of public health and economic damage – will inspire the policy transformation required for a sustainable future that is both economically vigorous and environmentally sound.
Policy Objectives in the 2020 EPI
The relationship between 2020 EPI Score and GDP per capita shows a strong positive correlation, although many countries out- or underperform their economic peers. . ",False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False

Background
The quality of our local living environment has a direct impact on our health and well-being. An unspoiled environment is a source of satisfaction, improves mental well-being, allows people to recover from the stress of everyday life and to perform physical activity. Having access to green spaces for example, is an essential part of quality of life. Also, our economies rely not only on healthy and productive workers but also on natural resources such as water, timber, fisheries, plants and crops. Protecting our environment and natural resources therefore remains a long-term priority for both our generation and those to come. Each country in the OECD has its own unique environmental concerns, due to differences in consumption, air and water pollution, climate, industry, and trade. But countries also need to work together as certain environmental problems, like climate change and ozone destruction, do not respect national borders.
Air pollution
Outdoor air pollution is one important environmental issue that directly affects the quality of people's lives. Despite national and international interventions and decreases in major pollutant emissions, globally the health impacts of urban air pollution continue to worsen, with air pollution set to become the top environmental cause of premature mortality by 2050. Air pollution in urban centres, often caused by transport and the use of small-scale burning of wood or coal, is linked to a range of health problems, from minor eye irritation to upper respiratory symptoms in the short term and chronic respiratory diseases such as asthma, cardiovascular diseases and lung cancer in the long term. Some of these complications require hospital treatment, and may be fatal. Children and the elderly may be particularly vulnerable.
PM2.5 – tiny particulate matter small enough to be inhaled into the deepest part of the lung – is monitored in OECD countries because it can harm human health and reduce life expectancy. In several OECD countries the share of the population exposed to PM2.5 has dropped. However, in about half of the countries, more than 90% of the population is still exposed to concentrations above the World Health Organization guideline limit of 10 micrograms per cubic meter. On average, PM2.5 concentrations are at around 13.9 micrograms per cubic meter in OECD countries.The OECD Environmental Outlook to 2050 projects the number of premature deaths associated with exposure to PM10 and PM2.5 to increase from just over 1 million worldwide in 2000 to about 3.5 million in 2050.
Water Quality
Access to clean water is fundamental to human well-being. Managing water to meet that need is a major – and growing – challenge in many parts of the world. Many people are suffering from inadequate quantity and quality of water. Despite significant progress in OECD countries in reducing water pollution, from fixed sources such as industrial and municipal wastewater treatment plants, diffuse pollution from agriculture and urban run-offs remains a challenge, and improvements in freshwater quality are not always easy to discern. On average, almost 81% of people in OECD countries say they are satisfied with water quality.

Green communities
Shortcomings in infrastructure quality and delivery disproportionately affect the poor and rural populations. Poor infrastructure raises the costs (""poverty premium"") of supplying products to low-income and ""difficult-to-reach"" neighbourhoods, ultimately increasing the prices charged for those products.
Tedcoris a grassroots company that brings waste management to underserved communities. It provides informal workers and disadvantaged entrepreneurs with training to provide effective waste management. Tedcor obtains waste treatment contracts with municipalities and subcontracts tasks to these small businesses. The company thus ensures regular demand for the entrepreneurs' services. This business model lowers the overall cost of the waste management services, meaning that waste collection services can be extended to previously underserved areas.

Reducing agricultural emissions
The government has made considerable efforts to reduce the carbon footprint of the agricultural sector. The Emissions Reduction Fund operates across the economy, also covering the agricultural sector. The Fund incentivises companies to adopt smarter practices to cut the amount of greenhouse gases they create and credits companies for emissions reductions. Companies with projects capable of achieving maximum abatement at the lowest cost receive funding after a bidding process. Successful bidders then enter contracts with the government outlining the quantity and price of the carbon credits. Funding is not provided to the companies until after the abatement is delivered to ensure compliance with the agreement.

Adapting to climate change in the Alps
The Alps are particularly sensitive to climate change. Warming since pre-industrial times in the European Alpine Region has been two and a half times the global average. Austria's tourism income accounts for 4.5% of the national economy, and half of that is from winter tourism. With climate change, the natural snow-reliability of the Austrian ski areas will decrease substantially.
The Austrian ski industry is already investing heavily in measures to increase the reliability of its ski runs. The primary tool has been the use of snow machines to provide adequate cover. However, as temperatures (or humidity, or both) increase, so do the volumes of water and energy required, and the costs. Ultimately, rising temperatures could increasingly disadvantage Austrian ski slopes relative to Alpine countries with access to higher slopes, though opportunities may arise from increased summer tourism.

Forest conservation
Brazil's recent experience in forest conservation is encouraging. Brazil has globally achieved the largest slowdown in annual forest losses, which fell from a high of 27 000 km2 in 2004 to under 5 000 km2 in 2014. This slowdown has been achieved with systematic use of satellite data for monitoring illegal logging, as well as better enforcement, combined with incentive-based measures such as credit restrictions to violators of environmental law. A significant expansion of protected areas has been crucial in fighting deforestation. The Amazon Region Protected Areas programme (ARPA) is one of the largest tropical forest conservation programmes in the world. To date it has established more than 500 000 km2 of protected areas in the Amazon.
Notwithstanding, deforestation remains a challenge in Brazil. Overall, total forest area has decreased by about 5% since 2000, and an area of forest equal to the size of Slovenia (or the Brazilian state of Sergipe) is still lost every four years. Pressures remain high in ecosystems outside the Amazon, especially in the tropical savannah (Cerrado), for which the government has recently launched a dedicated deforestation control plan.
Co-ordinating efforts to improve water management
Brazil introduced the National Water Management Pact to better manage regional disparities in water availability and institutional capacity for water management. The Pact proposes the implementation of co-operation contractual agreements between the National Water Agency and state-level water organisations.
The Pact relies on states’ self-assessment to set their own levels of ambition. This ensures that participating states maintain autonomy in managing their water resources. Each participating state sets its own targets to establish or improve water management procedures and instruments. States receive funding, technical and institutional support to help them reach their targets. The federal funding is contingent on the existence of state and river basin water resource plans, with targets, as well as the allocation of staff resources for implementation.
All states have shown interest in the pact and 24 out of 27 states have already signed on. Improvements include enhanced co-operation at the state level and within the National Water Agency; capacity development; and wide acceptance of the programme. The pact has also helped states save time and money as shared knowledge reduces the duplication of efforts.

Protecting the Great Lakes
Ontario's Great Lakes Strategy responds to public concerns about the deteriorating condition of the Great Lakes ecosystems. The Strategy consists of a multi-level engagement process which includes provincial ministries, municipalities, non-governmental organisation, industrial and commercial sectors, and First Nations and Métis communities. Stakeholders can influence the development of legally enforceable policies through this involvement with advisory committees.
The Lake Simcoe Protection Act and Lake Simcoe Protection Plan were established under the Great Lakes Strategy. This engagement process has been a good mechanism to set policy direction and implement solutions to complex environmental challenges. The resulting Protection Plan sets a target to reduce phosphorus by 40% to restore the cold water fishery. In support of the Great Lakes Protection Act, environmental NGOs formed the Great Lakes Alliance, which replicates the Lake Simcoe approach to stakeholder involvement in decision making.
Phasing out existing coal-fired electricity generation
Federal government regulations took effect on 1 July 2015, requiring that new coal-fired power plants, and existing coal-fired generation units nearing the end of their useful life, bring emissions intensity below the level of a natural gas combined cycle plant. Existing ""end of life"" coal units must either be shut down or retrofitted with carbon capture and storage (CCS). The 50-year lifetime allowed under this regulation is somewhat long; the government expects the regulation to force closure of 20 coal units by 2030, but 16 of these shutdowns would occur after 2025. If a shorter lifetime were applied this type of policy could be used to drive accelerated ""unlocking"" of existing coal-fired generation assets (e.g., through retirement, retrofit, or conversion).
Indeed, the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Alberta, which together accounted for around 75% of Canada’s coal-fired capacity in 2010, have moved forward with more ambitious policies. Ontario completed a phase out of coal-fired electricity generation in April, 2014, shutting down three coal-fired generation stations (Lakeview, Nanticoke and Lambton) and converting two others to biomass (Atikokan and Thunder Bay). In 2015 the province of Alberta announced a phase-out of coal-fired generation by 2030, although under the federal regulations six of the 18 affected coal units could have continued operating beyond 2030. Beyond their climate benefits, these phase-outs of coal-fired electricity generation will yield positive impacts on air quality and health.

Despite national and international interventions and decreases in major pollutant emissions, the health impacts of urban air pollution continue to worsen, with air pollution set to become the top environmental cause of premature mortality globally by 2050. Air pollution in urban centres, often caused by transport and the use of small-scale burning of wood or coal, is linked to a range of health problems, from minor eye irritation to upper respiratory symptoms in the short-term and chronic respiratory diseases such as asthma, cardiovascular diseases and lung cancer in the long-term. Children and the elderly may be particularly vulnerable.

Green growth
Chile's Green Growth Strategy promotes economic growth while preventing further environmental deterioration. Though reliance on fossil fuels poses a challenge the renewable target of 20% by 2020 is on track. The government also aims to reduce CO2 emissions per unit of GDP by 30% relative to 2007 levels.
The government has since introduced several tax reforms to support emissions and renewable energy targets. A tax on vehicles is paid once based on the vehicle's emissions of nitrogen oxides and its selling price. Another tax on emissions from stationary sources of pollution will be implemented by 2017. This innovative tax includes a carbon tax at a rate of USD 5 per ton of CO2 and a tax on local pollutants.
Making wine production resiliant to climate change
Chile is vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, including increased flood risk, loss of biodiversity, reduced availability of water for hydropower and reduced agricultural production.
Production of grapes and wine, Chile’s most important export agricultural commodity, relies on water supply: 81% of vineyards are irrigated. Water stress would mean a fall in production and affect the country’s competitive position on the international wine market.
Chile established a certification system for sustainable wineries in 2012; 46 wineries are now certified and adopt practices to adapt to climate change and reduce their impact on biodiversity (e.g. use of compost instead of synthetic fertilisers, biological corridors for native trees and flowers, cover crops to prevent soil erosion and chickens as a natural form of pest control).

Bicycle city
The City of Copenhagen has, as do many other Danish towns, a long tradition for cycling policies, investing in dedicated cycle lanes and bridges. Copenhagen City has 346 km of dedicated cycling tracks and 48 000 bicycle parking spaces throughout the city. 35% of Copenhagen residents cycle to work or education regularly. Around 55 % of all school children in Copenhagen cycle to school on a regular basis. Currently, more than 1.2 million km are covered by cyclists in Copenhagen every day. Copenhagen has developed a new dedicated bicycling strategy, aiming by 2015 to have 50% of its citizens commuting by bicycle on a daily basis, as a contribution to the city’s climate strategy.
The most innovative policy initiative to facilitate this goal is to build ""cycle super highways"" for fast, long distance bike commuting, with few or no traffic lights. An 11 mile-long cycle superhighway between Copenhagen and Albertslund, a western suburb, is the first of 26 routes scheduled to be built, which are designed to encourage more people to commute to and from Copenhagen by bicycle. For the superhighway project, Copenhagen and 21 local governments teamed up to ensure that there were contiguous, standardised bike routes into the capital, across distances of up to 14 miles.
Another measure is that stoplight signals have been adjusted so that ""green waves"" at primary traffic routes now favour the cyclists' 20 km/h and not the car speed. As many as 93% of cyclists think Copenhagen is either a very good, good or satisfactory city in which to cycle. The cycle-friendly fame of Copenhagen has led to other city cycling initiative adopters such as New York naming their biking lanes ""Copenhagen lanes"". The cycling strategy also has significant economic gains for the city.

Tallinn is among recycling champions
Since 2008, Estonian municipalities have used EU and domestic funds to build about 100 collection points across the country for packaging, garden and park waste, household hazardous waste and electrical and electronic equipment. Tallinn’s scheme for recyclable waste has gone further, providing containers for such waste near residential buildings. As a result, Tallinn reached a separate collection rate of 53% of all municipal solid waste in 2012, the third highest among EU capital cities: 85% of glass and 74% of paper waste were collected. In Tallinn, biodegradable waste is also collected from apartment buildings, restaurants and food shops.

Tackling climate change
Finland, like other Nordic countries, has set climate change mitigation and green growth as strong priorities. The government is using a variety of instruments to promote energy efficiency, which supplement EU legislation. Energy taxes based on energy content, CO2 and particle emissions, have been increased progressively and are high by OECD standards. The share of renewable energy in overall energy production is about a third, one of the highest in the OECD, and Finland is likely to meet its ambitious target of 38% for renewable energy by 2020. The biofuel obligation will rise from the current 6% of transport fuels to 20% in 2020.
The government has identified EUR 2.7 billion-EUR 4.5 billion in production-linked subsidies which can heighten environmental pressures, mainly in energy, transport and agriculture. Such evaluation is very useful and should be followed by the phasing out of harmful subsidies where feasible, taking into consideration wider socio-economic and competitiveness effects.

Public transportation for lower carbon emissions
STIF, the organising transport authority for the Île-de-France, is a good example of how institutional co-ordination can advance low-carbon mobility goals. STIF defines operational and services level targets, set fares, and negotiate performance-based contracts with public service providers. They also develop an urban mobility plan which includes objectives and actions to help reach the national CO2 emissions mitigation target of a 20% reduction by 2020. By including stakeholders and the public, this framework has helped foster consensus over plans and develop coherence in projects implemented by different authorities. These efforts have helped increase the provision of public transport (measured by the number of trips) by 27% between 2000 and 2014.
Reducing air pollution in Paris
In 2014, over 2.3 million residents in Île-de-France were exposed to levels of fine particles and nitrogen dioxide above safe limits for human health. In 2015, the city of Paris adopted a plan to combat air pollution which included incentive measures to encourage use of public transport, subsidies to purchase electric bicycles and cars, and the extension of the bike lane network and 30 km/h zones. It also became the first city in France to test restricted traffic zones. Since 1 September 2015, vehicles of more than 3.5 tonnes identified as heavily polluting may not circulate in Paris between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. This ban will be extended progressively to other polluting vehicles according to a fixed schedule by 2020. Air quality will also improved through the reduction of the tax differential between diesel and petrol. The government plan to align the rates before 2022.
Reducing the use of pesticides by spreading good practices
The Dephy network of demonstration and experimentation farms tests, verifies, develops and rolls out agricultural techniques and systems for reducing the use of plant protection products.

Investing in clean transportation
Transport authorities manage provision, provide strategic planning and co-ordinate pricing across different modes of transport and different services providers. Frankfurt's Rhein-Main Transport Association influences policy and strategy beyond the borders of the municipality by bringing together three levels of government, 15 countries, 11 cities and the federal state of Hesse. To curb emissions caused by transportation the Association has invested in cleaner trains and introduced a fleet of hybrid buses.
Regulating air pollution
Small heating units using solid fuel such as woodburning stoves and wood-fired heating in households and small companies are a major source of emissions of harmful substances such as fine particles and polyaromatic hydrocarbons. In 2010, the government extended rules on such products to cover smaller units (from 4 kW to 1 MW of thermal power). The ordinance establishes emission limits for new installations, in line with best available technologies. It requires all existing stoves and boilers to be retrofitted with particulate filters or decommissioned by 2024 if emission standards cannot be met. Emission limits were tightened in 2015 to reflect technology development. Compliance with the limit values is established either by a manufacturer's certificate or by on-the-spot measurements. Installations and fuel quality are regularly checked.
The Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety (BMU) estimated that the 2010 ordinance would reduce particulate emissions to 16 000 tonnes by 2025 from some 24 000 in 2005, equivalent to about a 50% decline compared with the scenario without the revision.

Limiting potentially toxic gas emissions
The government has put a limit on the concentration levels of hydrogen sulphide (H2S) that is released in the atmosphere by geothermal power plants. This gas has an unpleasant odour, it is irritant to eyes and respiratory systems in low concentrations and toxic and corrosive in high concentrations. At 50 µg/m3, measured as an average over 24 hours, the daily limit is three times stricter than the WHO guideline value of 150 µg/m3. Exceeding the ambient standards triggers financial penalties, and the authorities are obliged to inform the public each time the pollution exceeds the limit.
Reykjavík Energy, which operates the Hellisheiði power plant, has been exploring emission reduction options; including dissolving H2S in condensate water and injecting it back into the high-temperature geothermal reservoir, allowing its mineralisation. This technology is more environment-friendly than the current method of surface-processing H2S gas into sulphur powder, which then needs to be disposed of. The energy company expects that zero emissions can be achieved by 2020 thanks to this technology. The trials have been successful, but increased seismic activity in the area has been reported.

Smart water management
Fukuoka city created an extensive water infrastructure network to meet growing demand for water. The Water Distribution Control Centre monitors and controls water pressure gauges, flow meters and electric valves in the 21 blocks that make up the water service area. The system has been modified repeatedly over the years to address ageing facilities and adapt to demographic changes. The centre can now adjust water pressure based on the level of demand in the relevant block. This improvement has lowered water pressure in the entire system and saved an estimated 4 000 m3-5 000 m3 of water leakage every day. If any part of the system experiences damage, the water supply can be cut off immediately, further minimising water loss.
The Tokyo Metropolitan Government’s Guideline on the Promotion of Efficient Water Usage promotes the installation of non-potable water and rainwater systems. The Business Standards Act, which eases floor-area restrictions, and subsidies for buildings that implement these systems support this initiative. Reliance on surface water has since been reduced and the public is more aware of the importance of saving water. By 2012, 408 facilities had installed in-building recycling systems, 360 had industrial water systems and 1 335 had rainwater systems.

Following the ratification by the Japanese Government of the Kyoto Protocol in June 2002, the Government announced two measures in December 2002: the Biotechnology Strategic Scheme and the Biomass Nippon Strategy. The main objective of the measures was to promote the utilisation of biomass, reduce the consumption of fossil resources and to mitigate global warming through the use of biotechnology. The policy objective stated in the Biotechnology Strategic Scheme is to replace approximately 20% (2.5 to 3 million tons per year) of conventional plastics with plastics from renewable resources by 2020. This initiative has stimulated some major Japanese corporations into sourcing bioplastics for their products e.g. Toyota.

Key Findings
Outdoor air pollution is one important environmental issue that directly affects the quality of people's lives. Despite national and international interventions and decreases in major pollutant emissions, the health impacts of urban air pollution continue to worsen, with air pollution set to become the top environmental cause of premature mortality globally by 2050. Air pollution in urban centres, often caused by transport and the use of small-scale burning of wood or coal, is linked to a range of health problems, from minor eye irritation to upper respiratory symptoms in the short-term and chronic respiratory diseases such as asthma, cardiovascular diseases and lung cancer in the long-term. Children and the elderly may be particularly vulnerable.
PM2.5 – tiny particulate matter small enough to be inhaled into the deepest part of the lung – is monitored in OECD countries because it can harm human health and reduce life expectancy. In Korea, PM2.5 levels are 27.9 micrograms per cubic meter, the highest level in the OECD, where the average is 13.9 micrograms per cubic meter and much higher than the annual guideline limit of 10 micrograms per cubic meter set by the World Health Organization.
Access to clean water is fundamental to human well-being. Despite significant progress in OECD countries in reducing water pollution, improvements in freshwater quality are not always easy to discern. In Korea, 76% of people say they are satisfied with water quality, lower than the OECD average of 81%.

Reducing air pollution in cities
Korea is among the world’s most densely populated countries, with some 70% concentrated in urban areas, particularly near the Seoul Metropolitan area. Air pollution, which already causes a wide range of health problems across the world, poses a real threat to this population. In response, Seoul has taken important measures to reduce air pollution. Yearly emission caps for nitrogen oxides (NOX) and sulphur oxides (SOX) were enforced in 2008. Facilities that exceed their allocated emissions receive fines. Emissions allowances have also been continuously reduced over the years to improve effectiveness. Considering the emission cap management system’s success to date there is potential to expand the system to other parts of the country.
The Seoul Metropolitan Air Quality Control Master Plan (2005-14) successfully reduced air pollutant emissions by half from 2001 levels by 2014. Though air quality improved significantly, PM10 and NO2 concentration targets were not achieved. In a push to continue improving air quality, new concentration targets for PM2.5 and ozone were included in a second master plan for 2015-24.

Reducing air emissions
Over the last decade, Mexico has shown a high commitment to green growth challenges and has set ambitious emission reduction targets. Its General Law on Climate Change aims to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 30% below a business-as-usual scenario by 2020 and by 50% by 2050 from the 2000 level, conditional on international financial support. A carbon tax on fuels was introduced in 2014 and the retail price of gasoline and diesel will be raised until 2017. Gasoline prices will then be liberalised and determined by market conditions in 2018. A national content requirement for non-renewable energy is set to increase from a current 25% to 35% by 2025.

A flexible and integrated approach to climate risks
Climate change poses a challenge for long-term planning in the protection against flooding in river deltas and coastal areas. In the Netherlands, the Delta programme uses an approach called “adaptation pathways” to identify approaches for managing flood risk. Central to this is the identification of tipping points, where the existing set of measures in place would no longer achieve the desired objectives. Once tipping points are identified, a range of potential options are chosen and a monitoring system is established to track changes and ensure there is flexibility to change course if needed. The Delta programme takes a cross-sectoral approach, involving stakeholders in the water sector throughout the process so that all aspects of a decision are taken into account. The Delta Fund, which finances the programme, plans to integrate more of the existing water-related programmes into the yearly EUR 1 billion fund from 2020 onwards.
Energy efficient greenhouses
Dutch greenhouses are a major user of gas and electricity. Greenhouse as Source of Energy is a public-private partnership that works to make greenhouses climate neutral and near-independent of fossil fuels by 2020, and a source of sustainable energy supply by 2050. The main aim of the project is to reduce CO2 emissions by more than half compared to 1990 and reduce energy use per unit of product by 2% every year. Sustainable energy sources would then account for 20% of the energy consumed by greenhouses.
A range of policy instruments are available including R&D transfer and communication, laws and regulations, loan guarantees (for geothermal projects), a subsidy on investment, a tax reduction for energy saving investments, and an exploitation subsidy for renewal energy.
As a result of this work, energy efficiency has doubled since 1990, the number of geothermal energy sites has increased, and more closed or semi-closed greenhouses are in use among growers. Different equipment has been developed, such as a pipe that brings natural gas to growers and combined heat and power systems that use this gas to produce electricity and heat. New innovations include greenhouses that are climate neutral, new dehumidifying options, and hybrid LED options and photosynthesis sensors.

Improving water quality
The Sustainable Dairying: Water Accord is a commitment to reducing agricultural pollution in freshwater bodies and putting environmental best practices in place to protect water bodies. This voluntary agreement between New Zealand’s government and the dairy industry has set out clear performance targets, regular reporting and third-party auditing. Thanks to this accord, environmental best practices (e.g. fencing dairy cattle off from waterways) have been put in place more rapidly than would have occurred through new regulations. To date, it has successfully excluded 96% of the country’s dairy cattle from waterways. Other targets include the preparation of riparian management plans and installation of water intake metres by 85% of farms by 2020.
The 2014 National Policy Statement for Freshwater Management sets minimum standards for human and ecosystem health on water quality and quantity in all water bodies by 2025. It further specifies that water quality in all regions can only be either maintained or improved.
Restoring the water quality of New Zealand’s largest lake
The water quality of Taupō Lake, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, had been consistently decreasing since the 1970s; elevated nitrogen levels from intensified pastoral land use was causing proliferation of microscopic algae, reducing water clarity and increasing the growth of weeds in near shore areas.
In response to the worsening water quality, the government, regional authorities and the local indigenous people implemented an innovative policy package, comprising three components: i) a cap on nitrogen emission levels within the Lake Taupō catchment, calculated from the national nitrogen model OVERSEER®; ii) establishment of the Taupō nitrogen market; and iii) formation of the Lake Taupō Protection Trust to help fund the initiative. The policy package was implemented in 2011, after 11 years of public consultation to come to an agreement. The ability to trade through the establishment of the Taupō nitrogen market was a critical part of the negotiations; farmers wanted flexibility and ability to increase production, or to receive direct financial benefits for reducing nutrient losses. The Lake Taupō Protection Trust reduced the local economic and social impacts of the nitrogen cap by buying back some allocated nitrogen discharge allowances and purchasing farms to shift them to low-nitrogen activities permanently, however this came at a significant cost to the public (NZD 79 million). New lower-nitrogen ventures are emerging in the catchment, such as growing olives, farming dairy sheep, and producing and marketing “sustainable” beef. The environmental certainty enables development of added-value products with credible green branding. The policy package has also generated other positive environmental impacts, particularly carbon sequestration from the reforestation of more than 5 000 ha of land to pine plantations.
The market has provided the flexibility for land to move to its highest value use, while achieving the overall 20% nitrogen load reduction target. The goal is to restore water quality and clarity to 2001 levels by 2080. However, it is too early to assess the impact on water quality due to the considerable time lags between nutrient application to land and its eventual arrival in the lake via groundwater (greater than 100 years in some parts of the catchment).

Norway leads the world in sales of electric vehicles
Thanks to assertive policy actions, Norway has the world’s highest percentage of sales of electric vehicles. In 2015, nearly 25% of cars sold were battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. High sales of electric vehicles must be seen in the context of Norway’s heavy taxes on vehicle purchases and fuels. The country’s high registration taxes are broadly based on vehicle emissions performance.
The Norwegian support scheme for electric vehicles, which began in 1990, includes road and congestion toll exemptions, free parking, zero VAT and access to dedicated bus lanes at given times. The first co-ordinated, nationwide roll-out of public charging infrastructure began in 2009-2010. By 2010, 2 800 new normal charging points were installed. Over the next five years, national government subsidies for public charging installation and operations were gradually devolved to local authorities. By 2016, more than 1 000 fast or “semi-fast” charging stations had been built, and more than 7 500 public charging points were in operation.
Despite having already implemented the above policies for more than a decade, the growth in Norway’s sales shares of electric vehicles are a very recent and unforeseen phenomenon. The long-time lag may stem from the limited choice of models initially on offer, the slow improvement of the characterisics and cost competitiveness of electric vehicles, and delayed consumer response to embrace vehicles when they were initially introduced. Given the ongoing cost gap between electric and conventional cars and limited access to recharging infrastructure, the boom in Norway’s electric vehicle market would have not taken off without the government’s robust support policy.

Combining strong economic growth and lower air pollution
Reducing air pollution has long been a priority for the Slovak Republic. The Slovak government has ratified various international agreements and approved several national programmes for reducing emissions of air pollutants. For instance, the Slovak Republic is a party to the 1979 Geneva Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution (CLRTAP) and its eight protocols. The Slovak Republic has succeeded in achieving economic growth without increasing air pollution, even managing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, in line with its 8% emission reduction targets under the Kyoto Protocol’s first commitment period (by 2012 from 1990 levels).
Two decades of economic restructuring, fuel switching and efficiency gains, and replacement of old polluting technology contributed to this good performance. The Slovak Republic also made major investments in air protection for EU accession and, since then, has defined air quality targets, non-compliance penalties and political responsibilities in line with EU directives. For example, the law obliges polluting operators to pay emission taxes.
However, although most ambient air quality standards are respected, particulate matter and ground-level ozone concentrations frequently exceed limit values for the protection of human health. Tax exemptions, such as those on electricity consumption, also have a harmful environmental impact. Environmental taxation would also be improved by introducing a carbon tax in sectors not covered by EU ETS (e.g. households) and by adding an environmental dimension to the motor vehicle tax, such as air pollution or energy consumption.

Promoting cleaner vehicles
Spain is the third largest European manufacturer of cars and the largest manufacturer of light commercial vehicles. Spain introduced the Efficient Vehicle Incentive Programme (PIVE) in 2012 to reduce the negative environmental impacts of vehicle use in Spain by modernising the nation's vehicle stock. The programme provided a subsidy to replace passenger vehicles over 10 years old and light commercial vehicles over 7 years old with high-efficiency models that use less fuel and CO2 emissions. As of mid-2014, 2 885 car dealers were registered as collaborators. Following the programme’s reported success, the programme was extended for four additional phases.
PIVE is expected to deliver significant pollution reduction benefits, including reduced emissions of CO2. Nearly 365 000 passenger cars and light commercial vehicles have already been replaced. An early evaluation estimates that the PIVE will result in fuel savings close to 127 million litres a year and reduce some 262 000 tonnes of CO2 emissions per year. OECD/ITF analysis of the effectiveness of such replacement schemes underscores the need for targeted incentives and sufficient differentiation, including the need to control the type of replacement vehicle chosen.

Reducing nutrient pollution
The Swedish Environmental Code regulates the impact of agriculture on water habitats and the government has subsidised measures for reducing nutrient leaching. The 2007-13 rural development programme allocated about SEK 510 million for this purpose. The Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management (SwAM) manages the funds for marine and aquatic environments. Out of these funds, SEK 310 million was allocated in 2013 to work with water management, liming, fish conservation, action plans for threatened species and local water projects. Measures to reduce nutrient losses to surrounding water bodies have yielded good results: a study of 65 streams in southern and central Sweden show a downward trend in concentration of nitrogen and phosphorous, directly related to implemented measures. Overall, use of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilisers has dropped during the decade, contributing to reducing nitrogen surplus per hectare of agricultural land to below the OECD average and the level of many other Nordic and Baltic countries.

Despite national and international interventions and decreases in major pollutant emissions, the health impacts of urban air pollution continue to worsen, with air pollution set to become the top environmental cause of premature mortality globally by 2050. Air pollution in urban centres, often caused by transport and the use of small-scale burning of wood or coal, is linked to a range of health problems, from minor eye irritation to upper respiratory symptoms in the short-term and chronic respiratory diseases such as asthma, cardiovascular diseases and lung cancer in the long-term. Children and the elderly may be particularly vulnerable.
PM2.5 – tiny particulate matter small enough to be inhaled into the deepest part of the lung – is monitored in OECD countries because it can harm human health and reduce life expectancy. In Turkey, PM2.5 levels are 20.0 micrograms per cubic meter, much higher than the OECD average of 13.9 micrograms per cubic meter andhigher than the annual guideline limit of 10 micrograms per cubic meter set by the World Health Organization.
Access to clean water is fundamental to human well-being. Despite significant progress in OECD countries in reducing water pollution, improvements in freshwater quality are not always easy to discern. In Turkey, only 65% of people say they are satisfied with water quality, lower than the OECD average of 81%.

Under sea rail tunnel to combat air pollution in Istanbul
Istanbul's growing traffic jams are not just a city transport headache, they also result in high levels of air pollution from vehicle exhausts. To reduce local air pollution, traffic congestion and energy consumption, the Istanbul municipality has launched a number of urban public transport projects. For example, the 8 km subway line which opened in 2000 is being extended, as are the light rail (Hafif-Metro) and tramway systems.
Istanbul has implemented one of the worlds' major transport infrastructure projects, upgrading 63 km of the commuter rail system and building a 13 km rail crossing under the Istanbul Strait (Bosphorus). In addition to reducing congestion, the Marmaray project is expected to improve air quality by reducing vehicle traffic on the two existing bridges that span the Bosphorus. However, to reap maximum environmental benefit from the Marmaray project, complementary actions should be undertaken such as active traffic management on bridge crossings and tight controls on parking.

Efficient and affordable water supply
The UK's Electricity Market Reform aims to expand capacity by increasing investment and competition, and to promote low-carbon energy sources in electricity generation. The reform could slow the increase in household electricity bills and result in yearly savings of about GBP 40 per household on average over 2014-2030.
The Energy Companies Obligation was introduced in 2013 to reduce consumption and support people living in fuel poverty by funding household efficiency improvements. Many water and/or sewage companies introduced social tariffs to reduce bills for customers who have difficulties to pay. This programme works alongside the national Watersure scheme, which caps bills for poor and vulnerable households. An investment of GBP 40 million per year is expected to reduce every customer bill by GBP 50 in South West Water area, which has the highest bills due to underinvestment.
Energy efficiency improvements substantially lowered household electricity and gas consumption, and the share of gas and renewable energy in total energy supply increased between 1990 and 2012 at the expense of coal and oil. However, climate change policies will contribute to raise retail electricity prices, which could offset efforts to tackle fuel and water poverty.

Protecting vulnerable cities
The Rebuild by Design competition was developed in the wake of Superstorm Sandy to spur innovative solutions to protect vulnerable cities from intense weather events. Proposed solutions had to be regionally-scalable and locally-contextual to increase resilience in the region. The competition framework encouraged design teams to invest more time and effort than would be found on the private market. A non-official analysis suggests the Rebuild by Design process leveraged five times the work than what was paid for.
Design teams formed local coalitions to develop fundable, implementable solutions that will inform new policy. This model has since created a network of 535 organisations in the Sandy region, 64 communities, 141 neighbourhoods and cities, and 181 government agencies dedicated to the implementation of projects emerging from the competition. Rebuild by Design continues to work with partners to build out the network to do research, develop case studies, exemplary projects, school programmes and competitions. The competition was named one of CNN’s Best Ideas of 2013.
Re-using contaminated land for renewable energy
The US government promotes renewable energy development (solar panels, wind turbines) on current and formerly contaminated land, landfills and mine sites when such development is aligned with the community's vision for the sites. RE-Powering America's Land Initiative (launched in 2008) bolsters the market for blighted land, diminishes development pressures on open space and promotes renewable energy as an alternative to traditional fossil-fuel power generation. Through reuse of these sites, communities can transform vacant, underutilised or blighted properties, and realise environmental, economic and social benefits. RE-Powering's innovative approach has provided tools, technical assistance and outreach to communities, local and tribal governments, and other stakeholders involved in the remediation of contaminated lands and the development of renewable energy.
Although difficult to directly attribute to the initiative, the number of installations of renewable energy on contaminated lands has increased substantially over the last 5 years where now 73 projects providing over 200 MW of capacity are installed. .

Frequently asked questions
- Renewable energy is energy that is collected from renewable resources, which are naturally replenished on a human time scale—such as solar energy, wind power, hydroelectric power, geothermal energy, tidal power, and biofuels. By 2025, Azure will shift to 100 percent supply of renewable energy, meaning that we will have power purchase agreements (PPA) for green energy contracted for 100 percent of carbon-emitting electricity consumed by all our datacenters, buildings, and campuses.
- Azure, as a part of Microsoft, has been 100 percent carbon neutral since 2012. This means we are removing as much carbon each year as we emit, either by carbon removal (carbon offsetting) or reducing carbon emissions.
- This means that by 2030, we want to remove more carbon each year than we emit. By 2050, our goal is to remove all of our historical carbon emitted—either directly or by electrical consumption—since Microsoft was founded in 1975. .

Poor and middle-income countries need bold new mechanisms to dig out of crushing debt, sharply worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic. . What are the Sustainable Development Goals?
The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), also known as the Global Goals, were adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015 as a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity by 2030.
The 17 SDGs are integrated—that is, they recognize that action in one area will affect outcomes in others, and that development must balance social, economic and environmental sustainability.
Through the pledge to Leave No One Behind, countries have committed to fast-track progress for those furthest behind first. That is why the SDGs are designed to bring the world to several life-changing ‘zeros’, including zero poverty, hunger, AIDS and discrimination against women and girls.
Everyone is needed to reach these ambitious targets. The creativity, knowhow, technology and financial resources from all of society is necessary to achieve the SDGs in every context.
SDG Integration
What is UNDP's role?
As the lead UN development agency, UNDP is well-placed to help implement the Goals through our work in some 170 countries and territories.
We support countries in achieving the SDGs through integrated solutions. Today’s complex challenges—from stemming the spread of disease to preventing conflict—cannot be tackled neatly in isolation.For UNDP, this means focusing on systems, root causes and connections between challenges—not just thematic sectors—to build solutions that respond to people’s daily realities.
Our track record working across the Goals provides us with a valuable experience and proven policy expertise to ensure we all reach the targets set out in the SDGs by 2030. But we cannot do this alone.
Achieving the SDGs requires the partnership of governments, private sector, civil society and citizens alike to make sure we leave a better planet for future generations.

The need to shift to more sustainable diets and food systems is increasingly evident but certainly not simple to achieve. According to the definition by FAO, the sustainability of diets goes beyond nutrition and environment as to include economic and socio-cultural dimensions. This showcases the complexity .
In the past decade, more and more countries have started to incorporate sustainability considerations into their food policies and consumer education programmes. Given the policy and programmatic implications of FBDGs, the development and integration of recommendations that promote specific food practices and choices have been an obvious strategy for addressing sustainability, mainly in its nutrition and environment dimensions.
Such recommendations include for example: having a mostly plant-based diet, focus on seasonal and local foods, reduction of food waste, consumption of fish from sustainable stocks only and reduction of red and processed meat, highly-processed foods and sugar-sweetened beverages.
The joint publication of FAO and the Food Climate Research Network: Plates, pyramids, planet provides an in depth review of the state of play of how countries incorporate sustainability into their FBDGs.
Examples of national guidelines that address sustainability issues can be found under ""useful links"" on the right hand-side column in this page. Please note that FAO does not necessarily endorse the views expressed in the external documents and websites.
Sustainable diets are those diets with low environmental impacts which contribute to food and nutrition security and to healthy life for present and future generations. Sustainable diets are protective and respectful of biodiversity and ecosystems, culturally acceptable, accessible, economically fair and affordable; nutritionally adequate, safe and healthy; while optimizing natural and human resources.

The Embry-Riddle Company is founded by T. Higbee Embry and John Paul Riddle at Cincinnati’s Lunken Airport on Dec. 17 – exactly 22 years to the day after the Wright brothers’ famed flight at Kitty Hawk.
The Embry-Riddle Flying School, which opened in spring 1926, gains attention in 1927 when the school trains student Frank Shelton to fly solo in only 5 hours, 34 minutes – believed to be the shortest amount of time at that point.
Cincinnati becomes one of the nation’s first cities with direct Airmail service. The Embry-Riddle Company wins the contract because it had ""gained a name for itself through the industry, the quality of its flying school, and the high tone of operations at Lunken Airport,"" according to the Cincinnati Enquirer.
After thorough examination by the Aeronautics Branch of the U.S. Department of Commerce, Embry-Riddle’s Flying School becomes one of the first five schools in the country to receive an “Approved School Certificate” under the Air Commerce Act.
The U.S. government selects the now Miami-based Embry-Riddle Company to train pilots for the U.S. Army Air Corps, the predecessor to the U.S. Air Force. By the height of WWII, Embry-Riddle is the largest privately operated flight school in the world.
In the post-war years, the Riddle Aeronautical Institute continues to train pilots but struggles financially until the early 1960s, when increased demand for aviators causes the school to outgrow its Miami facilities.
The Embry-Riddle Aeronautical Institute, established as a non-profit corporation in 1959, moves from Miami to Daytona Beach, FL, in 1965, in what the school calls “Operation Bootstrap.”
Embry-Riddle achieves university status in 1970 and becomes Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. That same year, the first residence center is established in Fort Rucker, AL, the beginning of Embry-Riddle’s Worldwide Campus. Later in the decade, the university opens a residential campus in Prescott, AZ.
With residential campuses now in Daytona Beach, FL, and Prescott, AZ, tens of thousands of online students, and many Worldwide locations around the world, Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University continues to train the world’s best pilots, plus some of the best engineers, mechanics, air traffic controllers, meteorologists, and many others. .

COVID-19 & vaccines: We must not fail humanity’s greatest test . Green Growth means fostering economic growth and development, while ensuring that natural assets continue to provide the resources and environmental services on which our well-being relies. . Twenty years after the first Rio Summit, the world continues to face a twin challenge: expanding economic opportunities for all in the context of a growing global population; and addressing environmental pressures that, if left unaddressed, could undermine our ability to seize these opportunities. Green growth is where these two challenges meet and it is about exploiting the opportunities to realise the two together.
Green growth means fostering economic growth and development while ensuring that natural assets continue to provide the resources and environmental services on which our well-being relies.
To do this it must catalyse investment and innovation which will underpin sustained growth and give rise to new economic opportunities.
Green growth is not a replacement for sustainable development. Rather, it provides a practical and flexible approach for achieving concrete, measurable progress across its economic and environmental pillars, while taking full account of the social consequences of greening the growth dynamic of economies. The focus of green growth strategies is ensuring that natural assets can deliver their full economic potential on a sustainable basis. That potential includes the provision of critical life support services – clean air and water, and the resilient biodiversity needed to support food production and human health. Natural assets are not infinitely substitutable and green growth policies take account of that.
In May 2011, the OECD delivered its Green Growth Strategy to Heads of State and Ministers from over forty countries, who welcomed it as a useful tool for expanding economic growth and job creation through more sustainable use of natural resources, efficiencies in the use of energy, and valuation of ecosystem services.
The Strategy responds to a request from Ministers of the 34 countries who signed the Green Growth Declaration in 2009, committing to strengthen their efforts to pursue green growth strategies as part of their response to the economic crisis and beyond.
Green growth policies are an integral part of the structural reforms needed to foster strong, more sustainable and inclusive growth. They can unlock new growth engines by:
Strategies for greener growth need to be tailored to fit specific country circumstances. They will need to carefully consider how to manage any potential trade-offs and best exploit the synergies between green growth and poverty reduction. The latter include, for example, bringing more efficient infrastructure to people (e.g. in energy, water and transport), tackling poor health associated with environmental degradation and introducing efficient technologies that can reduce costs and increase productivity, while easing environmental pressure. Given the centrality of natural assets in low-income countries, green growth policies can reduce vulnerability to environmental risks and increase the livelihood security of the poor.
Green growth strategies also recognise that focusing on GDP as the main measure of economic progress generally overlooks the contribution of natural assets to wealth, health and well-being. They therefore need to rely on a broader range of measures of progress, encompassing the quality and composition of growth, and how this affects people’s wealth and welfare.
The OECD is working to identify the policy mixes and measurement tools that countries in different situations can adopt to implement green growth in a way that contributes to poverty eradication, employment opportunities, and a strong and sustainable economy.
The starting point of OECD work is that there is no “one-size-fits-all” prescription for fostering greener growth. Greening the growth path of an economy depends on policy and institutional settings, level of development, social structures, resource endowments and particular environmental pressure points. Advanced, emerging, and developing countries will face different challenges and opportunities. While national plans will differ, in all cases green growth strategies need to go hand-in-hand with the main pillars of action to promote social equity: more intensive human capital investment, inclusive employment promotion, and well-designed tax/transfer redistribution policies.
The OECD report on Green Growth and Developing Countries aims to identify promising areas in which green growth objectives could be achieved and the policies, regulations, technology transfer, financing and new market and innovation opportunities that could help to deliver them. It reviews key barriers and includes options for a policy framework and a set of criteria that developing countries could consider in their efforts towards green growth policy making. Work will also commence on how progress could be assessed.
The report was developed based on a consultative process with developing countries. It aims to provide a platform for developing country partners to indicate their interest in collaborating with the OECD to shape a green growth agenda that is feasible and relevant for them and addresses the aspirations of their citizens.

wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_business https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_development ,"Sustainable business
A sustainable business, or a green business, is an enterprise that has minimal negative impact or potentially a positive effect on the global or local environment, community, society, or economy—a business that strives to meet the triple bottom line. They cluster under different groupings and the whole is sometimes referred to as ""green capitalism."" [1] Often, sustainable businesses have progressive environmental and human rights policies. In general, business is described as green if it matches the following four criteria:[2]
- It incorporates principles of sustainability into each of its business decisions.
- It supplies environmentally friendly products or services that replaces demand for nongreen products and/or services.
- It is greener than traditional competition.
- It has made an enduring commitment to environmental principles in its business operations.
Terminology[edit]
A sustainable business is any organization that participates in Environmentally friendly or green activities to ensure that all processes, products, and manufacturing activities adequately address current environmental concerns while maintaining a profit. In other words, it is a business that “meets the needs of the present [world] without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.”[3][4] It is the process of assessing how to design products that will take advantage of the current environmental situation and how well a company’s products perform with renewable resources.[5]
The Brundtland Report emphasized that sustainability is a three-legged stool of people, planet, and profit.[3] Sustainable businesses with the supply chain try to balance all three through the triple-bottom-line concept—using sustainable development and sustainable distribution to affect the environment, business growth, and the society.[6][7]
Everyone affects the sustainability of the marketplace and the planet in some way. Sustainable development within a business can create value for customers, investors, and the environment. A sustainable business must meet customer needs while, at the same time, treating the environment well.[8] To succeed in such an approach, where stakeholder balancing and joint solutions are key, requires a structural approach. One philosophy, that includes many different tools and methods, is the concept of Sustainable Enterprise Excellence.[9] Another is the adoption of the concept of responsible growth.[10]
Sustainability is often confused with corporate social responsibility (CSR), though the two are not the same. Bansal and DesJardine (2014) state that the notion of ‘time’ discriminates sustainability from CSR and other similar concepts. Whereas ethics, morality, and norms permeate CSR, sustainability only obliges businesses to make intertemporal trade-offs to safeguard intergenerational equity. Short-termism is the bane of sustainability.[11]
Green business has been seen as a possible mediator of economic-environmental relations, and if proliferated, would serve to diversify our economy, even if it has a negligible effect at lowering atmospheric CO2 levels. The definition of ""green jobs"" is ambiguous, but it is generally agreed that these jobs, the result of green business, should be linked to clean energy, and contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gases. These corporations can be seen as generators of not only ""green energy"", but as producers of new ""materialities"" that are the product of the technologies these firms developed and deployed.[12]
Environmental sphere[edit]
A major initiative of sustainable businesses is to eliminate or decrease the environmental harm caused by the production and consumption of their goods.[13] The impact of such human activities in terms of the number of greenhouse gases produced can be measured in units of carbon dioxide and is referred to as the carbon footprint. The carbon footprint concept is derived from the ecological footprint analysis, which examines the ecological capacity required to support the consumption of products.[14]
Businesses take a wide range of green initiatives. One of the most common examples is the act of ""going paperless"" or sending electronic correspondence in lieu of paper when possible.[8] On a higher level, examples of sustainable business practices include: refurbishing used products (e.g., tuning up lightly used commercial fitness equipment for resale); revising production processes to eliminate waste (such as using a more accurate template to cut out designs), and choosing nontoxic raw materials and processes. For example, Canadian farmers have found that hemp is a sustainable alternative to rapeseed in their traditional crop rotation; hemp grown for fiber or seed requires no pesticides or herbicides.
Sustainable business leaders also take into account the life cycle costs for the items they produce. Input costs must be considered regarding regulations, energy use, storage, and disposal.[15] Designing for the environment DFE is also an element of sustainable business. This process enables users to consider the potential environmental impacts of a product and the process used to make that product.[15]
The many possibilities for adopting green practices have led to considerable pressure being put upon companies from consumers, employees, government regulators, and other stakeholders.[16] Some companies have resorted to greenwashing instead of making meaningful changes, merely marketing their products in ways that suggest green practices. For example, various producers in the bamboo fiber industry have been taken to court for advertising their products as more ""green"" than they are.[17] Still, countless other companies have taken the sustainability trend seriously and are enjoying profits. In their book “Corporate Sustainability in International Comparison”, Schaltegger et al. (2014) analyzes the current state of corporate sustainability management and corporate social responsibility across eleven countries. Their research is based on an extensive survey focusing on the companies’ intention to pursue sustainability management (i.e. motivation; issues), the integration of sustainability in the organization (i.e. connecting sustainability to the core business; involving corporate functions; using drivers of business cases for sustainability) and the actual implementation of sustainability management measures (i.e. stakeholder management; sustainability management tools and standards; measurements).[18] The Gort Cloud written by Richard Seireeni, (2009), documents the experiences of sustainable businesses in America and their reliance on the vast but invisible green community, referred to as the gort cloud, for support and a market.
Green investment firms are consequently attracting unprecedented interest. In the UK, for instance, the Green Investment Bank is devoted exclusively to supporting renewable domestic energy. However, the UK and Europe as a whole are falling behind the impressive pace set by developing nations in terms of green development.[19] Thus, green investment firms are creating more and more opportunities to support sustainable development practices in emerging economies. By providing micro-loans and larger investments, these firms assist small business owners in developing nations who seek business education, affordable loans, and new distribution networks for their ""green"" products.
An effective way for businesses to contribute towards waste reduction is to remanufacture products so that the materials used can have a longer life-span.[20]
Sustainable Businesses[edit]
The Harvard Business School business historian Geoffrey Jones (academic) has traced the historical origins of green business back to pioneering start-ups in organic food and wind and solar energy before World War 1.[21] Among large corporations, Ford Motor Company occupies an odd role in the story of sustainability. Ironically, founder Henry Ford was a pioneer in the sustainable business realm, experimenting with plant-based fuels during the days of the Model T.[8] Ford Motor Company also shipped the Model A truck in crates that then became the vehicle floorboards at the factory destination. This was a form of upcycling, retaining high quality in a closed-loop industrial cycle.[15] Furthermore, the original auto body was made of a stronger-than-steel hemp composite. Today, of course, Fords aren't made of hemp nor do they run on the most sensible fuel. Currently, Ford's claim to eco-friendly fame is the use of seat fabric made from 100% post-industrial materials and renewable soy foam seat bases. Ford executives recently appointed the company’s first senior vice president of sustainability, environment, and safety engineering. This position is responsible for establishing a long-range sustainability strategy and environmental policy. The person in this position will also help develop the products and processes necessary to satisfy both customers and society as a whole while working toward energy independence. It remains to be seen whether Ford will return to its founder's vision of a petroleum-free automobile, a vehicle powered by the remains of plant matter.[5]
The automobile manufacturer Subaru is a sustainability giant. In 2008 a Subaru assembly plant in Lafayette became the first auto manufacturer to achieve zero landfill status when the plant implemented sustainable policies. The company successfully managed to implement a plan that increased refuse recycling to 99.8%.[22] In 2012, the corporation increased the reuse of Styrofoam by 9%. And from the year 2008 to the year 2012, environmental incidents and accidents reduced from 18 to 4.[23]
Smaller companies such as Nature's Path, an organic cereal and snack making business, have also made significant sustainability gains in the 21st century. CEO Arran Stephens and his associates have ensured that the quickly growing company's products are produced without toxic farm chemicals. Furthermore, employees are constantly encouraged to find ways to reduce consumption. Sustainability is an essential part of corporate discussions.[24] Another example comes from Salt Spring Coffee, a company created in 1996 as a certified organic, fair trade, coffee producer.[25] In recent years they have become carbon neutral, lowering emissions by reducing long-range trucking and using bio-diesel in delivery trucks,[26] upgrading to energy efficient equipment and purchasing carbon offsets. The company claims to offer the first carbon neutral coffee sold in Canada.[27] Salt Spring Coffee was recognized by the David Suzuki Foundation in the 2010 report Doing Business in a New Climate.[28] A third example comes from Korea, where rice husks are used as a nontoxic packaging for stereo components and other electronics. The same material is later recycled to make bricks.[15]
The mining and specifically gold mining industries are also moving towards more sustainable practices, especially given that the industry is one of the most environmentally destructive.[29] Indeed, regarding gold mining, Northwestern University scientists have, in the laboratory, discovered an inexpensive and environmentally sustainable method that uses simple cornstarch—instead of cyanide—to isolate gold from raw materials in a selective manner.[30] Such a method will reduce the amount of cyanide released into the environment during gold extraction from raw ore, with one of the Northwestern University scientists, Sir Fraser Stoddart stating that: “The elimination of cyanide from the gold industry is of the utmost importance environmentally"".[31] Additionally, the retail jewelry industry is now trying to be totally sustainable, with companies using green energy providers and recycling more,[32] as well as preventing the use of mined-so called 'virgin gold' by applying re-finishing methods on pieces and re-selling them.[33] Furthermore, the customer may opt for Fairtrade Gold,[34] which gives a better deal to small scale and artisanal miners, and is an element of sustainable business.[35] However, not all think that mining can be sustainable and much more must be done, noting that mining in general is in need of greater regional and international legislation and regulation, which is a valid point given the huge impact mining has on the planet and the huge number of products and goods that are made wholly or partly from mined materials.[36]
Social sphere[edit]
Organizations that give back to the community, whether through employees volunteering their time or through charitable donations are often considered socially sustainable. Organizations also can encourage education in their communities by training their employees and offering internships to younger members of the community. Practices such as these increase the education level and quality of life in the community.
For a business to be truly sustainable, it must sustain not only the necessary environmental resources, but also social resources—including employees, customers (the community), and its reputation.[37]
Organizations[edit]
The European community’s Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive restricts the use of certain hazardous materials in the production of various electronic and electrical products. Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) directives provide collection, recycling, and recovery practices for electrical goods.[8] The World Business Council for Sustainable Development and the World Resources Institute are two organizations working together to set a standard for reporting on corporate carbon footprints.[8] From October 2013, all quoted companies in the UK are legally required to report their annual greenhouse gas emissions in their directors’ report, under the Companies Act 2006 (Strategic and Directors’ Reports) Regulations 2013.[38][39]
Lester Brown’s Plan B 2.0 and Hunter Lovins’s Natural Capitalism provide information on sustainability initiatives.[40]
Corporate sustainability strategies[edit]
Corporate sustainability strategies can aim to take advantage of sustainable revenue opportunities, while protecting the value of business against increasing energy costs, the costs of meeting regulatory requirements, changes in the way customers perceive brands and products, and the volatile price of resources.
Not all eco-strategies can be incorporated into a company's Eco-portfolio immediately. The widely practiced strategies include: Innovation, Collaboration, Process Improvement and Sustainability reporting.
- 1. Innovation & Technology
This introverted method of sustainable corporate practices focuses on a company's ability to change its products and services towards less waste production and sustainable best practices.
- 2. Collaboration
The formation of networks with similar or partner companies facilitates knowledge sharing and propels innovation.
- 3. Process Improvement
Continuous process surveying and improvement are essential to reduction in waste. Employee awareness of company-wide sustainability plan further aids the integration of new and improved processes.
- 4. Sustainability Reporting
Periodic reporting of company performance in relation to goals. These goals are often incorporated into the corporate mission (as in the case of Ford Motor Co.).[41]
- 5. Greening the Supply Chain
Sustainable procurement is important for any sustainability strategy as a company's impact on the environment is much bigger than the products that they consume. The B Corporation (certification) model is a good example of one that encourages companies to focus on this.
Additionally, companies might consider implementing a sound measurement and management system with readjustment procedures, as well as a regular forum for all stakeholders to discuss sustainability issues.[42] The Sustainability Balanced Scorecard is a performance measurement and management system aiming at balancing financial and non-financial as well as short and long-term measures. It explicitly integrates strategically relevant environmental, social and ethical goals into the overall performance management system [43] and supports strategic sustainability management.
Standards[edit]
Enormous economic and population growth worldwide in the second half of the twentieth century aggravated the factors that threaten health and the world — ozone depletion, climate change, depletion, fouling of natural resources, and extensive loss of biodiversity and habitat. In the past, the standard approaches to environmental problems generated by business and industry have been regulatory-driven ""end-of-the-pipe"" remediation efforts. In the 1990s, efforts by governments, NGOs, corporations, and investors began to grow substantially to develop awareness and plans for investment in business sustainability.
One critical milestone was the establishment of the ISO 14000 standards whose development came as a result of the Rio Summit on the Environment held in 1992. ISO 14001 is the cornerstone standard of the ISO 14000 series. It specifies a framework of control for an Environmental Management System against which an organization can be certified by a third party. Other ISO 14000 Series Standards are actually guidelines, many to help you achieve registration to ISO 14001. They include the following:
- ISO 14004 provides guidance on the development and implementation of environmental management systems
- ISO 14010 provides general principles of environmental auditing (now superseded by ISO 19011)
- ISO 14011 provides specific guidance on audit an environmental management system (now superseded by ISO 19011)
- ISO 14012 provides guidance on qualification criteria for environmental auditors and lead auditors (now superseded by ISO 19011)
- ISO 14013/5 provides audit program review and assessment material.
- ISO 14020+ labeling issues
- ISO 14030+ provides guidance on performance targets and monitoring within an Environmental Management System
- ISO 14040+ covers life cycle issues
Circular business models[edit]
While the initial focus of academic, industry, and policy activities was mainly focused on the development of re-X (recycling, remanufacturing, reuse,...) technology, it soon became clear that the technological capabilities increasingly exceed their implementation. To leverage this technology for the transition towards a Circular Economy, different stakeholders have to work together. This shifted attention towards business model innovation as a key leverage for 'circular' technology adaption.[44]
Circular business models are business models that are closing, narrowing, slowing, intensifying, and dematerializing loops, to minimize the resource inputs into and the waste and emission leakage out of the organizational system. This comprises recycling measures (closing), efficiency improvements (narrowing), use phase extensions (slowing or extending), a more intense use phase (intensifying), and the substitution of product utility by service and software solutions (dematerializing).[45]
LEED certification[edit]
The Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design standards were developed by the US Green Building Council in an effort to propel green building design in the United States. LEED certification is very prestigious title and can be attained through ""compliance with all environmental laws and regulations, occupancy scenarios, building permanence and pre-rating completion, site boundaries and area-to-site ratios, and obligatory five-year sharing of whole building energy and water use data from the start of occupancy (for new construction) or date of certification (for existing buildings)"".[15].[46]
Challenges and opportunities[edit]
Implementing sustainable business practices may have an effect on profits and a firm's financial 'bottom line'. At first blush, this challenge might make many corporate executives cringe. However, during a time where environmental awareness is popular, green strategies are likely to be embraced by employees, consumers, and other stakeholders. In fact, according to many studies, a positive correlation exists between environmental performance and economic performance.[47]
If an organization’s current business model is inherently unsustainable, becoming a truly sustainable business requires a complete makeover of the business model (e.g. from selling cars to offering car sharing and other mobility services). This can present a major challenge due to the differences between the old and the new model and the respective skills, resources and infrastructure needed. A new business model can also offer major opportunities by entering or even creating new markets and reaching new customer groups.[48]
Companies leading the way in sustainable business practices can be said to be taking advantage of sustainable revenue opportunities: according to the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills the UK green economy to grow by 4.9 to 5.5 percent a year by 2015,[49] and the average internal rate of return on energy efficiency investments for large businesses is 48%.[50] A 2013 survey suggests that demand for green products appears to be increasing: 27% of respondents said they are more likely to buy a sustainable product and/or service than 5 years ago.[51] Furthermore, sustainable business practices may attract talent and generate tax breaks.[52]

Sustainable development is the organizing principle for meeting human development goals while simultaneously sustaining the ability of natural systems to provide the natural resources and ecosystem services on which the economy and society depend. The desired result is a state of society where living conditions and resources are used to continue to meet human needs without undermining the integrity and stability of the natural system. Sustainable development can be defined as development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. Sustainability goals, such as the current UN-level Sustainable Development Goals, address the global challenges, including poverty, inequality, climate change, environmental degradation, peace, and justice.
While the modern concept of sustainable development is derived mostly from the 1987 Brundtland Report, it is also rooted in earlier ideas about sustainable forest management and twentieth-century environmental concerns. As the concept of sustainable development developed, it has shifted its focus more towards the economic development, social development and environmental protection for future generations. It has been suggested that ""the term 'sustainability' should be viewed as humanity's target goal of human–ecosystem equilibrium (homeostasis[contradictory]), while 'sustainable development' refers to the holistic approach and temporal processes that lead us to the end point of sustainability"".[1] Modern economies are endeavouring to reconcile ambitious economic development and obligations of preserving natural resources and ecosystems, as the two are usually seen as of conflicting nature. Instead of holding climate change commitments and other sustainability measures as a remedy to economic development, turning and leveraging[clarification needed] them into market opportunities will do greater good.[unbalanced opinion?] The economic development brought by such organized principles and practices in an economy is called Managed Sustainable Development (MSD).[attribution needed]
The concept of sustainable development has been, and still is, subject to criticism, including the question of what is to be sustained in sustainable development. It has been argued that there is no such thing as a sustainable use of a non-renewable resource, since any positive rate of exploitation will eventually lead to the exhaustion of earth's finite stock;[2]:13 this perspective renders the Industrial Revolution as a whole unsustainable.[3]:20f[4]:61–67[5]:22f It has also been argued that the meaning of the concept has opportunistically been stretched from 'conservation management' to 'economic development', and that the Brundtland Report promoted nothing but a business as usual strategy for world development, with an ambiguous and insubstantial concept attached as a public relations slogan. (see below).[6]:48–54[7]:94–99
History of sustainability[edit]
Sustainability can be defined as the practice of maintaining world processes of productivity indefinitely—natural or human-made—by replacing resources used with resources of equal or greater value without degrading or endangering natural biotic systems.[9] Sustainable development ties together concern for the carrying capacity of natural systems with the social, political, and economic challenges faced by humanity. Sustainability science is the study of the concepts of sustainable development and environmental science. There is an additional focus on the present generations' responsibility to regenerate, maintain and improve planetary resources for use by future generations.[10]:3–8
Sustainable development has its roots in ideas about sustainable forest management which were developed in Europe during the 17th and 18th centuries.[11][8]:6–16 In response to a growing awareness of the depletion of timber resources in England, John Evelyn argued, ""Sowing and planting of trees had to be regarded as a national duty of every landowner, in order to stop the destructive over-exploitation of natural resources."" in his 1662 essay Sylva. In 1713 Hans Carl von Carlowitz, a senior mining administrator in the service of Elector Frederick Augustus I of Saxony published Sylvicultura economics, a 400-page work on forestry. Building upon the ideas of Evelyn and French minister Jean-Baptiste Colbert, von Carlowitz developed the concept of managing forests for sustained yield.[11] His work influenced others, including Alexander von Humboldt and Georg Ludwig Hartig, eventually leading to the development of the science of forestry. This, in turn, influenced people like Gifford Pinchot, the first head of the US Forest Service, whose approach to forest management was driven by the idea of wise use of resources, and Aldo Leopold whose land ethic was influential in the development of the environmental movement in the 1960s.[11][8]
Following the publication of Rachel Carson's Silent Spring in 1962, the developing environmental movement drew attention to the relationship between economic growth and development and environmental degradation. Kenneth E. Boulding in his influential 1966 essay The Economics of the Coming Spaceship Earth identified the need for the economic system to fit itself to the ecological system with its limited pools of resources.[8] Another milestone was the 1968 article by Garrett Hardin that popularized the term ""tragedy of the commons"".[12] One of the first uses of the term sustainable in the contemporary sense was by the Club of Rome in 1972 in its classic report on the Limits to Growth, written by a group of scientists led by Dennis and Donella Meadows of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Describing the desirable ""state of global equilibrium"", the authors wrote: ""We are searching for a model output that represents a world system that is sustainable without sudden and uncontrolled collapse and capable of satisfying the basic material requirements of all of its people.""[10] That year also saw the publication of the influential A Blueprint for Survival book.[13][14]
Following the Club of Rome report, an MIT research group prepared ten days of hearings on ""Growth and Its Implication for the Future"" (Roundtable Press, 1973)[15] for the US Congress, the first hearings ever held on sustainable development. William Flynn Martin, David Dodson Gray, and Elizabeth Gray prepared the hearings under the Chairmanship of Congressman John Dingell.[16]
In 1980 the International Union for the Conservation of Nature published a world conservation strategy that included one of the first references to sustainable development as a global priority[17] and introduced the term ""sustainable development"".[18]:4 Two years later, the United Nations World Charter for Nature raised five principles of conservation by which human conduct affecting nature is to be guided and judged.[19] In 1987 the United Nations World Commission on Environment and Development released the report Our Common Future, commonly called the Brundtland Report. The report included what is now one of the most widely recognised definitions of sustainable development.[20][21]
Sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. It contains within it two key concepts:
- The concept of 'needs', in particular, the essential needs of the world's poor, to which overriding priority should be given; and
- The idea of limitations imposed by the state of technology and social organization on the environment's ability to meet present and future needs.
Since the Brundtland Report, the concept of sustainable development has developed beyond the initial intergenerational framework to focus more on the goal of ""socially inclusive and environmentally sustainable economic growth"".[18]:5 In 1992, the UN Conference on Environment and Development published the Earth Charter, which outlines the building of a just, sustainable, and peaceful global society in the 21st century. The action plan Agenda 21 for sustainable development identified information, integration, and participation as key building blocks to help countries achieve development that recognises these interdependent pillars. It emphasises that in sustainable development everyone is a user and provider of information. It stresses the need to change from old sector-centred ways of doing business to new approaches that involve cross-sectoral co-ordination and the integration of environmental and social concerns into all development processes. Furthermore, Agenda 21 emphasises that broad public participation in decision making is a fundamental prerequisite for achieving sustainable development.[22]
Under the principles of the United Nations Charter the Millennium Declaration identified principles and treaties on sustainable development, including economic development, social development and environmental protection. Broadly defined, sustainable development is a systems approach to growth and development and to manage natural, produced, and social capital for the welfare of their own and future generations. The term sustainable development as used by the United Nations incorporates both issues associated with land development and broader issues of human development such as education, public health, and standard of living.[23]
A 2013 study concluded that sustainability reporting should be reframed through the lens of four interconnected domains: ecology, economics, politics and culture.[24]
Education for sustainable development[edit]
Education for sustainable development (ESD) is defined as education that encourages changes in knowledge, skills, values, and attitudes to enable a more sustainable and equitable society. ESD aims to empower and equip current and future generations to meet the needs using a balanced and integrated approach to the economic, social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development.[25]
The concept of ESD was born from the need for education to address the growing and changing environmental challenges facing the planet. To do this, education must change to provide the knowledge, skills, values and attitudes that empower learners to contribute to sustainable development. At the same time, education must be strengthened in all agendas, programmes, and activities that promote sustainable development. Sustainable development must be integrated into education and education must be integrated into sustainable development. ESD promotes the integration of these critical sustainability issues in local and global contexts into the curriculum to prepare learners to understand and respond to the changing world. ESD aims to produce learning outcomes that include core competencies such as critical and systematic thinking, collaborative decision-making, and taking responsibility for the present and future generations. Since traditional single-directional delivery of knowledge is not sufficient to inspire learners to take action as responsible citizens, ESD entails rethinking the learning environment, physical and virtual. The learning environment itself must adapt and apply a whole-institution approach to embed the philosophy of sustainable development. Building the capacity of educators and policy support at international, regional, national and local levels helps drive changes in learning institutions. Empowered youth and local communities interacting with education institutions become key actors in advancing sustainable development.[25]
UN Decade for Education for Sustainable Development[edit]
The launch of the United Nations Decade of Education for Sustainable Development (2005–2014) started a global movement to reorient education to address the challenges of sustainable development. Building on the achievement of the Decade, stated in the Aichi-Nagoya Declaration on ESD, UNESCO endorsed the Global Action Programme on ESD (GAP) in the 37th session of its General Conference. Acknowledged by UN general assembly Resolution A/RES/69/211 and launched at the UNESCO World Conference on ESD in 2014, the GAP aims to scale-up actions and good practices. UNESCO has a major role, along with its partners, in bringing about key achievements to ensure the principles of ESD are promoted through formal, non-formal and informal education.[26]
International recognition of ESD as the key enabler for sustainable development is growing steadily. The role of ESD was recognized in three major UN summits on sustainable development: the 1992 UN Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) in Johannesburg, South Africa; and the 2012 UN Conference on Sustainable Development (UNCSD) in Rio de Janeiro. Other key global agreements such as the Paris Agreement (Article 12) also recognize the importance of ESD. Today, ESD is arguably at the heart of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (United Nations, 2015). The SDGs recognize that all countries must stimulate action in the following key areas – people, planet, prosperity, peace and partnership – to tackle the global challenges that are crucial for the survival of humanity. Some of these SDGs include ensuring affordable and clean energy, providing clean water and sanitation, and partnership for these goals. ESD is explicitly mentioned in Target 4.7 of SDG4, which aims to ensure that all learners acquire the knowledge and skills needed to promote sustainable development and is understood as an important means to achieve all the other 16 SDGs (UNESCO, 2017).[25] Additionally, SDG17 focuses on strengthening the means of implementation and revitalization of global partnership for sustainable development.[27]
Sub-groups[edit]
|Scheme of sustainable development:|
at the confluence of three constituent parts. (2006)
Sustainable development can be thought of in terms of three spheres, dimensions, domains or pillars, i.e. the environment, the economy and society. The three-sphere framework was initially proposed by the economist Rene Passet in 1979.[28] It has also been worded as ""economic, environmental and social"" or ""ecology, economy and equity"".[29] This has been expanded by some authors to include a fourth pillar of culture, institutions or governance,[29] or alternatively reconfigured as four domains of the social – ecology, economics, politics and culture,[30] thus bringing economics back inside the social, and treating ecology as the intersection of the social and the natural.[31]
Environmental (or ecological)[edit]
The ecological stability of human settlements is part of the relationship between humans and their natural, social and built environments.[32] Also termed human ecology, this broadens the focus of sustainable development to include the domain of human health. Fundamental human needs such as the availability and quality of air, water, food and shelter are also the ecological foundations for sustainable development;[33] addressing public health risk through investments in ecosystem services can be a powerful and transformative force for sustainable development which, in this sense, extends to all species.[34]
Environmental sustainability concerns the natural environment and how it endures and remains diverse and productive. Since natural resources are derived from the environment, the state of air, water, and the climate is of particular concern. The IPCC Fifth Assessment Report outlines current knowledge about scientific, technical and socio-economic information concerning climate change, and lists options for adaptation and mitigation.[35] Environmental sustainability requires society to design activities to meet human needs while preserving the life support systems of the planet. This, for example, entails using water sustainably, using renewable energy, and sustainable material supplies (e.g. harvesting wood from forests at a rate that maintains the biomass and biodiversity).[36]
An unsustainable situation occurs when natural capital (the total of nature's resources) is used up faster than it can be replenished. Sustainability requires that human activity only uses nature's resources at a rate at which they can be replenished naturally. Inherently the concept of sustainable development is intertwined with the concept of carrying capacity. Theoretically, the long-term result of environmental degradation is the inability to sustain human life. Such degradation on a global scale should imply an increase in human death rate until population falls to what the degraded environment can support. If the degradation continues beyond a certain tipping point or critical threshold it would lead to eventual extinction for humanity.[37]
|Consumption of natural resources||State of the environment||Sustainability|
|More than nature's ability to replenish||Environmental degradation||Not sustainable|
|Equal to nature's ability to replenish||Environmental equilibrium||Steady state economy|
|Less than nature's ability to replenish||Environmental renewal||Environmentally sustainable|
Integral elements for a sustainable development are research and innovation activities. A telling example is the European environmental research and innovation policy, which aims at defining and implementing a transformative agenda to greening the economy and the society as a whole so to achieve a truly sustainable development. Research and innovation in Europe is financially supported by the programme Horizon 2020, which is also open to participation worldwide.[38] A promising direction towards sustainable development is to design systems that are flexible and reversible.[39][40]
Pollution of the public resources is not a different action, it is just a reverse tragedy of the commons, in that instead of taking something out, something is put into the commons. When the costs of polluting the commons are not calculated into the cost of the items consumed, then it becomes only natural to pollute, as the cost of pollution is external to the cost of the goods produced and the cost of cleaning the waste before it is discharged exceeds the cost of releasing the waste directly into the commons. So, the only way to solve this problem is by protecting the ecology of the commons by making it, through taxes or fines, more costly to release the waste directly into the commons than would be the cost of cleaning the waste before discharge.[41]
Agriculture[edit]
Sustainable agriculture consists of environment friendly methods of farming that allow the production of crops or livestock without damage to human or natural systems. It involves preventing adverse effects to soil, water, biodiversity, surrounding or downstream resources—as well as to those working or living on the farm or in neighbouring areas. The concept of sustainable agriculture extends intergenerationally, passing on a conserved or improved natural resource, biotic, and economic base rather than one which has been depleted or polluted.[42] Elements of sustainable agriculture include permaculture, agroforestry, mixed farming, multiple cropping, and crop rotation.[43] It involves agricultural methods that do not undermine the environment, smart farming technologies that enhance a quality environment for humans to thrive and reclaiming and transforming deserts into farmlands(Herman Daly, 2017).[citation needed]
Numerous sustainability standards and certification systems exist, including organic certification, Rainforest Alliance, Fair Trade, UTZ Certified, GlobalGAP, Bird Friendly, and the Common Code for the Coffee Community (4C).[44][45] These standards specify rules that producers , manufacturers and traders need to follow so that the things they make, grow or do don’t hurt people and the environment.[46] According to the ITC Standards Map, the mostly covered sector by sustainability standards is the agricultural sector.[47]
Economics[edit]
|Part of a series on|
|Ecological economics|
It has been suggested that because of rural poverty and overexploitation, environmental resources should be treated as important economic assets, called natural capital.[48] Economic development has traditionally required a growth in the gross domestic product. This model of unlimited personal and GDP growth may be over. Sustainable development may involve improvements in the quality of life for many but may necessitate a decrease in resource consumption.[49] According to ecological economist Malte Faber, ecological economics is defined by its focus on nature, justice, and time. Issues of intergenerational equity, irreversibility of environmental change, uncertainty of long-term outcomes, and sustainable development guide ecological economic analysis and valuation.[50]
As early as the 1970s, the concept of sustainability was used to describe an economy ""in equilibrium with basic ecological support systems"".[51] Scientists in many fields have highlighted The Limits to Growth,[52][53] and economists have presented alternatives, for example a 'steady-state economy', to address concerns over the impacts of expanding human development on the planet.[5] In 1987 the economist Edward Barbier published the study The Concept of Sustainable Economic Development, where he recognised that goals of environmental conservation and economic development are not conflicting and can be reinforcing each other.[54]
A World Bank study from 1999 concluded that based on the theory of genuine savings, policymakers have many possible interventions to increase sustainability, in macroeconomics or purely environmental.[55] Several studies have noted that efficient policies for renewable energy and pollution are compatible with increasing human welfare, eventually reaching a golden-rule steady state.[56][57][58][59]
The study, Interpreting Sustainability in Economic Terms, found three pillars of sustainable development, interlinkage, intergenerational equity, and dynamic efficiency.[60]
But Gilbert Rist points out that the World Bank has twisted the notion of sustainable development to prove that economic development need not be deterred in the interest of preserving the ecosystem. He writes: ""From this angle, 'sustainable development' looks like a cover-up operation. ... The thing that is meant to be sustained is really 'development', not the tolerance capacity of the ecosystem or of human societies.""[61]
The World Bank, a leading producer of environmental knowledge, continues to advocate the win-win prospects for economic growth and ecological stability even as its economists express their doubts.[62] Herman Daly, an economist for the Bank from 1988 to 1994, writes:
When authors of WDR '92 [the highly influential 1992 World Development Report that featured the environment] were drafting the report, they called me asking for examples of ""win-win"" strategies in my work. What could I say? None exists in that pure form; there are trade-offs, not ""win-wins."" But they want to see a world of ""win-wins"" based on articles of faith, not fact. I wanted to contribute because WDRs are important in the Bank, [because] task managers read [them] to find philosophical justification for their latest round of projects. But they did not want to hear about how things really are, or what I find in my work...[63]
A meta review in 2002 looked at environmental and economic valuations and found a lack of ""sustainability policies"".[64] A study in 2004 asked if we consume too much.[65] A study concluded in 2007 that knowledge, manufactured and human capital (health and education) has not compensated for the degradation of natural capital in many parts of the world.[66] It has been suggested that intergenerational equity can be incorporated into a sustainable development and decision making, as has become common in economic valuations of climate economics.[67] A meta review in 2009 identified conditions for a strong case to act on climate change, and called for more work to fully account of the relevant economics and how it affects human welfare.[68] According to free-market environmentalist John Baden ""the improvement of environment quality depends on the market economy and the existence of legitimate and protected property rights"". They enable the effective practice of personal responsibility and the development of mechanisms to protect the environment. The State can in this context ""create conditions which encourage the people to save the environment"".[69]
Misum, Mistra Center for Sustainable Markets, based at Stockholm School of Economics, aims to provide policy research and advice to Swedish and international actors on Sustainable Markets. Misum is a cross-disciplinary and multi-stakeholder knowledge centre dedicated to sustainability and sustainable markets and contains three research platforms: Sustainability in Financial Markets (Mistra Financial Systems), Sustainability in Production and Consumption and Sustainable Socio-Economic Development.[70]
Environmental economics[edit]
The total environment includes not just the biosphere of earth, air, and water, but also human interactions with these things, with nature, and what humans have created as their surroundings.[71]
As countries around the world continue to advance economically, they put a strain on the ability of the natural environment to absorb the high level of pollutants that are created as a part of this economic growth. Therefore, solutions need to be found so that the economies of the world can continue to grow, but not at the expense of the public good. In the world of economics, the amount of environmental quality must be considered as limited in supply and therefore is treated as a scarce resource. This is a resource to be protected. One common way to analyze possible outcomes of policy decisions on the scarce resource is to do a cost-benefit analysis.[citation needed] This type of analysis contrasts different options of resource allocation and, based on an evaluation of the expected courses of action and the consequences of these actions, the optimal way to do so in the light of different policy goals can be elicited.[72]
The benefit-cost analysis basically can look at several ways of solving a problem and then assigning the best route for a solution, based on the set of consequences that would result from the further development of the individual courses of action, and then choosing the course of action that results in the least amount of damage to the expected outcome for the environmental quality that remains after that development or process takes place. Further complicating this analysis are the interrelationships of the various parts of the environment that might be impacted by the chosen course of action. Sometimes it is almost impossible to predict the various outcomes of a course of action, due to the unexpected consequences and the number of unknowns that are not accounted for in the benefit-cost analysis.[73]
Energy[edit]
|Part of a series about|
|Sustainable energy|
|Overview|
|Energy conservation|
|Renewable energy|
|Sustainable transport|
The use of energy is considered sustainable if it meets the needs of the present without compromising the needs of future generations. Definitions of sustainable energy include environmental aspects such as greenhouse gas emissions, and social and economic aspects such as energy poverty. The energy transition to meet the world's needs for electricity, heating, cooling, and transport in a sustainable way is one of the greatest challenges facing humanity in the 21st century. Energy production and consumption are responsible for over 70% of greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change, contribute to air pollution, water scarcity and biodiversity loss, and can generate toxic waste. Nearly a billion people lack access to electricity and over 2.5 billion rely on dirty fuels such as wood or charcoal to cook.
Renewable energy sources such as wind, hydroelectric power, solar, and geothermal energy are generally far more sustainable than fossil fuel sources. However, some renewable energy projects, such as the clearing of forests for the production of biofuels, can cause severe environmental damage. Nuclear power is a low-carbon source and has a safety record comparable to wind and solar,[74] but its sustainability has been debated due to concerns about nuclear proliferation, nuclear waste, and accidents. Switching from coal to natural gas has environmental benefits, but may lead to a delay in switching to more sustainable options. Costs of wind, solar, and batteries have fallen rapidly and are projected to continue falling due to innovation and economies of scale. To accommodate larger shares of variable energy sources, the electrical grid needs additional infrastructure such as grid energy storage. These sources generated 8.5% of worldwide electricity in 2019, a share that has grown rapidly. A sustainable energy system is likely to see a shift towards more use of electricity in sectors such as transport, energy conservation, and the use of hydrogen produced by renewables or from fossil fuels with carbon capture and storage. Electricity and clean-burning fuels are being deployed to replace usage of highly polluting cooking fuels in lower-income countries.[75]
Technology[edit]
One of the core concepts in sustainable development is that technology can be used to assist people to meet their developmental needs. Technology to meet these sustainable development needs is often referred to as appropriate technology, which is an ideological movement (and its manifestations) originally articulated as intermediate technology by the economist E. F. Schumacher in his influential work Small Is Beautiful and now covers a wide range of technologies.[76] Both Schumacher and many modern-day proponents of appropriate technology also emphasise the technology as people-centered.[77] Today appropriate technology is often developed using open source principles, which have led to open-source appropriate technology (OSAT) and thus many of the plans of the technology can be freely found on the Internet.[78] OSAT has been proposed as a new model of enabling innovation for sustainable development.[79][80] Free Software, including that which runs Wikimedia, is licensed under the GNU GPL, or a similar license. It is this licensing model that has enabled the global wiki movement, not the licensing model of Open Source, which by itself is inadequate to prevent proprietary vendors from redistributing unfree versions of designs and software that they obtained gratis. Richard Stallman, the founder of the movement that created the GNU/Linux operating system, has explained in detail the ethical and legal underpinnings of these projects as Four Essential Freedoms of Free Software.
Transport[edit]
Transportation is a large contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. It is said that one-third of all gases produced are due to transportation.[81] Motorized transport also releases exhaust fumes that contain particulate matter which is hazardous to human health and a contributor to climate change.[82]
Sustainable transport has many social and economic benefits that can accelerate local sustainable development. According to a series of reports by the Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership (LEDS GP), sustainable transport can help create jobs,[83] improve commuter safety through investment in bicycle lanes and pedestrian pathways,[84] make access to employment and social opportunities more affordable and efficient. It also offers a practical opportunity to save people's time and household income as well as government budgets,[85] making investment in sustainable transport a 'win-win' opportunity.
Some Western countries are making transportation more sustainable in both long-term and short-term implementations.[86] An example is the modification in available transportation in Freiburg, Germany. The city has implemented extensive methods of public transportation, cycling, and walking, along with large areas where cars are not allowed.[81]
Since many Western countries are highly automobile-oriented, the main transit that people use is personal vehicles. About 80% of their travel involves cars.[81] Therefore, California, is one of the highest greenhouse gases emitters in the United States. The federal government has to come up with some plans to reduce the total number of vehicle trips to lower greenhouse gases emission. Such as:
- Improve public transport through the provision of larger coverage area in order to provide more mobility and accessibility, new technology to provide a more reliable and responsive public transportation network.[87]
- Encourage walking and biking through the provision of wider pedestrian pathway, bike share stations in downtowns, locate parking lots far from the shopping center, limit on street parking, slower traffic lane in downtown area.
- Increase the cost of car ownership and gas taxes through increased parking fees and tolls, encouraging people to drive more fuel efficient vehicles. This can produce a social equity problem, since lower income people usually drive older vehicles with lower fuel efficiency. Government can use the extra revenue collected from taxes and tolls to improve public transportation and benefit poor communities.[88]
Other states and nations have built efforts to translate knowledge in behavioral economics into evidence-based sustainable transportation policies.[89]
Business[edit]
The most broadly accepted criterion for corporate sustainability constitutes a firm's efficient use of natural capital.[citation needed] This eco-efficiency is usually calculated as the economic value added by a firm in relation to its aggregated ecological impact.[90] This idea has been popularised by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) under the following definition: ""Eco-efficiency is achieved by the delivery of competitively priced goods and services that satisfy human needs and bring quality of life, while progressively reducing ecological impacts and resource intensity throughout the life-cycle to a level at least in line with the earth's carrying capacity"" (DeSimone and Popoff, 1997: 47).[91]
Similar to the eco-efficiency concept but so far less explored is the second criterion for corporate sustainability. Socio-efficiency[92] describes the relation between a firm's value added and its social impact. Whereas, it can be assumed that most corporate impacts on the environment are negative (apart from rare exceptions such as the planting of trees) this is not true for social impacts. These can be either positive (e.g. corporate giving, creation of employment) or negative (e.g. work accidents, mobbing of employees, human rights abuses). Depending on the type of impact socio-efficiency thus either tries to minimise negative social impacts (i.e. accidents per value added) or maximise positive social impacts (i.e. donations per value added) in relation to the value added.[citation needed]
Both eco-efficiency and socio-efficiency are concerned primarily with increasing economic sustainability. In this process they instrumentalise both natural and social capital aiming to benefit from win-win situations. However, as Dyllick and Hockerts[92] point out the business case alone will not be sufficient to realise sustainable development. They point towards eco-effectiveness, socio-effectiveness, sufficiency, and eco-equity as four criteria that need to be met if sustainable development is to be reached.[93]
CASI Global, New York ""CSR & Sustainability together lead to sustainable development. CSR as in corporate social responsibility is not what you do with your profits, but is the way you make profits. This means CSR is a part of every department of the company value chain and not a part of HR / independent department. Sustainability as in effects towards Human resources, Environment and Ecology has to be measured within each department of the company."" CASI Global
Income[edit]
At the present time,[clarification needed] sustainable development can reduce poverty. Sustainable development reduces poverty through financial (among other things, a balanced budget), environmental (living conditions), and social (including equality of income) means.[94]
Architecture and construction[edit]
In sustainable architecture the recent movements of New Urbanism and New Classical architecture promote a sustainable approach towards construction that appreciates and develops smart growth, architectural tradition and classical design.[95][96] This in contrast to modernist and International Style architecture, as well as opposing to solitary housing estates and suburban sprawl, with long commuting distances and large ecological footprints.[97]
The global design and construction industry is responsible for approximately 39 percent of greenhouse gas emissions.[98] Green building practices that avoid emissions or capture the carbon already present in the environment, allow for reduced footprint of the construction industry, for example, use of hempcrete, cellulose fiber insulation, and landscaping.[99]
Politics[edit]
A study concluded that social indicators and, therefore, sustainable development indicators, are scientific constructs whose principal objective is to inform public policy-making.[100] The International Institute for Sustainable Development has similarly developed a political policy framework, linked to a sustainability index for establishing measurable entities and metrics. The framework consists of six core areas:
- International trade and investment
- Economic policy
- Climate change and energy
- Measurement and assessment
- Natural resource management
- Communication technologies.
The United Nations Global Compact Cities Programme has defined sustainable political development in a way that broadens the usual definition beyond states and governance. The political is defined as the domain of practices and meanings associated with basic issues of social power as they pertain to the organisation, authorisation, legitimation and regulation of a social life held in common. This definition is in accord with the view that political change is important for responding to economic, ecological and cultural challenges. It also means that the politics of economic change can be addressed. They have listed seven subdomains of the domain of politics:[101]
- Organization and governance
- Law and justice
- Communication and critique
- Representation and negotiation
- Security and accord
- Dialogue and reconciliation
- Ethics and accountability
This accords with the Brundtland Commission emphasis on development that is guided by human rights principles (see above).
Culture[edit]
Working with a different emphasis, some researchers and institutions have pointed out that a fourth dimension should be added to the dimensions of sustainable development, since the triple-bottom-line dimensions of economic, environmental and social do not seem to be enough to reflect the complexity of contemporary society. In this context, the Agenda 21 for culture and the United Cities and Local Governments (UCLG) Executive Bureau lead the preparation of the policy statement ""Culture: Fourth Pillar of Sustainable Development"", passed on 17 November 2010, in the framework of the World Summit of Local and Regional Leaders – 3rd World Congress of UCLG, held in Mexico City. This document inaugurates a new perspective and points to the relation between culture and sustainable development through a dual approach: developing a solid cultural policy and advocating a cultural dimension in all public policies. The Circles of Sustainability approach distinguishes the four domains of economic, ecological, political and cultural sustainability.[102][103][104]
Other organizations have also supported the idea of a fourth domain of sustainable development. The Network of Excellence ""Sustainable Development in a Diverse World"",[105] sponsored by the European Union, integrates multidisciplinary capacities and interprets cultural diversity as a key element of a new strategy for sustainable development. The Fourth Pillar of Sustainable Development Theory has been referenced by executive director of IMI Institute at UNESCO Vito Di Bari[106] in his manifesto of art and architectural movement Neo-Futurism, whose name was inspired by the 1987 United Nations' report Our Common Future. The Circles of Sustainability approach used by Metropolis defines the (fourth) cultural domain as practices, discourses, and material expressions, which, over time, express continuities and discontinuities of social meaning.[101]
Cultural elements in sustainable development frameworks[edit]
Recently, human-centered design and cultural collaboration have been popular frameworks for sustainable development in marginalized communities.[107][108][109][110] These frameworks involve open dialogue which entails sharing, debating, and discussing, as well as holistic evaluation of the site of development.[107][108][109][110] Especially when working on sustainable development in marginalized communities, cultural emphasis is a crucial factor in project decisions, since it largely affects aspects of their lives and traditions.[107] Collaborators use Articulation Theory in co-designing. This allows for them to understand each other's thought process and their comprehension of the sustainable projects.[107] By using the method of co-design, the beneficiaries' holistic needs are being considered.[107][109] Final decisions and implementations are made with respect to sociocultural and ecological factors.[110][109][108][107]
Human centered design[edit]
The user-oriented framework relies heavily on user participation and user feedback in the planning process.[111] Users are able to provide new perspective and ideas, which can be considered in a new round of improvements and changes.[111] It is said that increased user participation in the design process can garner a more comprehensive understanding of the design issues, due to more contextual and emotional transparency between researcher and participant.[111] A key element of human centered design is applied ethnography, which was a research method adopted from cultural anthropology.[111] This research method requires researchers to be fully immersed in the observation so that implicit details are also recorded.[111]
Life cycle analysis[edit]
Many communities express environmental concerns, so life cycle analysis is often conducted when assessing the sustainability of a product or prototype.[112][109][107] The assessment is done in stages with meticulous cycles of planning, design, implementation, and evaluation.[113] The decision to choose materials is heavily weighted on its longevity, renewability, and efficiency. These factors ensure that researchers are conscious of community values that align with positive environmental, social, and economic impacts.[112]
Themes[edit]
Progress[edit]
The United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (UNCSD; also known as Rio 2012) was the third international conference on sustainable development, which aimed at reconciling the economic and environmental goals of the global community. An outcome of this conference was the development of the Sustainable Development Goals that aim to promote sustainable progress and eliminate inequalities around the world. However, few nations met the World Wide Fund for Nature's definition of sustainable development criteria established in 2006.[114] Although some nations are more developed than others, all nations are constantly developing because each nation struggles with perpetuating disparities, inequalities and unequal access to fundamental rights and freedoms.[115]
Measurement[edit]
In 2007 a report for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency stated: ""While much discussion and effort has gone into sustainability indicators, none of the resulting systems clearly tells us whether our society is sustainable. At best, they can tell us that we are heading in the wrong direction, or that our current activities are not sustainable. More often, they simply draw our attention to the existence of problems, doing little to tell us the origin of those problems and nothing to tell us how to solve them.""[116]
Most recently, a paper about monitoring urban water sustainability published in the Journal of Environmental Management [117] argued that sustainable development is being reconsidered as a process with unknown endpoint. The paper explains that outputs of sustainable urban water systems defined as ‘policies, projects, laws, technologies, and consumption and reuse amounts associated with urban water sustainability goals’ are therefore being viewed as inadequate monitoring instruments. The article proposes a new methodology for sustainability monitoring whereby normality of a system is diagnosed through normality of its supporting inputs in lieu of normality of its complex outputs. Supporting inputs are ‘intents and behaviors that support system goals’. Supporting inputs follow a principle of self-organization to remain in the norm and behavior zone commonly associated with system goals. This implies that normality of supporting inputs can be inferred from their longitudinally normal or Gaussian distribution that can be explored by significance tests. The article identifies fourteen supporting inputs of sustainable urban water systems - such as internet searches, community campaigns, staff training, agent-principal reporting and legislation propositions about water sustainability – and defines quantitative indicators for them. The Shapiro-Wilk test and Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (K–S) of these indicators and a subsequent Boxplot outlying examination of non-normal indicators are undertaken in a case study. Qualitative examination of non-normal supporting inputs confirms the ability of this statistical methodology to detect problems in the system.[118]
Nevertheless, a majority of authors assume that a set of well defined and harmonised indicators is the only way to make sustainability tangible. Those indicators are expected to be identified and adjusted through empirical observations (trial and error).[119]
The most common critiques are related to issues like data quality, comparability, objective function and the necessary resources.[120] However a more general criticism is coming from the project management community: How can a sustainable development be achieved at global level if we cannot monitor it in any single project?[121][122]
The Cuban-born researcher and entrepreneur Sonia Bueno suggests an alternative approach that is based upon the integral, long-term cost-benefit relationship as a measure and monitoring tool for the sustainability of every project, activity or enterprise.[123][124] Furthermore, this concept aims to be a practical guideline towards sustainable development following the principle of conservation and increment of value rather than restricting the consumption of resources.[citation needed]
Reasonable qualifications of sustainability are seen U.S. Green Building Council's (USGBC) Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED). This design incorporates some ecological, economic, and social elements. The goals presented by LEED design goals are sustainable sites, water efficiency, energy consumption and atmospheric emission reduction, material and resource efficiency, and indoor environmental quality. Although amount of structures for sustainability development is many, these qualification has become a standard for sustainable building.[citation needed]
Recent research efforts created also the SDEWES Index to benchmark the performance of cities across aspects that are related to energy, water and environment systems. The SDEWES Index consists of 7 dimensions, 35 indicators, and close to 20 sub-indicators. It is currently applied to 58 cities.[125]
Natural capital[edit]
The sustainable development debate is based on the assumption that societies need to manage three types of capital (economic, social, and natural), which may be non-substitutable and whose consumption might be irreversible.[92] Leading ecological economist and steady-state theorist Herman Daly,[5] for example, points to the fact that natural capital can not necessarily be substituted by economic capital. While it is possible that we can find ways to replace some natural resources, it is much more unlikely that they will ever be able to replace eco-system services, such as the protection provided by the ozone layer, or the climate stabilizing function of the Amazonian forest. In fact natural capital, social capital and economic capital are often complementarities. A further obstacle to substitutability lies also in the multi-functionality of many natural resources. Forests, for example, not only provide the raw material for paper (which can be substituted quite easily), but they also maintain biodiversity, regulate water flow, and absorb CO2.[citation needed]
Another problem of natural and social capital deterioration lies in their partial irreversibility. The loss of biodiversity, for example, is often definitive. The same can be true for cultural diversity. For example, with globalisation advancing quickly the number of indigenous languages is dropping at alarming rates. Moreover, the depletion of natural and social capital may have non-linear consequences. Consumption of natural and social capital may have no observable impact until a certain threshold is reached. A lake can, for example, absorb nutrients for a long time while actually increasing its productivity. However, once a certain level of algae is reached lack of oxygen causes the lake's ecosystem to break down suddenly.[126]
Business-as-usual[edit]
If the degradation of natural and social capital has such important consequence the question arises why action is not taken more systematically to alleviate it. Cohen and Winn[127] point to four types of market failure as possible explanations: First, while the benefits of natural or social capital depletion can usually be privatised, the costs are often externalised (i.e. they are borne not by the party responsible but by society in general). Second, natural capital is often undervalued by society since we are not fully aware of the real cost of the depletion of natural capital. Information asymmetry is a third reason—often the link between cause and effect is obscured, making it difficult for actors to make informed choices. Cohen and Winn close with the realization that contrary to economic theory many firms are not perfect optimisers. They postulate that firms often do not optimise resource allocation because they are caught in a ""business as usual"" mentality.[citation needed]
Education[edit]
Main page: Education for sustainable development
Education must be revisited in light of a renewed vision of sustainable human and social development that is both equitable and viable. This vision of sustainability must take into consideration the social, environmental and economic dimensions of human development and the various ways in which these relate to education: 'An empowering education is one that builds the human resources we need to be productive, to continue to learn, to solve problems, to be creative, and to live together and with nature in peace and harmony. When nations ensure that such an education is accessible to all throughout their lives, a quiet revolution is set in motion: education becomes the engine of sustainable development and the key to a better world.'[128][129]

Insubstantial stretching of the term[edit]
It has been argued that since the 1960s, the concept of sustainable development has changed from ""conservation management"" to ""economic development"", whereby the original meaning of the concept has been stretched somewhat.[6]:48–54
In the 1960s, the international community realised that many African countries needed national plans to safeguard wildlife habitats, and that rural areas had to confront the limits imposed by soil, climate and water availability. This was a strategy of conservation management. In the 1970s, however, the focus shifted to the broader issues of the provisioning of basic human needs, community participation as well as appropriate technology use throughout the developing countries (and not just in Africa). This was a strategy of economic development, and the strategy was carried even further by the Brundtland Commission's report on Our Common Future when the issues went from regional to international in scope and application.[6]:48–54 In effect, the conservationists were crowded out and superseded by the developers.
But shifting the focus of sustainable development from conservation to development has had the imperceptible effect of stretching the original forest management term of sustainable yield from the use of renewable resources only (like forestry), to now also accounting for the use of non-renewable resources (like minerals).[2]:13 This stretching of the term has been questioned. Thus, environmental economist Kerry Turner has argued that literally, there can be no such thing as overall ""sustainable development"" in an industrialised world economy that remains heavily dependent on the extraction of earth's finite stock of exhaustible mineral resources: ""It makes no sense to talk about the sustainable use of a non-renewable resource (even with substantial recycling effort and reduction in use rates). Any positive rate of exploitation will eventually lead to exhaustion of the finite stock.""[2]:13
In effect, it has been argued that the industrial revolution as a whole is unsustainable.[3]:20f[4]:61–67[5]:22f[130]:52
One critic has argued that the Brundtland Commission promoted nothing but a business as usual strategy for world development, with the ambiguous and insubstantial concept of ""sustainable development"" attached as a public relations slogan:[7]:94–99 The report on Our Common Future was largely the result of a political bargaining process involving many special interest groups, all put together to create a common appeal of political acceptability across borders. After World War II, the notion of ""development"" had been established in the West to imply the projection of the American model of society onto the rest of the world. In the 1970s and 1980s, this notion was broadened somewhat to also imply human rights, basic human needs and finally, ecological issues. The emphasis of the report was on helping poor nations out of poverty and meeting the basic needs of their growing populations—as usual. This issue demanded more economic growth, also in the rich countries, who would then import more goods from the poor countries to help them out—as usual. When the discussion switched to global ecological limits to growth, the obvious dilemma was left aside by calling for economic growth with improved resource efficiency, or what was termed ""a change in the quality of growth"". However, most countries in the West had experienced such improved resource efficiency since the early-20th century already and as usual; only, this improvement had been more than offset by continuing industrial expansion, to the effect that world resource consumption was now higher than ever before—and these two historical trends were completely ignored in the report. Taken together, the policy of perpetual economic growth for the entire planet remained virtually intact. Since the publication of the report, the ambiguous and insubstantial slogan of ""sustainable development"" has marched on worldwide.[7]:94–99

unl,https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/ ,"The upper-level circulation over the contiguous U.S. (CONUS) during this U.S. Drought Monitor (USDM) week consisted of a ridge over the West Coast and trough over the north central states. Strong closed lows rotated within this upper-level flow, bounding from the Southwest to the Northeast in their trek across the country. The ridge blocked Pacific moisture from entering the country and kept the West Coast warmer than normal for the week. The trough funneled cold and dry Canadian air into the Plains. The cold fronts moved south and east, bringing colder-than-normal air to much of the CONUS from the Great Basin to the Appalachians and beyond to the Mid-Atlantic Coast. Only parts of the Southeast and Northeast averaged warmer than normal for the week. The fronts and their surface lows brought rain and snow to the northern and central Rockies as they bumped up against the mountains, with precipitation amounts meeting or exceeding weekly normals in parts of the northern to central Rockies and High Plains. The fronts and surface lows spread above-normal rainfall across Oklahoma and northern Texas to Florida, with amounts along the northern Gulf Coast exceeding 5 inches in places. They also brought rain to the Northeast, with some areas nearing or exceeding weekly normals. But much of the West, northern Plains to Ohio Valley, Southeast, and Maine were drier than normal for the week. Streamflow was well below normal all along the West Coast and in the interior West, in North Dakota and northwest South Dakota, parts of southern Texas, the southern and eastern Great Lakes, and parts of the Northeast. Soils continued to dry out in the West and Southeast, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) reports. Satellite and station reports, as well as modeled indices, showed dry soils across the West, northern and southern Plains, the southern and eastern Great Lakes, and into the Northeast, as well as parts of the Southeast. Groundwater observations from wells and estimated from satellite measurements revealed dry conditions across the West, northern and southern Plains, Northeast, and parts of the Southeast. The cumulative effect of lack of precipitation and drying soils has stressed vegetation, as seen in such indices as the Vegetative Health Index and VegDRI, as well as field reports.
Half an inch or more of rain fell across much of the Northeast, from New York to Maine, with up to 2 inches locally across parts of New England. Half an inch was also noted across southern parts of West Virginia, Maryland, and Delaware. Less than half an inch fell in between across Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey, and northern Maryland and Delaware. The rain was enough to prevent further expansion of the moderate drought (D1) and abnormal dryness (D0) in the region, but not enough to warrant contraction. The rain did improve soil moisture conditions, dropping the percentage values of soils short to very short of moisture down to 65% in New Hampshire and in the 20s and 30s in other New England states. Still, local authorities in New Hampshire were monitoring water supplies and preparing to adopt water restrictions if dry conditions persist, while Massachusetts residents continued to conserve water.
The extreme northern and southern ends of the Southeast received rain this week, with very little precipitation in between. Half an inch of precipitation was noted in Virginia with half an inch to 2 inches, and locally more, over Florida and extreme southern Alabama. The Florida rain contracted D0 in the central and southern parts of the state, while D1 in the south was reduced to better reflect improving drought indicators. D0 expanded in Alabama and Georgia and spread into the Carolinas as dryness this week added to deficits that have been growing for the last 3 months. Several in situ (ground) based and satellite-based indicators revealed drying soils, and field reports from South Carolina included cattlemen in Aiken having to feed hay now due to forage growth being limited, farmers having to begin irrigating crops (which is rare to non-existent for this time of year), and other farmers having to stop planting corn due to lack of soil moisture. According to USDA reports, the percent of the soils short or very short of moisture doubled in South Carolina this week to 55% of the state having dry soils, while the value in Georgia increased to 26%.
Heavy rains fell across frontal zones over Louisiana and southern Mississippi where up to 5 inches was reported for the week. Rainfall totals of 2 inches or more covered most of Louisiana into northeast Texas and parts of Oklahoma. Half an inch or more was widespread across Arkansas, eastern to central Oklahoma, and northern, eastern, and extreme southern Texas. Meanwhile, most of the Rio Grande Valley, west Texas, and western Oklahoma received little to no precipitation. Drought and abnormal dryness contracted in parts of Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Texas, while extreme (D3) to exceptional (D4) drought expanded in parts of west Texas. The rains improved soils across parts of Texas and Oklahoma, but USDA reports still have 60% of Texas and 26% of Oklahoma with topsoil moisture short or very short.
Precipitation brushed the edges of the Midwest region, with half an inch or more falling over parts of western Missouri, southwest Iowa, northern Minnesota, and Upper Michigan. Most of the region received less than 0.25 inch of precipitation for the week. D1 expanded in northeast Illinois, northern Ohio, and across much of Michigan. D0 expanded in parts of Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, and Ohio. But D0 and D1 contracted in northern Minnesota where recent precipitation has reduced drought indicators. USDA reports of short or very short topsoil moisture ranged from 9% in Illinois to 29% in Iowa. County extension field reports in east central Indiana included drought impacts on planting, pasture growth, and pond levels.
Cooler temperatures and snow spread across parts of the northern Plains this week. Western and southern parts of the High Plains region received 0.5-1.5 inches of precipitation this week, while the Dakotas were mostly dry with less than 0.25 inch. Precipitation in Wyoming in recent weeks has improved several drought indicators, especially the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), resulting in significant contraction of the D3 area in the central part of the state. D0-D2 shrank in other parts, but D1-D2 expanded in western Wyoming. Colorado saw contraction of D1-D2 in the north. Half an inch to over an inch of precipitation in southwest South Dakota shrank D2, while D2 was removed from southeast South Dakota due to improving indicators. Even though much of Montana received welcome snow this week, in most areas it amounted to below-normal precipitation, so D1-D3 expanded. Abnormal dryness contracted in south central Montana where precipitation has been above normal. In North Dakota, the snow was enough to prevent further deterioration but not enough to reduce deficits. Parts of the state remain in a burn ban and are experiencing dry soils, poor pasture conditions, and drying ponds and dugouts, some of which were testing high in TDS and sulfates. Producers are selling or making plans to cull more livestock. Dust storms have been reported recently in North Dakota and Montana. USDA reports show 78% of North Dakota, 61% of Montana, 58% of South Dakota, 56% of Wyoming, and 49% of Colorado with topsoil moisture short or very short.
Just the higher mountains of northern Utah, northeast Nevada, and the Sierra Nevada in California received any precipitation this week, and that was only 0.25-1.5 inches, which was barely normal for this time of year. Most of the rest of the West received no precipitation. Low streamflow, dry soils, and precipitation deficits over the last 3 months or longer prompted expansion of abnormal dryness and drought all along the West Coast. In Washington, D0 expanded to the coast and D1 spread northeastward, with only above-normal snow water content (SWE) and water-year-to-date (WYTD) precipitation keeping the Olympic and Cascade Mountains free of abnormal dryness. The D1, and some D0, spread across northern Idaho and into northwest Montana. D1-D2 expanded in western and northeastern Oregon. D1-D3 expanded in California to better reflect the soil moisture, streamflow, and SPI indicators. Agricultural impacts along the southern California coast were especially severe. The sparse timing of rain that has occurred this season (end of December and end of January) has contributed to especially poor growth of the annual grasses that are needed for livestock feed. According to reports, the amount of forage on rangelands is low, with producers in Ventura County already shipping whole herds of cattle out of county because there is almost no forage. As the USDM week ended, California Governor Newsom declared a drought emergency in Mendocino and Sonoma counties. Other drought impacts around the region: Historically low water levels caused the closure of some launch ramps on Lake Powell. The Klamath Project will receive 33,000 acre-feet of water in 2021, about one-tenth the average amount, for the lowest allocation in the project’s history, due to drought and low inflows into Upper Klamath Lake. Dust storms have been reported recently in Oregon and blowing dust in eastern Washington. According to USDA reports, the percentage of topsoil moisture short or very short jumped this week to 65% of California and Oregon and 60% of Washington. The percentage increased slightly to 87% of New Mexico. April 21 reports of mountain SWE in California included 32% of normal in the North, 37% in the Central, and 16% in the South.
No change was made to the depiction in Alaska or Hawaii. The week was drier than normal across both states, and warmer than normal in Alaska but cooler than normal in Hawaii, and streamflow was still normal in Hawaii. D0 was expanded along the southern coast of Puerto Rico and into eastern sections due to below-normal precipitation for the last week to 4 months, low streamflows, and drying soils.
Palau had over 12 inches of rain in just one week, surpassing the monthly threshold of 8 inches to meet most water needs. This resulted in continued drought free conditions for Palau.
Dry conditions were present across the Marianas this week, with Guam, Rota, and Saipan reporting less than half an inch of rain. Monthly precipitations for the last few months were also below the threshold of 4 inches to meet most water needs for all three locations. According to the NWS Tiyan, Guam forecast, the KBDI (an index used to determine forest fire potential) was 718. The maximum value for KBDI is 800, which represents very dry conditions. Due to the dry weather, the NWS doesn’t recommend outdoor burning since spot fires will ignite easily. Given this, Guam’s drought classification was degraded by one category this week. Rota’s (D0-S) and Saipan’s (D1-S) drought remained unchanged.
Across the Federated States of Micronesia, Yap, Kosrae, and Lukunor had the highest rainfall totals this week, with rainfall totals above 5 inches. Pohnpei, Pingelap, Nukuoro, Ulithi, and Woleai also had a wet week with rainfall totals surpassing the weekly threshold of 2 inches of rain. Fananu had a little less than 2 inches of rain this week. However, all of these locations continued to be drought free. Chuuk was the only location with little rain this week, receiving only 0.32 inch of rain. However, drought free conditions were unchanged this week since last month rainfall totals were over 18 inches. Kapingamarangi also had over 5 inches of rain this week, resulting in a month-to-date rainfall of 15.05 inches. According to the drought information statement produced by the NWS Tiyan, Guam, catchments are full and vegetation is starting to recover across the region. For this reason, Kapingamarangi's drought classification was improved by one category (from D2-L to D1-L).
This was a wet week for most of the Marshall Islands, with most locations receiving over 2 inches of rain. Ailinglaplap had the most rainfall at 5.61 inches. Meanwhile, Wotje had the least rainfall at 0.90 inch of rain. Wotje’s drought classification of extreme drought continued since the last few months have been very dry. Even though Kwajalein had a very wet week (3.90 inches), its drought classification of severe drought was unchanged due to local reports on yellowing vegetation and water shortages. There were no drought concerns in the other locations.
Drought free conditions persisted in Tutuila since rainfall totals across the three locations were close to or over 2 inches of rain.
Dry and very warm conditions continued to affect the USVI this week. St. Croix had no rain at the Henry E. Rohlsen airport and the Christainset 4.1 ESE CoCoRaHs station this week, while only 0.11 inch of rain was reported at the Christiansted 4.11.6 E station. The dry conditions were accompanied by very warm temperatures, with daily maximum temperatures of 87 deg F or higher. On April 14, the maximum temperature of 89 deg F at the airport tied the daily record last set in 1993. Groundwater levels at the Adventure 28 well in St. Croix dropped to 22.63 feet below land surface as of April 17. This was the greatest depth since November 2016. Meanwhile, the month-to-date rainfall total at the airport of 0.56 inch was only 50% of normal precipitation. Similarly, the airport’s year-to-date rainfall total was 3.85 inches, which is only 59.4% of normal. SPI values at the 1 (-0.53) and 3 (-0.53) months are consistent with abnormally dry conditions, while the 6 (-1.28) and 12 (-1.08) month periods are indicative of moderate drought. Due to the little rain and groundwater impacts, the drought classification was changed to severe drought.
St. Thomas and St. John also continued in severe drought this week as they received no rain. The month-to-date rainfall total at St. Thomas airport was 1.52 inches or 105.6% of normal rainfall. However, the year-to-date rainfall of 4.01 inches was 60.1% of normal. SPI values for the 1 (0.03) and 6-month (-0.37) period was indicative of drought free conditions. On the other hand, SPI values for 3 (-0.69) and 12 month (-0.79) periods were indicative of abnormally dry conditions. The Grade School 3 Well had groundwater at 13.51 feet below land surface (as of April 17), which is also the greatest depth since August 2017. St. John’s month-to-date rainfall total at the Cruz Bay 1.6 E CoCoRaHs station was 0.57 inch and 1.18 inches at the Windswept Beach. SPI values for the 3 (-0.68), 6 (-0.55), and 12 (-0.62) months were indicative of abnormally dry conditions. Groundwater at the Susannaberg DPW 3 Well was 15.79 feet below surface.
Looking Ahead
A weather system moved across the Northeast as this USDM week ended and the new week began. During April 22-27, the western ridge will break down, allowing a couple weather systems to move across the CONUS. One will move across the South and Southeast at mid-week, while another moves into the West as the USDM week ends. Much of the CONUS is expected to receive 0.10-0.25 inch of precipitation, with 1.0-2.0 inches in the mountains of the Coastal, Cascade, and Sierra Nevada ranges and northern Rockies. But the heaviest precipitation will be from eastern Texas to South Carolina, and southeast Kansas to southern Illinois, where 1.0-3.0 inches is forecast to fall. An inch or more is expected across a broad area from eastern portions of Texas, Oklahoma, and Kansas, across the Ohio Valley, to the Mid-Atlantic coast; south to the Gulf of Mexico coast; and across New England. Temperatures are expected to be cooler than normal in the east as the Canadian air masses exit the CONUS, then moderate to near to warmer than normal CONUS-wide. The outlook for April 28-May 1 warmer than normal in the East and cooler than normal in the Pacific Northwest. Odds favor wetter-than-normal conditions in the Pacific Northwest; along the Mississippi, Ohio, and Tennessee Valleys; and in the Great Lakes; with below-normal precipitation in most of the southern Plains. In Alaska, odds favor below-normal precipitation across the state except the panhandle, warmer-than-normal temperatures in the west, and cooler-than-normal temperatures in the east. .

Innovation Snapshot
Our favourite sustainable innovations from the past year that we hope will inspire businesses around the globe to do more to help protect our planet in 2021.
We are firm believers of the idea that addressing the climate crisis and pursuing other sustainable initiatives is a win-win situation for businesses. Aside from the increased brand loyalty that accrues from aligning with activist values, climate change is poised to cost businesses an estimated €85 billion in the next five years.
Also, consider the B Corporation movement. This rigorous certification process ensures that organisations meet rigorous social and environmental standards that represent a genuine commitment to goals outside shareholder profit. But reaching such goals has numerous benefits as well, even adding much-needed resiliency for businesses weathering tumultuous times like the ones we’re in now.
According to one study, B Corps were 63 per cent more likely than other businesses of a similar size to make it through the last financial crisis. PWC also found that UK B Corps have reported average revenue growth of 14 per cent year-on-year since 2015.
With all of this in mind, we’re sharing 21 of our favourite sustainable innovations from the past year that we hope will inspire businesses around the globe to do more to help protect our planet in 2021 — and, in turn, help themselves.
1. TRULY COMPOSTABLE TAKEAWAY BOWLS
Due to consumer awareness of the problem of plastic waste, many restaurants have started to move towards more sustainable options, such as compostable fibre packaging. However, it was recently discovered that the moulded fibre food packages contain poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) which, when used to coat the paper-like surface, remain persistent in compost and can potentially end up in the soil, water or food. As a solution to the problem, restaurant chain Sweetgreen has partnered with Footprint, a company aimed at eliminating single-use plastic packaging, to launch new compostable to-go bowls. Sweetgreen explored other options for PFAS-free packaging but eventually decided to work with Footprint, making them the first restaurant chain to use the company’s packaging.
2. AN APPLIANCE RENTAL SERVICE MODEL
A product design student at London’s Southbank University has developed a model for an online platform, called Upkeep, that allows users to rent large household appliances. Of course, renting appliances has a long history, and is available almost everywhere, but the Upkeep rental service would operate on a subscription model, which is more unique. The designer, Dominika Ptach, proposes three levels of subscription – “Neo” for new appliances; “Denovo” for certified refurbished appliances; and “Care” to allow repair or safe disposal of users’ existing appliances.
3. A FULLY CIRCULAR RUNNING SHOE
French company Salomon has designed a pair of running shoes that are 100 per cent recyclable. The thread used to sew the shoes is the same material as the rest of the upper. The shoe’s upper, itself made from recycled polyester, can be recycled again into new thread for fabric, and the foam sole can be ground up and used in the brand’s ski boots. Thus, nothing ends in the landfill. In the future, it may even be possible to make soles out of recycled PET, so that the whole shoe would be made of a single material and would be even easier to recycle.
4. DESIGNER MANUFACTURES CLOTHING AS IT SELLS
Nigerian-born designer Lola Faturoti is known for her colourful, African-inspired designs. She had long wanted to produce denim clothing but was put off by the large order sizes needed, and the huge amounts of waste involved in printing on denim. Now, she is partnering with Resonance, a garment manufacturing company that is working to eliminate inventory in fashion, creating only the pieces that will be purchased. Faturoti uses Resonance’s cloud-based platform to print her designs on organic and biodegradable denim, using 40 per cent less ink and 50 per cent less water than conventional methods. Savings are made from the item being produced only after a customer has placed an order, eliminating the manufacturing of items that never sell.
5. ZERO WASTE GROCERY DELIVERY
US-based Zero Grocery has committed to only providing plastic-free groceries – the company buys in bulk and packs the food and other products into glass jars, boxes and reusable containers. Zero charges a delivery fee or a monthly membership. The company collects any empty containers from previous deliveries, which are sanitised and reused — a bit like a milkman for groceries.
6. NET-ZERO LIQUOR
The sustainable liquor company Mermaid is supporting carbon positive projects to offset its emissions. The first project actively promotes Blue Carbon initiatives, which are ocean-based projects to mitigate climate change by preserving carbon-capturing ecosystems. Mermaid gins and Mermaid Salt Vodka are already presented in plastic-free bottles which are 100 per cent recyclable: the stopper is made from sustainably sourced cork and wood and even the seal is plant-based and biodegradable.
7. A PAPER BOTTLE FOR ADULT BEVERAGES
Diageo, the company behind drinks brands such as Smirnoff, Guinness, Tanqueray and Captain Morgan, has joined with Unilever and PepsiCo to make a major investment in sustainable packaging technology. The rival companies have joined with venture management company Pilot Lite to launch sustainable packaging technology company Pulpex Limited, which has designed and developed a scalable and fully-recyclable paper-based drinks bottle. It is made from food-safe and sustainably sourced pulp. To prevent leaks, the contents are protected by a liner made from resin, which disintegrates once the bottle is empty. The cap will be made of aluminium, which can be recycled.
8. FOOD LABEL CHANGES PRICE AS EXPIRATION NEARS
As groceries reach their expiration date, supermarkets often relabel them with discount stickers – 20 per cent off, 40 per cent off, etc. But this relabelling can be time-consuming for staff and often leads to mistakes. To prevent this, three grad students at the National Taipei University of Technology have designed a better system. The Barcodiscount concept consists of colour-changing stickers, which display different discounts based on the timing of the expiration date. For example, when a packet of meat is 48 hours from expiration, the words 20 per cent off appear on the label, and when the meat is 24 hours from expiration, this is automatically replaced with the words 40 per cent off.
9. ENHANCED SUSTAINABLE PACKAGING TECH FOR RETAILERS
Finland-based MetsäBoard specializes in producing packaging solutions with the least possible environmental impact. The company’s paperboards, folding boxboards and white kraft liners, are all plastic-free, lightweight and easily recyclable — and said to consume less raw materials, reduce transport weight and produce less waste. The products are made of pure fresh fibres sourced from sustainably managed Northern European forests.
10. BREWERY BUYS A FOREST TO OFFSET CARBON
Scottish craft brewer BrewDog took a bold step towards becoming not just carbon neutral, but carbon negative. The company purchased 2,500 acres of forest in the Scottish Highlands. The land is currently used for grazing livestock, but BrewDog hopes to restore the area to native forest, allowing it to sequester around 300,000 tons of CO2.
11. BLOCKCHAIN MARKETPLACE RESCUES FABRIC FROM LANDFILL
Sales platform Queen of Raw uses blockchain and artificial intelligence to divert tonnes of those usable materials to other individuals and brands. Businesses wanting to work more sustainably use the company’s material exchange programme, MateriaMX, to identify areas of waste within supply chains. That stock is then automatically added to the Queen of Raw marketplace, ensuring that not only do businesses waste less, but they earn more.
12. COMPOSTABLE PLANT-BASED HOODIE
London-based clothing startup Vollebak has designed a hoodie from eucalyptus trees that is fully biodegradable and compostable within eight weeks. Made from pulped eucalyptus and beech wood that has been sourced from sustainably managed forests, the plant-based jumper achieves a mossy hue from being dyed with pomegranate peel.
13. BOOKING PLATFORM OFFSETS ALL CARBON FROM HOTEL STAYS
The Denmark-based, hotel booking platform Goodwings offers subscription-based access to more than one million hotels worldwide at wholesale rates. However, Goodwings is more than the average booking site, the company is a B Corp–certified member aiming to turn the hotel industry into a catalyst for sustainable change. With Goodwings, all hotel stays are 100 per cent carbon compensated, supporting people and the planet for free.
14. HANDBAGS THAT CONSUMERS ASSEMBLE AT HOME
Japanese studio, Nendo, has designed a collection of handbags for the startup Italian online platform, Up To You Anthology, which customers can self-assemble at home. Each bag in the Mai collection is made from single sheets of laser-cut leather, in a net-style format. Its name comes from the Japanese word “ichi-mai”, which translates to “one-sheet”. This straightforward design has simplified the manufacturing process and minimised the inventory and shipping costs.
15. RECYCLING COMPLIANCE PLATFORM FOR E-COMMERCE
Ecosistant, a Berlin-based consulting agency for recycling compliance, has launched a platform enabling online retailers to perform EU-wide packaging licensing digitally. An algorithm-based process makes it swift and simple to fulfil packaging compliance obligations, with greater financial appeal compared to conventional CSR consultants. The development is led by company founders Andreas Landes and Johannes Kohlmann.
16. TRAINERS MADE FROM RECYCLED TIRE SOLES
The French startup, Off the Hook (OTH), is a unisex, sustainable, trainer brand. These unique shoes have soles made from recycled, world-travelled tires. Moreover, each pair is tattooed with GPS coordinates referring to an unusual place. One tire is recycled for every three pairs of shoes produced by OTH.
17. PLATFORM HELPS MERCHANTS CUT FOOD WASTE
Phenix has created a real-time, reliable connection between supermarkets and organisations in need of food donations. While originally a purely digital platform, Phenix has grown in line with the increasing demand of their partnered stores and charities. There are benefits for both too — shops using the platform not only reduce their waste disposal costs but also gain a tax deduction on the food they donate – from which Phenix collects a commission.
18. BREWERY BURNS IRON AS A GREEN FUEL ALTERNATIVE
A new green fuel alternative has emerged that involves burning metal powder. When iron powder is ground very fine, it burns readily at high temperatures and releases energy as it oxidises. No carbon is emitted in this process — only iron oxide, which is regenerated back into iron powder when electricity is applied. Netherlands-based Swinkels Family Brewers have recently become the first business in the world to put this process to work at an industrial scale.
19. CARBON OFFSETTING PLATFORM PROVIDES FULLY TRACEABLE CONTRIBUTIONS
New Zealand technology company CarbonClick recently introduced its e-commerce platform for businesses. Rather than require every business to research, build and track its own carbon offsetting programme, CarbonClick provides high-quality, internationally-vetted and fully traceable projects that support the work to reverse climate change. Businesses add a CarbonClick option to their checkout processes, allowing customers to decide how much of their purchases to offset. Individuals can set up a monthly subscription to cover the cost of the carbon emissions of their regular activities.
20. SMART PACKAGING BOX HANDLES 1,000 SHIPMENTS ON SINGLE CHARGE
Smart, sustainable packaging company, LivingPackets, has partnered with ePaper technology business, E Ink, to provide E Ink displays for their invention: THE BOX — a connected delivery box made of an incredibly rigid material and that is designed to be used over and over again. THE BOX can run for up to a 1,000 shipments on a single charge before it gets refurbished and sent out for another 1,000 shipments. The paperless label makes addressing shipments quick and easy and allows businesses to accommodate last-minute amendments to delivery locations.
21. PLATFORM ESTIMATES CARBON EMISSIONS OF PLANNED BUILDINGS
Architecture and design studio Feilden Clegg Bradley Studios (FCBS) is working to make this easier with their development of a free tool called FCBS Carbon, which helps architects to estimate the whole-life carbon emissions of a planned building. Whole-life carbon emissions refer to the CO2 emitted during the entire lifespan of a building. Knowing the whole-life emissions can allow architects to fine-tune their designs in order to produce fewer emissions. The FCBS Carbon tool helps architects to quickly and easily produce a spreadsheet of a building’s potential environmental impact. Architects can then see how changes to plans and materials affect the carbon footprint.

Growing a business requires the right intellectual capital, carefully selected strategic partnerships, and products and/or services with strong marketplace demand. Beyond these fundamentals, sustaining growth requires a strong operational foundation – to reduce the risks to the business over time.
One of my clients has been in business for more than 15 years. They are a technology company with a strong value proposition and service offering. But while the business model is scalable, it lacks a strong foundation from which to confidently invest in its growth. The CEO knows that business revenue can exceed five times its existing base of $250 million (that is profitable), but there is a lack of top talent, inconsistent operational efficiencies and overall leadership that is afraid to face growth head-on. This slows down growth and makes it difficult to consistently service clients, design a workplace culture that can help employees thrive, build the right teams to increase productivity, and form the external partnerships to make the right strategic decisions to create a billion dollar organization.
One might say that being a $250 million business is good enough and – for the aforementioned reasons – it should be sold to an organization that has the readiness to grow and sustain it, rather than investing good money without knowing the probability for favorable ROI.
This scenario is all too common and many CEOs – whether small business or Fortune 500 – are often faced with this dilemma. Unfortunately, many business leaders think only about the here and now – rather than focusing on the potential for future growth and sustainability. They find themselves growing complacent – rather than thinking about how to solve for the issues at hand. Building a strong business model and value proposition is not enough; if operational infrastructure, decision-making and leadership are weak, this does not provide for a sustainable long-term growth solution.
Before your business can grow and sustain its momentum, you must take action in support of the following six things to assure your company builds a strong foundation for long term success:
1. Top Talent
Without the right people, a business can’t grow and it certainly makes it difficult to sustain momentum over time. Business is about people and without the right people a business can’t grow and mature. Oftentimes, this requires an organization to refresh its talent pool in support of the organization’s business model and the unique needs of its clients.
Reassess your talent and ask yourself this question: Is your current talent pool servicing your clients and identifying the right opportunities to create and sustain business growth? Are they enabling their passionate pursuits in search of endless possibilities in their work? Take this quiz and see if your teams are able to effectively see, sow, grow and share opportunities in their work. If you score over 35, you are in good shape. If not, you have some work to do.
2. Operational Efficiencies
Efficiencies drive costs down and embed a mindset within the workplace culture that makes people sensitive to costs and ways to streamline how the organization communicates, operates and connects the dots of opportunities. This helps to assure that activities within the organization are in alignment with the needs of the business to create and sustain growth.
The best way to create operational efficiencies is to assure that the workplace culture supports the tools to drive efficiencies within the organization – by design – not by accident. To learn more, here are six organizational values to create and sustain growth through an efficiencies-driven mindset. In the end, your organization must embrace a cultural promise that stands by the following motto: Success comes most to those who are surrounded by people who want their success to continue.
3. Prospecting the Right Clients
Entrepreneur is no longer just a business term anymore, it’s a way of life. You must always embrace an entrepreneurial attitude to see and seize the right opportunities – especially those previously unseen or that others don’t see at all. This is why you must embrace an entrepreneurial spirit when prospecting the right clients –to assure the business not only grows, but sustains itself over time.
Generating sales is all relative. If you are selling to clients whose business needs are not sustainable – this represents a zero sum game. If you don’t have the right mechanisms in place to prospect the right clients, you will find it difficult to sustain growth – let alone grow at all.
Embracing an entrepreneurial attitude allows you to see beyond the obvious and spot the best clients in support of your business model. This keeps acquisition costs low and assures client relationships are mutually beneficial and goals are in alignment.
4. Sound Decision Making
Problem solving is the essence of what leaders exist to do. As leaders, the goal is to minimize the occurrence of problems – which means we must be courageous enough to tackle them head-on. We must be resilient in our quest to create and sustain momentum for the organization and people we serve.
When an organization has the protocols, the standard operating procedures in place to solve problems and make sound decisions, they have enabled the ability to anticipate the unexpected to assure that circumstances don’t force their hand.
It’s difficult to sustain growth when you operate in an environment where people are constantly being overly reactive, rather than proactive. Sound decision making is a matter of good judgment and the ability to identify good timing and depth – to assure that momentum is created and never disrupted.
5. Great Leadership
The most successful leaders are instinctual decision makers and thus have the circular vision to see opportunity in everything. Having done it – made decisions – so many times throughout their careers, great leaders will become immune to pressure situations and extremely intuitive about casting strategic, long-term plans for the future.
Sustaining business growth demands leadership that can see the glass as half full – even when everyone else is seeing it as half empty.
6. Don’t Be Afraid to Grow
To sustain growth, you must have the mindset of embracing risk as your best friend. The moment that employees are not encouraged to share their ideas and ideals, it becomes difficult to take ownership of the needs of the business – and the marketplace quickly begins to pass you by.
Sustaining growth requires you to share your momentum with others. It demands that you have the best interests of others on your team, and colleagues throughout the organization, at heart. Driving sustainable growth can never happen alone. It not only demands a strong team, but collaborative departments/business units that together make up a strong ecosystem with the right intellectual capital.
When diversity of thought is embraced, it serves as a powerful unifier to leverage unique thinking and the opportunities associated with it – to sustain growth.
When sustainability becomes part of your organizational central ethos, you’re not only better able to sustain business growth – you’re able to remain five steps ahead of the game. To get there, leaders must be potent pioneers — blazing new paths few would see through to the end, let alone go down in the first place. This can fuel opportunities previously unseen and infuse the workplace and employee engagement with new-found purpose and excitement – further sustaining the growth of the business.
Follow me @GlennLlopis. Join our LinkedIn group here. . A ranking of the organizations doing the most to embrace sustainable business practices was revealed Tuesday at the World Economic Forum annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland. Compiled by Canadian research firm Corporate Knights since 2005, the Global 100 list ranks corporations with revenue in excess of $1 billion based on key metrics of sustainability, among them carbon footprint and gender diversity.
Topping this year’s list is Denmark-based renewable energy provider Ørsted. The first electricity company to earn the distinction of No. 1 climbed 69 spots since 2018 thanks, in part, to the way in which it has reinvented its business model over the past decade. “They completely revamped their core business from being a pretty coal-intensive utility to being almost a pure-play renewable power provider,” says Toby Heaps, cofounder and CEO of Corporate Knights.
It’s no wonder that Ørsted topped the list: Divesting in fossil fuels and investing in offshore wind power helped the organization reduce carbon emissions by 83%, and half the company’s Global 100 sustainability score is dependent on revenue earned from products and services that benefit the environment or society. “The transformation has now come to a point where the vast majority of our energy production comes from renewable sources,” says Henrik Poulsen, CEO and president of Ørsted.
The company makes environmental sustainability a priority. “We believe it’s quite urgent that we respond to the climate emergency, and it has been the driving ambition of our company to contribute to a world that runs entirely on green energy,” Poulsen says. “We’ve been quite forceful and had a lot of urgency transforming our company because we fundamentally think it’s time to take real action.”
As part of its transformation, the business has created 20 sustainability programs, including a decarbonization initiative with a goal of getting Ørsted coal-free by 2023. The company’s offshore wind farms bring green power to more than 13 million people, and the aim is to reach 50 million by 2030.
Nearly half the companies on Corporate Knights’ list are based in Europe (29 are headquartered in North America, while 18 call Asia home), including Chr. Hansen Holding, which this year is No. 2 after claiming the No. 1 spot last year. The Denmark-based bioscience company develops natural solutions for the food, beverage, nutritional, pharmaceutical and agricultural industries. Chr. Hansen uses “good” bacteria to ensure that food stays fresh as it moves from farm to market.
Rounding out the top three for the second year in a row is Neste Oyj. Some 25% of the Finnish oil refining and marketing company’s revenue comes from its biofuel business, making it a major supplier of renewable jet fuel in Europe, and 38% of the company’s board is made up of women.
The organizations that make up this list have made significant strides toward sustainability, but there’s still much work to be done, and it’s in their best interest as businesses to do it. “The big takeaway when looking at Ørsted and the other companies doing well is how fast the pace is speeding up in terms of the growth in green, clean markets,” Heaps says. “In this age of climate and carbon constraints and an emerging climate economy, these companies are positioned to succeed.” . As Kermit the Frog lamented, “it’s not easy being green.” However, with scientists releasing increasingly alarming evidence pointing to rising sea levels, hotter summers and the global community’s escalating carbon footprint, “being green” is frankly no longer good enough.
Eco-friendly standards that were hip and progressive in the 1980s and '90s now seem to barely scratch the surface of what’s needed to shut down this greenhouse emissions time bomb. Instead, today’s focus needs to be on sustainability, the idea of putting into place long-term, sustainable practices that will help alleviate further damage to the planet.
From a business perspective, sustainability shouldn’t just be another progressive marketing strategy but a rallying cry that more and more companies, big and small, need to get behind if large scale change is to be effective.
Not only are measures like LED lighting, ride-sharing initiatives and green data centers good for the environment as well as the health and well-being your employees and local community, but the World Economic Forum sees parallels between eco-innovation and increases to a business’ profit margins.
“Consumers, in general, prefer a sustainable business or product. Fortunately, there are plenty of businesses who took sustainability to a new level, and they [are] profiting from it tremendously. Almost all successful and profitable businesses have real sustainability measures in place, some have it even certified,” Guido Bauer, the CEO of Green Globe, a Los Angeles-based company that provides sustainability certification for the travel and tourism industries in more than 80 countries, told me in an email. Bauer is one of the many eco-thought leaders I have long admired and have tried to emulate throughout my career as a high-tech entrepreneur.
Unfortunately, there are still many companies that have not yet taken sustainability seriously, according to Bauer, “as they are unaware of the advantages.” Others, especially small businesses, may shy away from implementing eco-measures in an effort to pinch pennies.
The way I see it, companies, no matter how small, can’t afford not to be sustainable, particularly those like my web and app development shop that rely heavily on one of the world’s biggest polluters -- the internet. (A recent study from the Department of Energy’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory found that U.S. data centers use around 70 billion kilowatt-hours annually.)
Bottom line: Sustainable business practices are your social responsibility and, if you stay within your means, not as costly as you might imagine.
Looking to Apple’s massive new headquarters (compared, by Steve Jobs, to a spaceship) or Tesla’s sprawling 5.5 million-square-foot Gigafactory under development in the Nevada desert, both to be powered by solar energy, for inspiration will likely be disheartening if you don’t have a couple of billion dollars to play around with.
Facebook’s cool data center 70 miles south of the Arctic Circle in northern Sweden may also not be within the parameters of your budget, but emulating these international giants, shouldn’t be your endgame.
I recommend starting small: recycle your waste, use tap water instead of bottles, take advantage of natural light in office spaces. How many of these things do you already do? Now imagine if you were continuously thinking of new ways to expand your sustainability goals.
My development team, based in a BREEAM-certified office complex, actively recycles, uses tap water and glass kitchenware. We were awarded for our efforts, taking home both Office of the Year and Smart Office of the Year accolades. We were also nominated for Healthy Office of the Year.
These are all admirable achievements that certainly have our local business community and clients talking. But my first thought upon winning was: What can we be doing better? This is the type of thinking I believe will help take companies to the next level of social responsibility.
“Sustainability concentrates on energy/water/waste, community, heritage and corporate social responsibility. Doing well in all four categories places a company into a whole different light with consumers,” Bauer, an advocate of certified sustainability, told me. “According to our in-house data, certified companies reduce operating cost by 6.8% per year and are able to reach on average a million more consumers with communicating sustainability in the correct way.”
A recent global consumer survey by Unilever (a British-Dutch consumer goods company behind such brands as Lipton, Ben & Jerry’s, Dove and Knorr) cites a $1 trillion market opportunity for businesses that effectively market themselves as eco-innovators. In fact, 21% of those polled by Unilever said, “they would support brands that clearly conveyed the sustainability aspects of their products through their marketing and packaging.”
I can attest to this. Over the last decade, I’ve been meeting more and more clients who are keenly interested in sustainable practices. In fact, some are only willing to do business with companies that actively practice sustainability. Every year, I make it a goal to expand my agency’s eco-efforts beyond the office, taking cues from my own engineers as well as former clients, like Zkipster, an event management app that helps cut back on needless invitation paper trails.
In addition to our waste recycling and energy saving initiatives we’ve implemented at all our offices, my company has also developed a food delivery startup that leverages bicycles instead of cars and recently co-founded a new urban bike-sharing platform, billed to be one of the most eco-friendly transport options on the European market when it launches this fall.
Sustainability is more than just a shrewd business move that companies can promote on their websites and in their marketing literature, among other avenues. It is an important issue for all of us as human being and stewards of this world -- it’s the only one we've got. Interplanetary colonization, despite the hype it’s been getting from the likes of Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking, is still just science fiction. If it one day becomes a reality, great -- but in the meanwhile, let’s fix what we have, one recycle bin and data center at a time. .

Over the past few years, MBA programs across the globe have ramped up the level of specialized sustainability teaching, with many schools incorporating sustainability measures into their mission.
MBAs with a concentration in sustainability use the trialed and tested framework of a conventional MBA while also having a specific focus on the intersection of sustainability and business success and ethics, all in an effort to advance sustainability principles.
It’s not solely focused on the environment. It also tackles social sustainability and social impact.
As businesses become more conscious of how they affect the world, businesses are on the lookout for employees who are more able to promote sustainable measures.
Here are some of the world’s top business schools preparing graduates to be ethical, sustainable leaders.
Warwick Business School’s full-time MBA program gives students the opportunity to visit Vancouver – regarded as the world’s greenest city – to learn about sustainable business.
There is also a Business and Sustainability module which introduces the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals, as well as modules like the Economics of Wellbeing, Human Resource Management and Corporate Responsibility.
Students can also make the most of learning about different cultures on international modules in India, Mexico, Brazil, or China.
The Exeter MBA can be undertaken full-time in over 12 months, or as an executive part-time option over 24-36 months. The program focuses on sustainability, purposeful leadership, innovation and technology, so graduates will transform not only themselves, but the world around them.
Stuart Robinson, Program Director of The Exeter MBA says, “The creation of sustainable practice is now in the mainstream of industrial, societal, and technological progress globally, so we are delighted to be recognized as an MBA that offers students the skills and knowledge to take this forward in their careers.”
Students attending Sloan interested in social and environmental impact could look into MIT’s sustainability certificate (only open to masters-level students as an add-on to existing degree programs).
The program also involves the Sustainable Business Laboratory, where students work in teams on problems faced by real firms attempting to advance sustainability strategies. Coursework includes a sustainability capstone class during your final term, along with a variety of sustainability electives.
INSEAD is incorporating sustainability into their INSEAD MBA curriculum, with two courses standing out – Business Sustainability and the SDG Bootcamp.
These courses enable students to analyze, improve and create innovative business models that are more profitable and sustainable.
The SDG Bootcamp is an intense workshop focusing on problem framing, ideation and prototyping. It encourages students to address critical real-world problems in line with UN Sustainable Development Goals.
Fuqua’s Client Consulting Practicum (FCCP) – an experiential learning program – offers teams of students the opportunity to work on sustainability issues for client companies and non-profits.
The business school also boasts an award-winning research and education enter, the Center for the Advancement of Social Entrepreneurship (CASE). The center helps organizations and leaders with the necessary business skills to promote and achieve social change.
CASE sponsors i3, a professional online training program for direct impact investing. Similarly, the center funds fellowships which enables students to trial social impact careers through internships without financial struggles.
Located in the Spanish capital Madrid, IE Business School pushes to incorporate innovation throughout the school’s ethos. The school offers a number of appropriate sustainability courses, and also holds an annual Social Responsibility Forum that explores CSR-related issues.
HBS was in fact one of the business schools to build research in the CSR space through its Social Enterprise Initiative. Many of the MBA program’s core curriculum classes also integrate CSR case studies.
Johnson’s Center for Sustainable Global Enterprise – which launched in 2003 – publishes relevant sustainability and CSR research. If they so wish, two-year MBA students can choose a concentration in Sustainable Global Enterprise, as well as a company project focusing on CSR topics.
Students enrolled in the SGE immersion work in multidisciplinary teams on consulting-type assignments with real firms that are focused on strategic initiatives exploring new business opportunities related to sustainability.
The core curriculum on RSM’s MBA program offers courses including Business, Society, and Sustainable Development, which places a strong focus on CSR and sustainability.
The school produces a range of research in the sustainability field, but more importantly, RSM incorporated the UN Global Compact’s Principles for Responsible Management Education into their MBA curriculum.

investopedia,https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sustainability.asp ,"What Is Sustainability?
Sustainability focuses on meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs. The concept of sustainability is composed of three pillars: economic, environmental, and social—also known informally as profits, planet, and people. Increasingly, companies are making public commitments to sustainability through actions like reducing waste, investing in renewable energy, and supporting organizations that work toward a more sustainable future.
Key Takeaways
- Sustainability focuses on meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs.
- Investors can be wary of companies that commit to sustainability. Although the optics can be beneficial to share price, investors worry about companies being transparent with their earnings results.
- Big brands often make pledges to sustainability, but it often takes a long time to achieve sustainability goals.
How Sustainability Works
Sustainability encourages businesses to frame decisions in terms of environmental, social, and human impact for the long-term, rather than on short-term gains such as next quarter's earnings report. It influences them to consider more factors than simply the immediate profit or loss involved. Increasingly, companies have issued sustainability goals such as commitment to zero-waste packaging by a certain year, or to reduce overall emissions by a certain percentage.
These companies can achieve their sustainability needs by cutting emissions, lowering their energy usage, sourcing products from fair-trade organizations, and ensuring their physical waste is disposed of properly and with as small a carbon footprint as possible.
Challenges Around Sustainability
The push for sustainability is evident in areas such as energy generation where the focus has been on finding new deposits to outpace the drawdown on existing reserves. Some electricity companies, for example, now publicly state goals for energy generation from sustainable sources such as wind, hydropower, and solar.
Sustainability emerged as a component of corporate ethics in response to perceived public discontent over the long-term damage caused by a focus on short-term profits.
However, moving toward sustainable production is often a complex process for companies. By basing decisions on longer timelines, some of the higher upfront investments in efficiency and renewable sources are easier to justify. Investors have had to adjust their expectations for returns because a company that commits to the sustainable development of resources may have more modest earnings results in the near term.
Many companies have been criticized for exploiting cost-cutting measures such as offshoring production to obtain cheaper labor. This practice, although beneficial for the bottom line, often comes at the price of compromised worker safety and security. One of the starkest examples of how offshoring can go wrong was the 2013 Savar factory collapse in Bangladesh, in which more than 1,100 people died. Other ways of cutting costs can also damage sustainability: For example, a factory that allows its waste to flow into a nearby body of water to avoid the short-term costs of proper disposal can cause expensive and significant long-term environmental damage.
Many of the companies that are most sensitive to consumer backlash, usually retailers and restaurants, have announced sustainability plans to reduce carbon footprints, packaging waste, and animal suffering.
This has caused some investors to shy away from sustainable investments—at least until companies become more transparent with their financial and business practices. . ",False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False

The role of cross-sector partnerships to break away from the vicious cycles of place-based dynamics in innovation ecosystems
The purpose of this article is to advance theory development by conceptualising how place (detachment) attachment of actors’ leads to (vicious) virtuous innovation ecosystems and how cross-sector partnerships (CSPs) carry the potential to break away from the vicious cycles of place-ecosystem dynamics. To do so, we synthesise existing knowledge on innovation ecosystems, spaces, places, and CSPs, define the main constructs (health of innovation ecosystems, place attachment-detachment, CSPs as herding spaces) and introduce the relationships between these seemingly disparate constructs in a conceptual model that brings them together. Our conceptual model demonstrates the recursive relationships between place (detachment) attachment and (un)healthy innovation ecosystems, which we characterise as vicious and virtuous cycles. We emphasise the role of CSPs to break away from the vicious dynamics of place-innovation ecosystem dynamics and explain the conditions in which CSPs carry such potential. We also generate propositions in alignment with our conceptual model and provide new paths for future research by raising new questions about the platial dynamics of innovation ecosystems and the role of CSPs in these dynamics. We support our conceptual model with two illustrative cases that exemplify vicious and virtuous place-innovation ecosystem dynamics.

Guest blog for Business and Society by Leena Lankoski and Minna Halme.
Perinteinen kapitalistinen ajatus, että yrityksen tehtävänä on ainoastaan tuottaa voittoa osakkeenomistajilleen, tuntuu nykyään suunnilleen yhtä 1900-lukuiselta kuin lankapuhelin.
Kuuluisassa Kasvun rajat –raportissa (Meadows ym., 1972) todettiin jo lähes 50 vuotta sitten, että luonnonvarojen tuhlaileva käyttö ei voi jatkua loputtomiin.
Valitettavasti 2020-luvulle tultaessa on käynyt ilmeiseksi, että ihmiskunta on ollut hidas reagoimaan. Materiaalienkäytön ja päästöjen kasvu kielii siitä, että todellinen radikaali muutos vaatii aikaa. Näinhän se menee. Hammaslääkäriinkin vaivautuu vasta, kun tarpeeksi kivistää.
Onneksi löytyy myös kosolti kestäviä edelläkävijäyrityksiä, joiden innovaatiot ovat parhaillaan tehokasta juurihoitoa luonnonvarojen käytön kasvun kanssa kipuilevalle ihmiskunnalle. Näitä edelläkävijäyrityksiä löytyy tekstiilialalla esimerkiksi vastuullisten yritysten listasta, jota Finix-hankkeen tutkijat kokosivat koronakevään aikana #kestävävaate-kampanjassa.

businessnewsdaily,https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/5102-green-business-ideas.html ,"Do you want to start a business and protect the environment at the same time? These green business ideas help you do just that.
Today, consumers are just as interested in corporate social responsibility (CSR) as they are in a company's products and services. This is especially good news for eco-minded entrepreneurs.
We've outlined 23 eco-friendly, green industry business ideas for making money and saving the planet at the same time.
What is a green industry business?
A green industry business is one that uses sustainable materials to make its products. Green industry businesses aim to use as little water, energy and raw materials as possible while cutting carbon emissions, or it finds ways to utilize these materials in renewable and eco-friendly ways. This business approach minimizes the company's strain on natural resources and contributions to climate change. In some cases, if waste is generated, it is reused as energy or raw material.
What is a green business model?
With a traditional business model, a company outlines raw material budgets, design processes, and service delivery or product distribution methods. A green business model, while ensuring ample revenue, prioritizes minimizing the company's environmental impact instead of maximizing its profit. It may involve restricted use of fossil fuels while emphasizing power supplied by solar panels and other approaches to drastically reduce energy consumption.
How do I start a green business?
As consumers have come to care about CSR, a greater number of green businesses have emerged, but the problems that climate change poses require many solutions. Thus, to start a green business, first identify an eco-friendly service that nobody in your market currently offers. Then think of similarly eco-minded people you know whom you could ask to join your team.
As you launch your green business, change your lifestyle to reflect the values and services of your business.
What companies are eco-friendly?
Eco-friendly companies may include outdoor apparel brands, businesses that make reusable plastic bottles, eco-friendly cleaning companies, businesses that install solar panels, a local recycling business, and many other potential ventures. If you're looking to start your own eco-friendly, green industry business, consider any of the 23 ideas below.
1. Ink refill business
Starting an ink-refill business can not only be a highly profitable decision, it can be an environmentally conscious one, too. You might question whether refilling ink cartridges truly helps the environment considering the amount of paper that is wasted each year. However, by reusing old ink cartridges, there is less nonbiodegradable waste accumulating in landfills. Paper is still necessary in the business world, but empty ink containers are not.
2. Environmental publications
If you love to write, start your own environmentally minded publication. Your actions can make a big difference in the world. By debunking popular myths and sharing the truth about the world we live in, you can help consumers rethink how their actions affect the planet.
3. Green finance
Green finance focuses on supporting local, community-level projects with an emphasis on sustainable, ecologically friendly agriculture. Green finance is also typically concerned with providing educational opportunities, funding for artistic endeavors and projects that support local ecology.
Green finance is preoccupied with social profitability. While monetary profit remains important, the goal of green finance is to support beneficial projects that provide value to the local community and ecology.
4. Eco-friendly retail
Consumer rewards programs are popular among retailers, and e-commerce site EcoPlum is no exception. With every purchase, customers earn EcoChipz, which are redeemable for either rewards or a donation to various environmental causes. Each product sold also carries a third-party green certification or an equivalent eco label.
Besides selling sustainably sourced products, EcoPlum produces educational content, including monthly columns by industry experts, local green business listings, recycling information, eco tips, and book and video recommendations. If you're considering opening a retail store, consider partnering with a company that has similar motives and values as you and your customers.
5. Sustainable construction materials
You might not think of construction as sustainable, but some companies now provide recycled materials for use in projects like infrastructure repair.
Axion, for example, with its eco-friendly products, hopes to change the way companies think about rebuilding America's infrastructure. The company's railroad ties and pilings are made from recycled plastic from consumer and industrial uses rather than nonsustainable materials like steel and concrete. Axion is currently working with major partners like Long Island Rail Road to improve infrastructure safely and sustainably in the United States.
6. Organic catering
A great way for eco-friendly foodies to share their passion for food and the environment is to start an organic catering company. By catering local events and business luncheons with foods containing organic and locally grown ingredients, free-range meats, and vegan, gluten-free, and paleo meal options, you'll appeal to nature lovers and health and wellness enthusiasts alike.
Be sure, though, to minimize the impact on the environment by avoiding plastic and paper goods as much as possible and composting food waste.
7. Eco-friendly beauty salon
If cosmetology is your passion, start a beauty business that's Mother Nature-approved. Organic and vegan hair and beauty products are popping up everywhere. A way to make this trend work for you is to open an eco-friendly beauty salon. You can open a hair salon that uses all-natural shampoos and conditioners or a nail salon that uses environmentally friendly and vegan polishes and spa treatments.
8. Eco-friendly landscaping
Professional landscaping may make your lawn and garden look nice, but all of that maintenance isn't necessarily great for the environment. With some eco-friendly advice and know-how, you can help homeowners make their yards literally and figuratively greener. SheKnows recommends synthetic turf, drought-resistant plants and strategically placed trees for a lawn that saves water, energy, and money.
9. Sustainable event planning
Whether they're big or small, meetings and events can generate large amounts of waste and consume valuable resources. Green event planners use their expertise and event-planning skills to find eco-friendly venues, materials, and accommodations.
Sustainable event management benefits more than just the planet. According to the Sustainable Events Guide, there are financial advantages, plus it generates a positive image for event organizers, vendors and stakeholders while raising awareness, and inspiring change in the community.
10. Bicycle repair and refurbishing
Biking short distances instead of driving is better for the environment and your health. Like most modes of transportation, bicycles occasionally need a tune-up.
You could be the expert cyclists come to when their bikes need repairing or maintenance. If you have some extra space, you could purchase inexpensive older bikes, fix them up and sell them for a profit.
11. Handmade all-natural/organic products
Soaps, cosmetics and cleaning products are just a few of the household products that can be made using common organic materials.
Sure, anyone can find a recipe for a sugar scrub or vinegar-based cleaning solution and do it themselves, but if you package and sell them in sets, your customers conveniently have those all-natural products at their fingertips. Local markets and events are a good place to sell, or you could start an online store.
12. Eco-consulting
Are you an expert on green living? Start an eco-consulting service. Consultants evaluate homes and offices, and offer solutions to make them more environmentally friendly.
You could advise clients on switching their home appliances to more energy-efficient machines or implement a recycling program. To further boost your credibility, become a certified eco-consultant.
13. Farmers market vendor
Thanks to the organic movement, those with a green thumb have a golden opportunity to earn money by selling non-GMO, pesticide-free produce at their local farmers market.
Selling naturally grown fruits and vegetables gives you a distinct advantage over competing growers who use conventional farming methods, including pesticides. You may have to be approved and/or get certified by your local board of health first before you can begin selling.
14. Green housekeeping services
For working parents, cleaning the house can be at the bottom of the to-do list. Market yourself as the green solution to their housekeeping woes by offering services that range from light dusting to heavy-duty chores like cleaning the kitchen and bathroom, using only approved all-natural and eco-friendly cleaning products.
Charge an hourly rate or create your own service packages for a flat fee. Remember, your clients are giving you access to their homes. Build a trustworthy reputation with people you know first before advertising to strangers.
15. 'Upcycled' furniture
Don't throw out your old, broken furniture. With basic templates and access to power tools, you can break down and reassemble chairs, tables and dressers into new pieces that you can paint and sell. Shelving and storage units are easy to make from wood scraps, and depending on the item, you might even be able to fully restore a unique and valuable piece of furniture.
Alternatively, you could reupholster old chairs and couches, giving them new life. Buying secondhand doesn't just save money, it also helps the environment.
16. Green franchises
Want to run a business with a solid brand and customer base already in place? Investing in a franchise might be the answer. While franchising might call to mind fast-food joints and hotel chains, there are many eco-friendly franchise businesses. Visit this green franchise directory for a list of opportunities.
17. Secondhand store
New things are typically expensive, and pretty soon, those costs add up. For example, a new book could cost $15 to $30, while a used book usually costs only a couple of dollars.
Opening a secondhand store not only saves your customers money, it's better for the environment. Instead of tossing a perfectly good item into the trash, encourage consumers to donate their used items to you so another person can get value out of that item. You can sell used clothes, coats, books, kitchen appliances and furniture.
18. Green consulting
Whether it's cutting energy costs or reducing their carbon footprint, the pressure for businesses to adopt green practices is high, and it's only going to grow.
Business sustainability consultant Barbara Englehart said there are numerous benefits for companies that go green, including reduced costs, risks and liabilities, and increased employee retention and productivity.
""This is all quite new in the business world, and companies need help,"" Englehart told Business News Daily. ""They weren't teaching sustainability in business schools five or 10 years ago.""
19. Solar panel installation
Many green-minded homeowners have installed solar panels on their homes, and many more would like. If you know how to do this, offer this service in your area.
20. Eco-friendly cleaning
Common cleaning products contain chemicals that contribute to pollution, and harm people and pets that come in contact with them. Starting an eco-friendly cleaning business counters this problem. Your eco-friendly cleaning business can exclusively use nontoxic products or use brands that minimize their use of single-use plastics. You can further decrease your company's environmental impact by reusing greywater whenever possible.
21. Reusable plastic bottles
Single-use plastics are indisputably a leading cause for concern among environmentalists. Offer people a way to drink water on the go without contributing to plastic pollution by launching a green industry business that designs, produces and sells reusable plastic bottles. Explore using alternative materials such as metal or glass, bottles made from recycled plastic, or renewable plastics from materials like corn starch or sawdust.
22. Environmental impact and carbon emissions lessons
Many people aren't aware of just how much carbon emissions their daily activities produce and the impact those activities have on the environment. Offer classes to educate the public about how driving, using air conditioning in the summer, leaving lights on unnecessarily, flying and other activities contribute to carbon emissions. You can also teach people how to reduce the environmental impact of these activities.
23. Local eco-friendly recycling business
Chances are that your town's department of public works oversees a public recycling program, but many experts say that what you put in your recycling bin doesn't always get recycled. Some municipalities don't accept all types of recyclable containers, while others may not thoroughly sort the collected recycling. Open an eco-friendly local recycling business to guarantee your community that their goods are recycled.

Millions of Americans are not getting the second doses of their Covid-19 vaccines, and their ranks are growing.

So, what we really need is a study that looks at the degree to which people actually get re-infected, not more studies that look at antibodies. Once we have that, we can do a comparison with the results of the vaccine trials, and then we will finally have a reasonably good estimate of whether prior infection or vaccination provides a higher level of immunity, or if they are equivalent. That is now exactly what we have, thanks to a study that was recently published in The Lancet.
This was a cohort study carried out in the UK that recruited 25,661 NHS hospital workers and then followed them for an average seven months. The study was funded by the UK government. Participants were divided in to two cohorts, a covid positive cohort and a covid negative cohort. The purpose of the study was to see what proportion of people in each cohort went on to develop covid-19. The data were collected during the second half of 2020.
Everyone who had or had previously had a positive antibody test or PCR test for covid-19 at the beginning of the study was placed in to the covid positive cohort, and everyone else was placed in to the covid negative cohort. The covid positive cohort contained 8,278 participants at the beginning of the study, while the covid negative cohort contained 17,383.
[…]
Over the course of 2,047,113 days of follow-up in the covid positive group, there were 78 cases of symptomatic covid-19 (by which we mean a positive test + at least one symptom).
Over the course of 2,971,436 days of follow-up in the covid negative group, there were 1,369 cases of symptomatic covid-19.
This works out to a relative risk reduction 0f 92%. For comparison, the Pfizer vaccine trial reported a reduction of 95%, the Moderna trial reported an reduction of 94%, the Astra-Zeneca trial reported a reduction of 70%, and the Johnson&Johnson trial reported a reduction of 67%.
So, on the face of it, prior infection is equivalent to the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines in terms of the level of protection offered, and much better than the Astra-Zeneca vaccine and J&J vaccine. In light of this, it seems completely unnecessary for people who have had covid to get the vaccine. In fact, if the goal of governments is to get their populations to herd immunity as quickly as possible, it would make more sense to tell people who have had confirmed covid-19 that they don’t need to get vaccinated. Vaccinating people who have already had covid-19 means delaying vaccination of people who haven’t had it, which means delaying the onset of herd immunity.
But read it all.
How many times have we heard this? That above everything else human behaviour is the primary driver of covid. That every minor and major blip on the chart is because we misbehaved. Every dip is because we listened to the “experts”.
Last April we misbehaved, then behaved for 3 months, misbehaved in August, behaved in September, then really misbehaved for 3 months, started listening again, and then bounced back and forth like a yo-yo the last 3 months because we couldn’t make up our minds.

digitalistmag,https://www.digitalistmag.com/improving-lives/2018/08/08/sustainable-business-is-profitable-business-06181889/ ,"Take. Make. Dispose.
For more than 150 years, businesses have subscribed to this linear economic model of production. Companies take raw materials, make their products, and dispose of their waste.
But today, businesses are opting for more sustainable approaches. They’re searching for ways to reuse waste and remanufacture goods. They’re exploring methods to extend service life and repair products. They’re embracing the circular economy.
On a recent episode of Game-Changing Conversations, guests revealed that the circular economy doesn’t only provide businesses with a more sustainable approach to production, it offers an opportunity to increase profitability.
An origin story: The conception of the circular economy
During the broadcast, panelist Christopher Koch, director of thought leadership for the SAP Center for Business Insight, explained how the circular economy came to be.
It was 1972. An oil refinery in Denmark discovered it had an excess of natural gas. A company’s executive brought this up to the leader of a nearby plasterboard manufacturer, and the pair quickly realized it would benefit both organizations to share the surplus.
The oil refinery would no longer have to pay to dispose of its excess waste, while the plasterboard manufacturer would eliminate the costly expense of importing gas from some far-off location.
The arrangement wasn’t made with an eye toward protecting the environment – even though it did. It simply made financial sense for both companies.
Today, the two businesses are saving nearly $100 million per year. And together, they’re greatly reducing waste and significantly lowering emissions.
Seize the moment: Create one if it doesn’t exist
Legendary actor and comedian Milton Berle once said, “If opportunity doesn’t knock, build a door.”
Christopher Koch believes executives who have yet to embrace the circular economy should take these words to heart. He thinks the traditional linear economy has run its course and far too many supply chain organizations are missing out on opportunities created by the circular economy – particularly, growth and profitability.
Citing a 2015 Nielsen global sustainability report, Koch said that consumer brands with a demonstrated commitment to sustainability grew 3% more in one year than their non-sustainable competitors.
Guest Will Ritzrau, SAP’s director of sustainability, mentioned that a 2016 Conference Board report stated that Philips Lighting’s energy-efficient LED bulbs account for as much as 50% of the company’s annual revenue.
Why are organizations that prioritize sustainability surpassing their peers and growing at record rates? Because consumers believe in the cause.
Buyers are eager to do business with companies that share their values. Research has even shown that customers are willing to pay more money for sustainable products.
Alter life as you know it: Rethink the traditional supply chain
Robin Williams, playing the role of high-school English teacher John Keating, uttered his fair share of inspiring lines in the film “Dead Poets Society.” One of his most memorable quotes came when he told his students:
“No matter what people tell you, words and ideas can change the world.”
According to Will Ritzrau, the circular economy is one such idea.
Most supply chain businesses work with finite raw materials. At some point, these resources will cease to exist. Ecotricity estimates that fossil fuels could be depleted as early as 2088.
So it’s crucial that companies begin taking steps to deal with this reality – and the sooner the better.
One solution is to create new business models based on circular economy concepts. If your organization can develop a more sustainable approach that emphasizes reusing materials, repairing goods, and remanufacturing products, you can start reducing your dependence on nonrenewable resources.
Will Ritzrau pointed to Airbnb as a great example of a company that was able to create a brand-new business model that’s both sustainable and economically viable.
Rather than constructing new buildings where out-of-town guests can stay, Airbnb connects homeowners who have extra space with travelers looking for accommodations. So the company – and its users – have found a way to reuse and monetize existing resources.
It’s an idea that’s changed the world – and made life better for businesses and consumers alike.
The final word
Christopher Koch and Will Ritzrau agree that the circular economy is a radical and unproven concept. But it’s one well worth pursuing for supply chain companies. The potential to create additional business value is just too hard to ignore.
So, how can your organization adopt a circular economy approach and start turning sustainability into profitability?
The show’s panelists say the first step is to develop greater trust with your business partners. And they recommend emerging technologies, like blockchain and the Internet of Things, to help build a stronger foundation of trust, enabling you to increase supply chain transparency and confidently collaborate with other companies.
Together, you can run your businesses more efficiently, more responsibly, and more profitably.

thethrivingsmallbusiness,https://thethrivingsmallbusiness.com/sustainable-business-practices/ ,"There seems to be more and more education on the importance of corporate social responsibility in support of sustainable business practices.
The increasingly popular green approach to business practices is what sustainability is all about.
Sustainability is a term that has grown in popularity and has become a catchphrase for green business practices that has been incorporated into many corporate strategies.
The definition of sustainability is:
“The quality of not being harmful to the environment or depleting natural resources, and thereby supporting long-term ecological balance.”
The EPA defines sustainability as:
“Everything that we need for our survival and well-being depends, either directly or indirectly, on our natural environment. Sustainability creates and maintains the conditions under which humans and nature can exist in productive harmony, that permit fulfilling the social, economic, and other requirements of present and future generations. Sustainability is important to make sure that we have and will continue to have, the water, materials, and resources to protect human health and our environment.”
There is more and more research that suggests that customers care about sustainability and want to partner with businesses that incorporate social responsibility into their business strategy.
As consumers become more educated, they look for businesses that share their values.
Regardless of the size of the organization, there are things we can all do to participate in conserving resources.
8 Sustainable Business Practice Examples
1. Be Intentional About Sustainability
Sustainability needs to be incorporated into corporate strategies and reflected in organizational business goals. This means making this a priority in every aspect of organizational operations.
As with any other business initiative, you need to make a plan of action and assign accountability. Hold people accountable and measure the results.
Once that is done, do it again. This will create momentum in your sustainability efforts.
2. Partner with Employees
Invest the time in training employees on the importance of sustaining the environment and share what the organization is doing to help conserve resources.
Solicit additional ideas from employees for resource conservation.
You might be surprised at what employees are experiencing and can offer ideas to reduce waste and improve their work environment.
Case Study: Walmart had a manager in one of its stores that noticed that employee vending machines had lights that ran all the time even though employees could see the products without additional lighting.
Walmart made some changes, turned off those lights in all employee lounge vending machines, and saved a staggering $1 million dollars a year in energy costs!
What similar ideas do your employees have?
3. Water And Electric Conservation
Conserving our water is something we can all participate in by reducing the opportunities for wasting this valuable resource.
For example, converting to energy-efficient faucets, toilets, and lighting can be a great way to save water, energy, and budget dollars.
4. Supply Chains
Statistics show that customers prefer working with sustainable companies that are environmentally friendly.
Maintain a list of sustainable friendly vendors and make it a priority to only use organizations that embrace sustainable business practices.
Negotiate contracts with this expectation made clear.
5. Develop a Recycling Program
Develop an in-house program for recyclable products like:
- fluorescent light-bulbs
- electronics
- computers and monitors
- paper products
- supplies
Use your waste management vendor to help create a process for this.
6. Chemical Management
We are learning more and more about the impact of chemicals on our environment.
Strive to use green cleaning products and non-chemical products for pest control and weed management.
Use your chemical vendors to help train employees on the proper use and disposal of chemicals.
If you outsource your facility cleaning to a professional cleaning company, insist on the use of green products.
7. Purchase Only Energy Efficient Products
Look for energy-efficient electronic products and use environmentally friendly settings on office equipment.
Choose computer, electronic, and IT acquisition products that are EPEAT registered to ensure the highest levels of efficiency.
8. Develop Sustainability Work Policies
Develop sustainability policies and procedures to reinforce the efforts.
Things like, power down equipment at the end of the day and enable energy savings settings on all computers and desktops, are examples of policies that can support the cause.
The challenge to sustain the environment can be overwhelming, but if each of our organizations, large or small, does its part, we can all contribute to conserving this great planet that we call home.

It’s no surprise that many large multinational corporations are paying increased attention to sustainability-oriented innovation (which we’re broadly defining as improvements for social good, not just “green” initiatives).1 Faced with mounting challenges and pressure from governments, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), investors, and employees to be more aware of the environmental and social impacts of business activities, companies are searching for ways to do things differently while also seeking opportunities for growth.2 As a result, many are attempting to tap into the creativity and entrepreneurial potential of their employees, encouraging them to develop new products, services, or business models that create value for both the company and society.3
Sustainability-oriented innovation isn’t new — researchers have been studying it for more than a decade.4 However, as traditional organizations adopt new technologies and business models, some are finding it difficult to get employees to think like entrepreneurs, which is essential to building an innovative culture that’s committed to solving environmental and social problems.5 To learn what leading companies are doing to address that challenge, we conducted interviews with managers at seven multinational companies recognized for their sustainability activities: AkzoNobel (a Dutch paint and chemicals company), Interface (a U.S. carpet-tile manufacturer), Johnson & Johnson (a U.S. medical products, pharmaceuticals, and consumer goods company), Pearson Education (a British education and publishing company), Koninklijke Philips (a Dutch company involved in health care, consumer electronics, and lighting),6 UBS (a Swiss financial services company), and Unilever (a Dutch-British consumer goods company). (See “About the Research.”) In this article, we integrate the experiences of these companies with findings from prior studies to illustrate what effective sustainability-oriented innovation looks like and to describe how companies can cultivate the entrepreneurial thinking and behavior that will spark such efforts.
What Sustainability-Oriented Innovation Culture Looks Like
Sustainability-oriented innovation takes many forms — everything from the development of new or improved products or services to the creation of new processes and business models that bring benefits to the environment or the society at large.7 While the innovations themselves may or may not be disruptive or radical, the idea is to mitigate the negative impacts of existing solutions or, even better, make a positive impact.

Corporations are making significant progress in addressing sustainability. Most large companies now have a statement of social purpose, many are signatories to the UN Global Compact and support the Sustainable Development Goals, many report progress against material quantitative metrics, and some have joined collaborative efforts to tackle existential environmental or societal issues. Davos 2020 further added to the momentum on stakeholder capitalism, disclosure of progress on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) metrics, and climate response.
These actions are encouraging. We have argued that corporations should Optimize for Both Social and Business Value, using their core businesses to deliver the financial returns expected by their owners and, in tandem, to help society meet its most significant challenges. To do so, we suggest that leaders reimagine corporate strategy by creating new modes of differentiation, embedding societal value into products and services, reimagining business models for sustainability, managing to new measures of performance, and reshaping business ecosystems to support these initiatives. While this is a tall order for any management team, the future of the company, our environment, and society depends on doing so.
In spite of this progress, few companies have tried to systematically understand the sustainability limits, vulnerabilities, and potential of their current business models and ecosystems. As a result, they risk diminishing their future competitiveness, license to operate, and shareholder returns. This oversight is not entirely surprising. Over the last few decades, managers have relaxed their ambitions regarding sustainable competitive advantage and have focused instead on shareholder returns. The result has been a greater reliance on financial strategies and M&A and a relentless optimization of processes and organization for efficiencies. While such priorities can create shareholder value in the near term, they can also hide weaknesses in the business model and work against the building of sustainable advantage. And when it comes to issues of sustainability and societal challenges, managers have often treated these separately from core business operations.
We have a long way to go before the two main uses of the S-word in business— sustainability and sustainable competitive advantage—fuse coherently in a way that can guide management thinking and corporate action in the decade ahead. This disconnect is both a wasted opportunity and an urgent social priority. For all the effort to date, we are making little or even negative aggregate progress in essential areas like carbon emissions, even as the societal effects and business impacts are increasingly apparent.
Current approaches have three critical limits: an overemphasis on compliance and reporting, a bifurcation of intent, and a primary focus on the company level.
There has been notable progress in defining metrics for materiality and sustainability and supporting them with increasingly relevant and better-quality data, but this has inadvertently created an overemphasis on reporting and compliance per se, rather than on strategy, action, and advantage. Instead of measuring action and progress against a strategic plan, ESG metrics have become an end in themselves.
This emphasis on sustainability as compliance gives rise to the second issue, the separation of strategy and sustainability considerations. Hence, progress on sustainability metrics is often (and ironically) not closely connected with progress in building sustainable advantage and performance. Quarterly calls and annual reporting emphasize financial returns. Material sustainability issues are considered separately, often in a separate organization with separate reporting and little connection to what drives value in the business.
Generic ESG metrics across industries are too coarse-grained to be closely aligned with any particular firm’s capabilities and strategy. Materiality metrics attempt to address this by identifying the critical issues by industry. However, industry boundaries are blurring (seven of the ten largest firms in the world are industry-spanning platform businesses), and companies sharing a common end product exhibit increasingly divergent strategies and business models. The emphasis is therefore on reporting at the level of the individual company, sometimes including parts of the supply chain but rarely including the full business ecosystem, the industry, or the broader network of stakeholders—all of which have a role in constraining or enabling advantage and sustainability. This a critical flaw, since many sustainability issues, like plastic waste or global warming, require collective action. They require the integration and amplification of other participants in an industry’s value chains and ecosystem for impact at scale, the adoption of agreed-upon norms and goals to prevent free-riding, and the trust and cooperation of nonbusiness stakeholders.
Exhibit 1 shows the spectrum of company maturity from corporate social responsibility (CSR) to “sustainable business model innovation” (SBM-I), the focus of this article. CSR often does little for either competitiveness or societal benefits at scale. More mature stages include driving compliance through incremental improvement of business processes, undertaking single-point innovations for sustainability in response to new compliance or stakeholder pressures, and ultimately, pursuing sustainable business model innovation. Few companies are positioned on the far right of the spectrum, a requirement for them to win through the ‘20s.
SBM-I addresses the limitations of current approaches. It builds on traditional business model innovation but applies it to a much expanded context. The basic idea is first to test the company’s current business model for sustainability against a broader temporal, societal, and spatial context so that its vulnerability to externalities, its sustainability limits, and its potential to create new environmental and societal value all become apparent. Second, it explores business model innovations by applying a combination of modular “transformations” to address limits and leverage potentials. Next, it connects business model innovations back to the core drivers of business advantage and financial performance in order to assess how they can deliver both value and sustainability. New models are piloted and tuned to capture advantage in the market and with investors and stakeholders, and to understand what changes are needed in the business ecosystem or at the industry level to create the right context for success.
In this way, strategy and sustainability are jointly considered and become mutually reinforcing, reporting gives way to action, and a company-centric approach gives way to a multilevel approach and new models of competition and sustainable value creation. (See Exhibit 2.) The idea builds on Michael Porter’s concept of shared value, but it unites sustainability and strategy efforts in a common methodology and process, both at the enterprise level and at higher levels.
We already see some leading companies taking ad hoc steps toward transforming their business models for improved performance, better environmental and societal sustainability, and sustainable advantage. But we believe there is far greater potential to be unlocked by applying a structured approach to SBM-I.
A sustainable business model that enables resilience, durability, and value creation through changing business, societal, and investor contexts has the following characteristics:
These nine properties articulate the goals of SBM-I and form the basis for stress-testing the quality of a business model. The following sections describe how to apply the methodology.
New business insights can come from changing perspectives on the company’s boundaries, resources, and time horizons. We suggest laying out the whole of the supply chain, the cradle to grave of the product life cycle, the adjacent business ecosystem, and all relevant stakeholders. Take a systems perspective to see the full ecosystem and market dynamics at work. Within this expanded business context, understand where issues of sustainability, risks, and stakeholder interests intersect with how the company makes money today. Look at how these issues and intersections are evolving over time. These insights should inform a company–specific and dynamic materiality matrix.
We recommend that the corporate strategy center take responsibility for creating and evolving this picture of the larger context of the business, its translation into the corporate dynamic materiality matrix, and a set of “strategic materiality scenarios” that provoke thinking about the future.
We recommend developing a range of stress tests that assess the business by considering emerging socioenvironmental trends and strategic materiality scenarios, and by simulating the scaling of the business in multiples of today’s activity levels across the value chain.
First, try exploring the implications of taking a current trend to its limits. One example could be investor activism on the company’s greenhouse gas emissions or tighter restrictions on plastic packaging. Enrich this exercise by interviewing key stakeholders propelling these trends, including customers, suppliers, analysts, activists, and investors. Understand how the trend could progress and mature and the potential impacts on stakeholders and the business. Is there a potential business advantage relative to competitors? Are there new or amplified risks? What would it take to mitigate those risks, change the dynamics, or exploit new constraints?
There are eight significant trends that we think will shape the societal context for businesses in the decade ahead:
Ask what each of these trends means for your company, its stakeholders, its industry, and its investors.
Second, go beyond single trends and build strategic materiality scenarios. The goal of this exercise is to help the business envision a very different operating context by colliding rich scenarios with the business model to assess its limits, risks, and opportunities for both financial gain and sustainability. The process starts by taking combinations of dynamics in the expanded business context and amplifying their materiality. In order to precipitate thought-provoking breakpoints, a good strategic materiality scenario has many of the following characteristics:
As an example of such a scenario, imagine that commodity exchanges start to segment trading based on sustainability properties. Imagine what would happen to a metal producer if the London Metals Exchange were to institute a new clean-metals trading market. Or to an agricultural company, should the Chicago Mercantile Exchange embrace new levels of traceability on regenerative agricultural commodities. Or consider the results of widely adopted standards changes. For example, what would happen to a clothing manufacturer if retailers adopted common labeling standards for “sustainable fashion,” including product traceability and measures of circularity? Similarly, develop materiality scenarios for key geographic markets. For example, what if the consumer goods operating model for the Indian market in 2025 was water-neutral and carbon-neutral, and companies had to use packaging with 90% recycled content, source all inputs domestically, and certify the national minimum wage throughout its supply chain?
Each strategic materiality scenario will generate a range of business model failures or challenges. Plot these on a matrix with impacts on sustainability intersecting with implications for business performance. The requirements for business model innovation will then become clear.
Third, explore scaling up. Simulate doubling and redoubling activity throughout the business model and value chain and observe stress points and fractures. Such an analysis uncovers hidden constraints and breakpoints in the current business model, possible competitive plays for the company, and the challenges of implementing alternative business models.
Companies generally recognize that scarcity can destroy a company’s scale advantages and choke the value chain with significant operational and financial consequences. But shortages can also be a lever for competitive advantage. Companies can use insights into how scarcity shifts over time owing to industry and ecosystem dynamics, market demands, and consumer sentiment to create better strategies and operating models. Surprisingly few companies simulate their business model at different scales under different constraints to understand where it will break down or where new opportunities will emerge—until either actually happens. A 2016 analysis by the Economist Intelligence Unit found that over the previous two years, 43% of companies surveyed had experienced a scarcity of natural resources that created an operational or financial challenge. It also found that 30% of companies claimed that access to land, water, and energy had a “very significant impact” on their operations and finances.
Aside from natural resources, other scarcities can arise and create new externalities. Take, for example, a global food and beverage company that seeks a quick transition away from virgin plastic in its packaging. It discovers that the entire flow of recyclable food-grade PET will meet only a small fraction of its demand, thus constraining its ability to respond to changing consumer sentiment and meet its sustainability aspirations. Or what if an industrial company that seeks to mitigate its environmental footprint through a circular-economy strategy discovers that its main competitor locked in recycled-waste contracts years earlier. Or imagine that a large cereal company wanting first-mover status in offering climate-smart nutrition to the premium segment discovers that too few acres are converting to regenerative agriculture because of a lack of farmer know-how and limited carbon sequestration incentives. Such analyses uncover constraints and breakpoints of the current business model, possible new competitive plays, and the challenges of alternative models.
Throughout the process of stress testing the business model, keep track of where it breaks down relative to the expectations of shareholders and the interests of stakeholders. This insight informs the next step of the methodology: applying sustainable business model innovations.
In this step, test how different combinations of SBM-I transformations can create competitive advantage, change the economics of the business and its ecosystem, and move the company toward resilience and sustainability. Design each of these transformations to create an environmental and societal surplus that translates into business value. Without collective value creation there can be no sustainable value extraction. Below are business model transformations to use as building blocks for SBM-I.
Own the origins. Compete by capturing and differentiating the societal content of inputs to production processes, products, or services. For example, capture those inputs produced with cleaner energy, sustainable sourcing practices, preserved biodiversity, recycled content, inclusive and empowering work practices, minimized waste, digitized traceability, or fair trade. This type of advantage requires advancing the societal performance of the supplier base and its stewardship of resources, communities, and trade flows. Consider PepsiCo’s Sustainable Farming Program, with its long history of ensuring that the company can sustainably source agricultural raw materials. It provides farmers with training and resources to implement best practices for farm productivity and sustainability. Such support creates an environmental and social surplus by enhancing soil health, improving biodiversity, optimizing nutrient and water usage, selecting the best seed varieties, avoiding deforestation, using integrated pest management, and implementing good health and safety practices.
Owning the origins may also require backward integration to ensure fast and complete upstream transformation and then holding and using these new capabilities for competitive advantage and differentiation downstream. For example, a beverage company recently backward integrated into recycling operations to gain a supply advantage in recycled PET plastics. In some cases, an origins advantage must be built from the ground up by seeding new technologies in the value chain to break open environmental and societal benefits.
Own the whole cycle. Compete by creating societal impact through influence on the whole product usage cycle from creation to end of life. This requires systems analysis to uncover business models that offer the richest competitive and financial options. For example, design the business model for circularity, recyclability, and waste to value. Or create new offerings that enable sharing rather than owning to ensure high utilization of resources and end-of-life value. Other possible moves include constructing enabling infrastructure to facilitate circularity and repurposing, integrating into other value chains to capture societal content, or empowering consumers to choose whole-cycle propositions based on value to people and the planet. Expect to reposition operations, reinvent supply chains and distribution, pursue new backward or forward integration, acquire business adjacencies, or undertake unconventional strategic partnering to achieve such ends.
Expand societal content. Compete by expanding the societal content of products or services on six dimensions of benefit: economic gains, environmental sustainability, lifetime well-being, ethical content, societal enablement, and access and inclusion. Then advocate for new standards, increase transparency and traceability, tune marketing and segmentation, engage customers on the product’s broader value and facilitate their involvement in more significant change, and capture value in pricing, share, and loyalty. In business-to-business offerings, help customers integrate the full societal benefits of the company’s products, services, and business model into their own aspirations, business model, and product/service offerings.
Danone’s “One Planet. One Health.” vision focuses the company on having positive impacts on the health and well-being of customers. The company promotes products that hit scientific nutrition targets, sets sales targets on nutritious products, educates some 35 million consumers on healthy diets and lifestyles, trains all its employees on nutrition and hydration, and ensures that everything is done with end-to-end sustainability in mind.
Energize the brand. Compete by digitally encoding, promoting, and monetizing the full accumulated societal value that is embedded in products and services along the entire value chain, from origin to customer and from cradle to grave. Use this data to rethink differentiation, brand experience, customer engagement, pricing for value, ESG reporting, investor engagement, and even new businesses. For example, strengthen the brand with promotions that showcase the business’s performance on open, clean, green, renewable, and inclusive attributes of its operations. Build engagement and loyalty by using data on products’ environmental and societal footprint to help customers understand how their choices affect the planet and its people.
Proctor & Gamble made news last year when it announced that it was reinventing brand management to “make sustainability irresistible” across its 20 leadership brands. P&G’s new approach includes defining a brand-specific ambition, innovating product and packaging to drive sustainable consumption, leveraging the brand to promote sustainable behaviors, reducing environmental impacts across the supply chain, and committing to ingredient transparency. By taking these actions, the company will reset the standard for building and promoting sustainable brands in the decade ahead.
Relocalize/Regionalize. Compete by contracting and reconnecting global value chains to bring societal benefits closer to home markets in ways that stakeholders will value. For example, build local and regional brands that better express local tastes and societal values while also reinforcing local economies. Or source from smaller local producers to minimize emissions while improving livelihoods. It may also be possible to reimagine production networks against total environmental and societal costs, or to capture local waste streams as new feedstocks into preprocessing. Or restructure today’s jobs for micro-
work that will employ a broader range of local talent and improve inclusion.
Small changes in the business can have big impacts in local markets and communities. For example, Hindustan Unilever cut its international sourcing of tomato paste from 100% to under 20% by partnering with Bayer and local companies to localize the inputs and de-risk the supply base. The program empowered 2,200 farmers, increased farmer earnings three- to fourfold, and cut crop cycles by one-third.
Expand the chains. Compete by layering onto the value chains of another industry to extend the reach, richness, and societal benefits of products and services for both parties, while at the same time changing the economics and risks of doing so. For example, use the reach of a consumer products distribution system to carry payments and financial services to small merchants; layer one company’s health services onto another company’s physical supply chain to benefit its workers and their families while expanding markets for health services; or use byproducts from one company’s operations as feedstocks into other companies’ value chains.
A notable example was an initiative launched by the UN Secretary-General’s Special Advocate for Inclusive Finance for Development. It brought together the CEOs of ten global corporations from five industries to identify cross-sector private-private partnerships to accelerate financial inclusion. Companies in consumer products, telecom services, insurance, banking, and payments looked for where their value chains could layer and integrate to expand the benefits of financial inclusion for small merchants, farmers, and women.
Build across sectors. Compete by creating new models that include the public and social sectors, particularly in rapidly developing economies, to improve the company’s business, ecosystem, and societal proposition. For example, work alongside government bilateral aid institutions and NGO development organizations to strengthen the agricultural capacity of smallholder farmers as reliable suppliers to the agroprocessing value chain. Or partner with global environmental organizations and governments to promote the reuse of ocean plastics as feedstocks to production systems. One company worked alongside a national government to strengthen and corruption-proof its social safety nets through digitization and electronic payments. In other cases, collective action across sectors is needed, for instance, to restructure recycling systems to enable greater penetration of waste-to-value business models. Extend this into industry coalitions for collective action that reshape broader rights to operate and generate new opportunities.
Royal DSM’s Africa Improved Foods (AIF) is a notable example. The company partnered with the public sector, international aid agencies, and local NGOs to tackle nutrition challenges in Rwanda while developing the market for fortified foods. A 45,000-ton-capacity facility employing 300 skilled factory workers was built with cofunding by DSM and international donors. In addition to providing employment, the facility is supplied by over 24,000 farmers, and AIF profits above necessary commercial returns go back to the government of Rwanda. The incremental value of the project over 15 years is estimated at $760 million; more important, fortified grains and locally branded products will increase the nutritional security of the population. We expect Royal DSM’s strategic positioning in a growing Africa to pay off through novel business models that seed the business and help countries meet their SDG goals.
Applying combinations of the foregoing SBM-I transformations to today’s business models will stretch strategic thinking and expose opportunities for new competitive advantages. It will show how the economics of the business and its ecosystem change, and how far the company moves toward sustainability. It will also stimulate ideas for new businesses and forward-looking investment. For example, when one company considered its sustainable business model transformation, it identified 60 related business opportunities. These ideas can load the corporate development and venturing process, offering companies new vectors for portfolio growth and asset development.
One crucial underlying concept here is that sustainable business models create and leverage an environmental and societal surplus, by which we mean the accumulation of sustainability assets that can carry secondary value for increasing returns.
Consider an example from the food value chain. An agricultural bank offers preferred financing to farmers for adopting regenerative agriculture and incorporates the net greenhouse gas sequestration into payment terms and offsets, thereby promoting farm sustainability and enabling the bank to accumulate new assets in available carbon offsets. Further along, a cereal producer locks in regenerative-farming suppliers within a preferred radius to create a supplier advantage for sustainable product content, reduced scope 3 emissions, and options in offsets. Finally, to the end market, a consumer company captures and nurtures customers willing to pay a premium for more sustainable products and see-through supply chains, also offering the company behavioral insights as a new asset for the business.
In our experience, environmental and societal surpluses are not limited to consumer chains but are possible across industry sectors, even in primary industries. A case in point is a metals company that further processes the byproducts of its refining operations into roadway aggregates to reduce waste and quarrying demand and improve roadway longevity. Such hidden environmental and societal surpluses offer new possibilities for creating business value while being good for the environment and society.
SBM-I is iterative, so assess the strength of each new business model transformation by detailing all the ways that it links into the important value drivers of the business, the performance of its value chains, and the strength of its business ecosystem. Then evaluate how well it deals with the risks, brittleness, and fracture points of today’s business model, how effectively it scales with increasing returns, and how it expands the options for the future under a range of likely industry and societal scenarios. As the exercise uncovers new limits, go back to the drawing board to further improve the business model by applying additional SBM-I transformations and testing new combinations. The process continues until the business model delivers the most potent mix of business, environmental, and social benefits.
We encourage companies to quickly pilot SBM-Is to refine the necessary process and product changes, sources of advantage, and ways to capture value through marketing, sales, and pricing.
Such SBM-I changes will demand new metrics to gain insights on performance. Throughout the process, we therefore identify the critical parameters that will allow for continuous assessment and improvement and help the company communicate value to its stakeholders and investors. In a sampling of 15 leading public companies’ annual and sustainability reports, we found that only 3 had described how their goals in sustainability could positively impact the financial performance of the business. That stands in contrast to an industrial building products company that rethought its business model to deliver carbon-neutral products. In addition to all the classic operating measures, the company set reporting metrics for each product’s exact contribution to mitigating global warming and communicated why that mattered to the company’s competitiveness and customer value proposition. Today, every product the company creates is 100% carbon neutral and it links that explicitly to differentiation and growth.
Many industries today face significant and sometimes existential environmental and societal issues. Solutions are beyond the reach of any one company and therefore place limits on how far it can fully realize the benefits of its SBM-I. Industry or cross-industry strategy and collective action are required, whether in terms of the general goal of cutting greenhouse gas emissions or, specifically, of decarbonizing the metals value chain, eliminating food loss and waste in the food value chain, eliminating single-use plastics in consumer products, or enabling a deep enough recycling system to meet circular-economy objectives. Such system-level constraints will become very clear through the SBM-I process.
Consequently, expect the SBM-I effort to define opportunities for “corporate statesmanship” that identify the shared interests of industry players as a basis for collective action. Further, some solutions will only be possible with industry and government collaboration. Take, for example, the real hurdles facing companies in acting to mitigate climate change. These include uncertainty on future regulation given the poor track record of governments in setting consistent and effective policies. Companies also face high and risky upfront investments to fund innovation. And then there are disadvantages for any company in moving first, which leads to wait-and-see behaviors across the industry even as the risks and costs of inaction rise.
Collaboration can increase the effectiveness and predictability of policy by leveraging objective, fact-based proposals, articulating common interests, de-risking and sharing high-fixed-cost investments and cross-industry learning, and accelerating impacts by unifying efforts at scale. An example is BDI (the Federation of German Industries) helping German industry assess the most economical lower-carbon pathways. Similarly, the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative created a $1 billion fund for innovation in carbon capture and sequestration. And going beyond the bounds of a single sector, the European public-private partnership SPRE brings together process industry sectors to fund cross-industry innovations in cement, ceramics, nonferrous metals, minerals, steel, and water.
Such collective action can enable new industry structures and context, mitigating individual company risk while expanding the space for the industry, related new industries, and investors. When correctly defined, rather than limiting competitive moves within the industry, collective action becomes empowering by eliminating the constraints that prevent companies from joining up sustainability and sustainable competitive advantage.
The overall societal context for business has changed. Companies now need to co-optimize for business and social value in order to deliver competitive total shareholder returns in the medium and long terms. The model of companies as economic islands that independently maximize financial value extraction is becoming obsolete. Many companies will respond to the ever-louder calls by investors and stakeholders for more disclosure and higher-quality, reliable ESG data and reporting. But that alone is insufficient to bring the worlds of strategy and sustainability together and secure resilience and durable competitive advantage while also increasing environmental and societal benefits. The continuous practice of sustainable business model innovation is the engine to do so. Leaders pursuing this quest will leave a legacy not only of a better company and better shareholder returns but also of a better society and planet.

As customers and investors join the chorus of concern about the need to protect resources over the long term, it’s become a hot topic in chemical industry boardrooms. Sustainability also involves many more issues than it did in the past, from water and food supplies to climate change. But there’s a major upside to all this attention. For many companies, the demand for sustainable products offers opportunities for revenue and margins that outweigh the associated costs.
Most chemical companies are aware of the potential and already have a sustainability strategy. But they’ve struggled to develop effective business cases for investment. Their proposals tend to be small compared with most other investments, and these often fail to pass muster because the benefits are too “soft.” Some companies, however, have made sustainability investments that more than paid for themselves through higher margins. The key to success is supporting the company’s new products and services with a clear strategic ambition, a focus on the main value to be generated, and a commitment to driving change throughout the organization.
Diverse Stakeholder Interest
Before 2000, the chemical industry faced little demand for sustainability beyond the need to protect worker health and safety and prevent environmental pollution. Since then, ambitions have broadened. The United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals, released in 2015, include ensuring that populations have sufficient food, water, and other key resources over the long term. Backing up these goals, several national governments have set strong sustainability targets with stepped-up enforcement.
Consumers and the general public, with help from NGOs, have made their voices heard as well. Whether you operate paraxylene plants in China or methanol plants in the US, your neighbors are aware of your operations and are increasingly willing to engage in protests and boycotts. Retailers, as agents of consumers, have also stepped in, with Walmart and other giants banning certain chemicals, such as triclosan, from their shelves.
Finally, institutional investors are increasingly making sustainability an investment criterion. A 2014 report from the Forum for Sustainable and Responsible Investment found that sustainability-minded investment now represents almost a fifth of assets under management. Attention has mainly centered on energy stocks but is beginning to spread to chemicals.
These trends have a silver lining: they create demand for new products and services that address sustainability challenges. For at least a significant segment of the chemical industry, sustainability has the potential to move from a compliance issue to a revenue generator. (See Exhibit 1.)
Laying Out a Sustainability Strategy
Chemical companies are increasingly aware of this demand. In 2015, as part of an annual BCG survey conducted with MIT Sloan Management Review on sustainability issues in a variety of industries, 85% of chemical companies reported having a sustainability strategy. That was more than any other industry covered, and a 70% increase from 2009. Also in 2015, 95% of chemical company executives reported that investors were paying closer attention to sustainability performance—yet only 36% said their company had developed a clear business case or a proven value proposition for sustainability. That’s up from 19% in 2009, but it shows that many companies are still struggling to make the case for investing in sustainability initiatives. (See “Investors Care More About Sustainability Than Many Executives Believe,” BCG article, May 2016.)
To gain a richer understanding of chemical companies’ experience with sustainability strategies, we studied 15 chemical and petrochemical businesses in developed and emerging economies. The sample included diversified companies as well as focused firms. Through interviews and other research, combined with insights from BCG’s project work, we have developed a framework that can help chemical companies get more value from their sustainability initiatives and investments. The framework comprises three steps: setting the strategic ambition, articulating the business case, and driving results.
Setting the Strategic Ambition
Ambition runs along a continuum, and while we urge companies to raise their sights as they gain more expertise (and thus see more possibilities), not all companies have the same options. For example, those focused on basic chemicals, with few possibilities for differentiation, will tend to have fewer opportunities. Specialty chemical companies, by contrast, have more options because they are closer to end consumers who reward sustainability-driven innovation. Companies with a high public profile place greater weight on benefits to their reputation, so they will have an easier time making the case for sustainability than less well-known companies, which will focus on direct financial impacts. A single company can set different ambitions for its individual businesses.
Across the chemicals sector, we see five distinct levels of strategic ambition for sustainability. (See Exhibit 2.) Here are the assumptions and guidelines for each one, from basic to most ambitious:
- License to Operate. Companies that follow this approach—as most have, until recently—see no reason to do more than the minimum to satisfy regulators and perhaps preempt future rules. Legal requirements determine disclosures, not the company’s public image.
- Isolated Initiatives. Companies with this level of ambition see some payoff in sustainability that goes beyond mere compliance and are comfortable trying out a few small initiatives. They add some sustainability-oriented performance indicators to address areas of greatest concern and make sure to publicize their efforts in order to boost the company’s image.
- Full Embrace. Here companies are fully onboard, and sustainability is a key—but not the dominating—part of corporate strategy. Companies pursue major investments across multiple areas of sustainability, both to develop new products and services and to improve internal operations. They adopt clear goals and a broad set of metrics. But sustainability efforts still have to compete with other goals.
- Sustainability Innovator. For companies at this level of strategic ambition, the opportunity is so great that sustainability is the driving force behind new products and services. Often these efforts center on a flagship offering that represents a major advance over current practice. Most of the business portfolio is still oriented toward conventional activities, but all of these must meet rigorous standards, from sourcing to reuse or disposal, as applicable. Companies innovate toward sustainability while gradually divesting the less sustainable parts of the business, and they communicate transparently with the public.
- Sustainability at the Center. This is a niche strategy for startup and established companies with new technologies, such as performance-oriented biopolymers made from renewables. The resulting products or services are core to the company, whose entire business model is to serve the demand for sustainability. These companies don’t have to be fully independent; some are joint ventures with established chemical firms. But all require stringent management, a sustainability mindset throughout the organization, and strong marketing.
Over time, we expect most companies to move along this continuum as they respond to increasing regulation and uncover new, profitable opportunities.
Articulating the Business Case
The next step is to clarify where—within the scope of the company’s ambition—the principal value will be created and to develop a business case that justifies the needed investment. Exactly how this plays out will vary from company to company, but our research suggests four approaches around which the business case can be built, listed here in order of least to most ambitious:
- Adopting Eco-efficient Processes. The products and services are the same, but production methods change to address sustainability concerns. New machinery, for example, might reduce water consumption or allow for recycling. In some cases, the changes don’t even need to involve the physical side of production; it may be enough to invest in better monitoring and assessment. Lanxess, for example, has found that some customers are willing to pay a premium simply because they value the company’s transparency about its existing sustainable production standards.
- Embracing Eco-efficient Raw Materials. Here the emphasis is on redesigning existing products to use new, more sustainable inputs—ones that generate less waste in production, for instance, or yield products that are easier to recycle at the end of their useful lives. Since such materials usually cost more, companies need to identify the payoff, either in lower production costs or a higher price premium. The petroleum giant Total, for example, recently launched a joint venture with Corbion to build a PLA polymerization plant with an annual capacity of 75,000 tons. The plant will generate biodegradable plastics that will reduce end users’ solid waste—and support a higher price point than conventional plastics. Likewise, Borealis took note of the rising demand for blended plastics when it acquired MTM Plastics, which mixes recycled and virgin materials to generate commercial-grade plastics.
- Fielding New Offerings. Companies taking this approach focus on developing new products and services in response to the growing demand for sustainability. These can be true innovations or simply new services enabled by the company’s existing approach to sustainability. With water supplies threatened in many parts of the world, for example, Dow Chemical has built a $1 billion water and process solutions business. Newlight, a startup, developed AirCarbon thermoplastics from captured carbon emissions. On the service side, BASF created a consulting business out of its internal eco-efficiency methodology.
- Improving Downstream Performance. Here the company’s own sustainability footprint is unchanged, but products are altered to provide such benefits as reduced waste or lower carbon emissions. For example, a product can be redesigned to increase its reusability or recyclability, thus diminishing the environmental footprint of its users. Demonstrating such benefits usually requires a comprehensive product life cycle assessment covering the activities of the chemical company, its customers, and end users. High-growth areas, such as plastics for automobiles, offer the greatest potential for a price premium here. Solvay, for example, has been developing lightweight plastics that reduce products’ energy usage and emissions for end users.
To build the business case for any of these four approaches, the company first needs to understand the impact of the new or altered product over its life cycle. It then designs the product to improve its life cycle value and reduce its environmental footprint. After validating the design, the company quantifies the benefits across the value chain and defines the new cost structure. Then it can factor the product’s benefits into pricing and marketing to ensure sufficient payoff. Are there likely to be enough buyers, willing to pay a high enough price, to generate a return on the investment? How will the company communicate with or educate consumers about the benefits?
Driving Results
To realize the value from sustainability investments, companies often need to adjust their ways of working. The greater their strategic ambition, the more they need to drive change throughout the organization. Leading companies have adopted a number of supportive measures. (See Exhibit 3.)
- Organizational Structure. A chief sustainability officer, reporting to the CEO and engaging with external stakeholders, typically leads the effort and is supported by dedicated staff at headquarters and throughout the organization. Dow Chemical went even further, combining an executive sustainability team with an external advisory council comprising sustainability experts, scientists, and community organizations. Both the team and the council communicated with people with subject matter expertise throughout the business units.
- Clear Performance Indicators. These are typically based on ambitious and clearly communicated targets across the value chain. Companies monitor them regularly, communicate the results, and include them with other KPIs when determining executive and middle-manager promotions and bonuses.
- Consistent Decision Criteria. The organization as a whole gives weight to sustainability concerns in capital investments, mergers, and acquisitions. One company, for example, canceled a planned polyethylene plant because it would have required toxic additives. Another company was close to acquiring a plant but declined the deal after assessing its carbon footprint over the long term.
- Stakeholder Communication. The most mature companies tell stories, backed up by data, that appeal to stakeholders’ emotions. They also provide regular updates on their sustainability activities. They’re present in social media as well as conventional channels, they participate in public rankings, and they segment and tailor their communications to the interests of their audience. They take the time to listen and adapt their practices accordingly. To help forge consensus and shape industry standards, they collaborate with a variety of industry associations, nonprofits, and even NGOs.
- Product Assessment. Leading companies incorporate sustainability analysis into decisions about their product portfolios. They rank each offering according to the sustainability of the manufacturing process and how the product will be used over its life cycle. Products at the bottom of the ranking are often divested or phased out, while highly ranked products receive R&D funding.
- Substrategies. Global companies increasingly understand that certain aspects of sustainability are of greater concern in some regions than in others. Much of Asia, for example, struggles with water scarcity, while in Africa people are also concerned about food security. Thus, to adapt its global strategy to regional demand, a company might tailor its production footprint so that water-intensive plants do not need to be located in semiarid regions.
The Way Forward
As the demand for sustainability rises and executives gain greater experience with how it contributes to competitive advantage, investments in sustainable products and processes will become more central to companies’ overall business strategy. This shift will make it easier to develop and justify business cases for new investment. Over time, these initiatives could lead to major new sources of earnings, while boosting the industry’s overall standing in the marketplace.
In following the three-step framework set out here, companies should start with only one or two initiatives and see how these play out in the organization. Sustainability will mean different things for different companies—and even for different divisions. Over time, in response to the opportunities that arise and its own ambition, the organization can expand its capabilities and move strategically along the sustainability spectrum. . Businesses are at a defining moment to act on sustainability. Those that act decisively have the opportunity to create resilience and sustainable competitive advantage for their business models for the long term.
The role of business in society has evolved. Investors, customers, employees, policy makers, and society as a whole demand proof that a company is doing more than just conducting business in a sustainable way and abiding by ethical business practices—and stakeholders expect companies to both have a purpose and contribute to the greater good. Surface-level sustainability and corporate social responsibility efforts that do not transform the business model miss the opportunity to capture the true value of what we call total societal impact (TSI).
TSI is the leverage and transformation of a company’s core business models, capabilities, and operations to create positive economic, social, and environmental impact in ways that are profitable. This growth has wide benefits for the company itself, for its stakeholders, and for society.
Those that lean in and embrace TSI and sustainability in the short term will have the benefit of advancing while others struggle to hold their ground. Companies that lean out—declining to integrate sustainability into how they survive and thrive—should carefully weigh the cost of that tradeoff in the long term.
Fully embracing and embedding a TSI lens allows companies to create meaningful, at-scale impact while unlocking new opportunities for growth and advantage. In exploring TSI opportunities, companies can expand the value of products or services on six dimensions of impact: economic vitality, environmental sustainability, lifetime well-being, ethical capacity, societal enablement, and access and inclusion.
These efforts can create new sources of differentiation, operating advantage, network dynamics, and societal value—and overall more sustainable, durable, and resilient businesses that benefit shareholders and society. They also better enable companies to live their purpose, inspire, and rally stakeholders to drive collective action toward a better future for all—transforming and expanding the role of business in society.

hbr,https://hbr.org/2017/12/the-top-10-sustainable-business-stories-of-2017 https://hbr.org/2011/10/the-sustainable-economy ,"The year 2017 has been a long, strange trip. The definition of sustainability in business evolved quickly — the topic in executive suites now covers a wide range of issues that address how a company navigates environmental and social challenges. From carbon footprint to taking a stand on human rights or immigration, companies need a position and strategy on all of this and more.
We saw big leaps both backward and forward this year, some of which weren’t especially surprising. In my year-end wrap up for 2016, for instance, I predicted that “the context for sustainable business in 2017 may center on the competition between two stories, the election of Donald Trump and significant action on climate change.” That’s pretty much what happened. Trump pulled the U.S. out of the Paris climate accord, the hard-won global agreement to tackle the greatest threat to humanity and the economy, becoming the only country in the world on the sidelines.
But the Newtonian equal-and-opposite reaction from business, states, and cities was nothing short of amazing. Their pushback on policy decisions is my #1 story of 2017. Here’s more on that, plus nine additional developments business leaders need to pay attention to.
Climate, Clean Tech, and the Environment
1. U.S. leaders from the public and private sectors rejected Trump’s decision on the Paris accord and committed to climate action.
On the day of the president’s announcement about the Paris climate accord, 25 multinationals — including Apple, Facebook, Google, HPE, Ingersoll Rand, Intel, Microsoft, PG&E, Tiffany, and Unilever — ran a full page ad in the Wall Street Journal asking Trump to stay committed to the agreement. By that weekend, dozens of big companies declared, We Are Still In. This public statement includes thousands of signatories — not just companies, but states, cities, and universities.
On the governmental side, the states of California, Washington, New York, and others representing a third of the U.S. population and GDP announced the formation of the U.S. Climate Alliance. California Governor Jerry Brown emerged as the de facto climate leader for the United States, holding his own meetings in China and headlining a delegation to the global climate talks in Bonn. A growing list of 385 local leaders have joined the U.S. Climate Mayors pact as well. A group of high -profile business leaders offered their thoughts on the sustainability agenda right here at HBR (I am also an adviser to that effort). In total, the message to the rest of the world has been clear: “sub-national” support for climate action is very strong in the United States.
2. The deadly costs of climate change became even more obvious.
This year, the science got clearer about the connection between extreme weather and human-caused climate change. And that extreme weather was horrifying. Record-setting storms, floods, and drought-driven fires wreaked havoc around the world. Flooding in South Asia killed more than 1,200 people. Asia also experienced shocking heat, including a day in Pakistan that hit nearly 130 degrees Fahrenheit. Hurricane Harvey hit Houston hard (the before-and-after flooding pictures are mind-boggling), and the national weather service added colors to flood maps to reflect the record 30 inches of rain that fell. Hurricane Irma demolished Caribbean islands, and Hurricane Maria created an economic and humanitarian disaster in Puerto Rico. As of this writing, months after the storm, a third of the island is still without power, and 10% of these U.S. citizens have no water. On the U.S. mainland, unprecedented wildfires ripped through Napa and central California, as well as Los Angeles County.
These extreme weather events are primarily human tragedies, but they’re economic and business disasters as well. When entire regions are under water or lose power for months, it’s not good for local and national economies. In fact, the economic cost of extreme weather is vast and rising. In the 1980s, 27 weather events cost the U.S. more than $1 billion each (in today’s dollars). A little more than halfway through the current decade, we’ve already experienced 89 billion-dollar events, and they’re much, much larger. Hurricane Sandy in 2012 and the big trio of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria this year are all $50 billion to $100 billion storms.
3. The Trump administration started dismantling environmental protections.
In the U.S., the new administration’s policy goes beyond pulling out of Paris. We’re seeing an all-out assault on our air, water, climate, and land. The EPA head, Scott Pruitt, spent years suing the agency and essentially intends on dismantling it. Pruitt and Trump, with assists from Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke and Energy Secretary Rick Perry, are working to, for example:
- Eliminate the Clean Power Plan (one of President Obama’s main efforts to rein in power plant carbon pollution).
- Reduce restrictions on some dangerous chemicals and pesticides.
- Get rid of rules that limit natural gas leaks.
- Slash the size of national monuments in what The New York Times called “the largest rollback of federal land protection in the nation’s history.” (One company, Patagonia, took an aggressive public stand against these moves.)
- Prop up coal and nuclear power against all economics and market forces.
Bi-partisan groups of former energy commissioners and EPA heads have spoken out against every move. And while many companies may hope to save money in the short run with fewer regulatory hurdles, it’s also clear that an unhealthier environment is not great for businesses, its customers, its communities, or its employees in the long term.
4. Investors woke up about climate risk and benefits of sustainability.
I know, I know, Wall Street only cares about short-term earnings performance. And yet there’s something brewing among big institutional players, the economy’s risk assessors, and even some Wall Street types. For example, Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock (with $6 trillion in assets under its management) asked business leaders to focus on “long-term value creation” in his third annual letter to S&P 500 CEOs. BlackRock also said its “engagement priorities” for talking to CEOs would include climate risk and boardroom diversity.
Shareholder resolutions on climate disclosure and strategies succeeded for the first time at Occidental Petroleum and ExxonMobil as well. Fund giant Vanguard, which led the charge at Exxon, also declared climate risk and gender diversity “defining themes” of its investment strategy. Institutional investors continued to drive climate action also, with hundreds signing a statement of support for the Paris agreement. And Norway’s $1 trillion Wealth Fund is forcing banks to disclose the carbon footprint of loans and will divest from fossil fuels. In late-breaking news, the World Bank will stop financing upstream oil and gas projects after 2019.
Finally, a few big developing stories could create long-term ripples. First, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (or TCFD) — chaired and led by financial giant and former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg — issued a critical set of guidelines for investors and insurers to understand climate risks. On the heels of TCFD, a group of 225 global investors with $26 trillion under management launched “Climate Action 100+” to “engage” with large emitters on their management and disclosure of climate risks. And in fascinatings new on the debt financing front, Moody’s told cities to address climate risks or face downgrades on their bonds. Could shifting rates on company debt be far behind?
5. China accelerated its clean tech advantage.
On the fifth day of 2017, China announced it would spend $360 billion on renewable energy by 2020. The rest of the year brought even more leadership: China cancelled 103 coal plants, committed to cut coal by 30%, made big moves in electric vehicles (see #9, below), erected the world’s largest land-based and floating solar farms (becoming the world’s largest solar producer in the process), and – in one of the most fun stories of the year — built a solar farm in the shape of a giant panda just for the heck of it. Essentially, in 2017, China took over the role of global climate leader and then, to top it off, committed nearly a trillion dollars in infrastructure spending to connect China to the rest of the world.
6. Clean tech continued its relentless march (and coal continued to die).
As a whole, the economics of every major green technology got radically better. (Morgan Stanley predicted an “inflection point” in 2020, when renewables become the cheapest energy source globally.) But to focus on two intertwined areas, look at what happened with electric vehicles (EVs) and battery storage.
On the former, some large economies, including France, India, Britain, Norway, and China, committed to ban diesel and gas vehicles. Automakers moved quickly as well, with GM and Ford announcing major investments in EVs and Volvo phasing out conventional engines starting as soon as 2019. A group of multinationals with big logistics operations launched EV100, an initiative to speed up the switch to EVs. One big city, Shenzhen, China, moved its entire bus fleet to EV. In total, EV sales were up 63% globally.
The economics of batteries (needed for EVs and, critically, the grid so we can store clean energy) continued to get much better—50% cheaper since 2014. Tesla built grid-scale storage for Southern California and quickly erected the world’s largest lithium ion battery storage in Australia. The end result is going to be the end of coal, bolstered by commitments from states like Michigan to go coal-free—and the entire EU, which will build no new coal plants after 2020.
The Role of Business in Society
7. Famous CEOs took moral stands.
One group of business leaders faced a tough decision this year: stay in the president’s CEO advisory councils or protest his policies by pulling out. A few, like Tesla’s Elon Musk and Disney’s Robert Iger, left in the spring after the Paris climate decision. But most stayed on — that is, until the Charlottesville, Virginia white nationalist marches. When the president said there were “some very fine people” among the white supremacists, the CEO Advisory Councils disbanded quickly, with the leaders of Pepsi, IBM, GM, BCG, Merck, 3M, and others walking away (a few wanted to stay, but the momentum was clear).
One CEO in particular, Apple’s Tim Cook (who was not formally on the councils) denounced the “moral equivalence” of white supremacists and human rights protesters, but he also went on to say something more important about business: “We have a moral responsibility to help grow the economy, to help grow jobs, to contribute to this country and to other countries that we do business in.” In essence, Cook made a blended argument for sustainability that isn’t about philanthropy and the polar bears, but about the core business and its role in society. And yet, Apple had its own challenges. Proving that no company’s actions are black and white, the world discovered that Apple has stashed a quarter of a trillion dollars in cash outside the U.S. to avoid taxes. Yes, it’s legal, but is it right? Given Cook’s own argument, it’s an uncomfortable disconnect.
8. Companies went to court.
This year large companies dove into legal battles on social hot-button issues to an unusual degree. Tech companies big and small filed an “amicus brief” to fight the president’s first executive order on immigration (biotech firms spoke out as well). Fifty big companies asked a New York federal appeals court to fight discrimination based on sexual orientation. Companies also lobbied for pro-environmental and social policies. Companies went local as well, with seven big guns — Procter & Gamble, Walmart, Unilever, General Mills, Target, General Motors, and Nestle — pushing the state of Missouri to pass a bill to make it easier for them to buy renewable energy.
9. The super bowl of sustainability advertising was… the actual Super Bowl.
A surprising number of big brands used the most expensive, most viewed advertising time in the world to do something different this year: Instead of pitching products the old-fashioned way, focusing on how great it tastes or will make you feel, they chose to say something about an important aspect of social sustainability. And they took risky stands, in often not-so-veiled ways, against the policies of the new U.S. president.
Budweiser’s ad told the story of their founder and proudly pointed out his immigrant status. Little-known 84 Lumber went viral with a five-minute video about the journey of a family from central America. Coca-Cola focused on diversity and inclusion with its multi-lingual ad. And Audi’s ad “Daughter” lamented the lack of pay equity for women (though Audi then took heat for its own record on pay and women in leadership, showing that sustainability-focused ads can be risky).
10. Unilever fights off a hostile takeover bid.
Unilever is the consensus corporate leader on managing sustainability for business and societal value. That’s why I consider the attempted takeover of Unilever by Kraft Heinz and 3G Capital an important sustainability story.
It is unlikely that a firm like 3G would continue supporting the sustainability strategy at the heart of Unilever, even though the strategy has been wildly successful (the company’s market cap was at an all-time high — and then went up another 20% after the takeover attempt). As Unilever’s CEO, Paul Polman told the Financial Times, it was “clearly a clash between a long-term, sustainable business model for multiple stakeholders and a model that is entirely focused on shareholder primacy.” Everyone interested in seeing companies lead the charge to a thriving world breathed a sigh of relief. (Full disclosure: I’ve been an advisor to Unilever North America, but I had zero involvement on this issue.)
So what’s next?
It’s risky to say anything definitive about the future. But I do believe that some mega-trends have too much inertia for any one stakeholder to completely disrupt. So some light predictions for 2018:
- The climate will continue to get more volatile. Any remaining business leaders who don’t understand climate as a systemic risk and opportunity will have to get on board.
- Millennials and Gen Z will continue to push for purpose and meaning in work and life.
- AI, big data, blockchain, and other tech will change how we understand companies, products, and services, leading even more to embrace “clean labels” (like Walmart, Target, and Panera did this year).
- To meet ever-rising expectations, and drive business value, companies will set more and more aggressive sustainability goals.
- Clean tech will be under attack by the U.S. administration, but it will continue to prevail globally.
- Finally, the #metoo movement against sexual harassment, which is sweeping through politics and media, will hit big business. We may see some senior Fortune 500 execs fall.
Onward to 2018. Have a happy, healthy, and sustainable New Year! . Download this podcast
No one these days seriously denies the need for sustainable business practices. Even those concerned about only business and not the fate of the planet recognize that the viability of business itself depends on the resources of healthy ecosystems—fresh water, clean air, robust biodiversity, productive land—and on the stability of just societies. Happily, most of us also care about these things directly.
And yet collectively we have not been making progress on reducing the damage business does to the world. Admirable companies have launched inspiring initiatives, but the negative impacts of business activity continue to grow.
The problem is simple. It’s generally cheaper to buy the product that has a worse impact on its environment than the equivalent product that does less harm. Higher cost to planet does not translate to higher price to customer. Of course, this is due to the fact that businesses are rarely obliged to pay for the full toll their operations take on the world. Because many of these impacts have been hard to gauge with any precision—or to assign to individual businesses with fairness—their costs have remained external to businesses’ accounting.
But what if those externalized costs could be quantified and assigned? What if we could get to the point where the lowest-priced T-shirt was also the one doing the least harm to the planet and society? In that scenario, consumers’ bargain hunting would align perfectly with business practices that sustain a healthy and just world, and powerful market forces would be put in the service of sustainability’s goals. This is not a flash of brilliance on our part—it’s what sustainability theorists have said all along. “True cost accounting” has long been the holy grail of the movement.
Our companies, Patagonia and Blu Skye, have devoted decades to the business of sustainability, and never before have we felt the optimism we feel now. Developments on three fronts, long in the works and now converging, make it not only possible but inevitable that successful business will become synonymous with sustainable business. First, “prices” are now being calculated for many things that had been considered priceless; second, capital is flowing into companies known to manage those costs well; and third, indices are being established that allow disparate contributors in a supply chain to converge on sustainability standards. Each of these developments has yielded meaningful gains on its own, but because all three have now reached a certain maturity, we are entering a new, accelerated phase of progress. The dots are connecting, and a whole different picture of how to prosper in business is emerging.
The concept of sustainability has evolved across three eras. In the beginning, it was seen as an operational concern, consisting of largely defensive efforts to reduce companies’ environmental footprints and cut waste. That evolved into a more strategic stance—let’s call it Sustainability 2.0. The focus shifted from cost reduction to innovation, and initiatives began to consider whole value chains. Now we’re in the midst of another overhaul of the concept, in which considerations of impact pervade all the decision making of firms. And as for Sustainability 4.0? The 3.0 era will render the term redundant. Instead of asking either “how can we turn a profit?” or “how can we minimize our impact?” managers will see those as two sides of the same coin. Sustainability will simply be how business is done.
Putting a Price on the Priceless
The first trend contributing to Sustainability 3.0 is the recent progress on quantifying ecosystem services— that is, measuring, in dollar terms, the value of the myriad beneficial services that natural environments perform. An example is the erosion control provided by mangrove forests: How much would it cost to achieve the same control by other means? Another is the pollination that insects perform: What is it worth to agriculture? The natural world’s services range from the supply of fresh water and clean air to the sequestration of carbon and production of all manner of raw materials. If plant diversity is necessary to support new drug discoveries, what would we pay to have it?
Of course, the bounty of nature is priceless. But the unfortunate effect of our seeing these inputs to well-being as incalculable has been that they are treated as free. That mind-set creates problems when resources turn out not to be limitless or indestructible. A failure to price resources also makes it difficult to think clearly about trade-offs, which many decisions relating to sustainability involve. When inputs and outputs can be stated in like terms (which is to say, dollar terms), optimal solutions can be found.
The importance of quantifying ecosystem services was first acknowledged in the early 1990s, but serious efforts began in 2000. At least two not-for-profit organizations—Conservation International and The Nature Conservancy—and the accounting giant PriceWaterhouseCoopers are currently developing methodologies to value ecosystems. Under the direction of Peter Seligmann, Conservation International has shifted its strategy for protecting wildlands from an emphasis on their intrinsic value to stressing the value they deliver. The organization now has teams working on the arduous task of quantifying the contribution of ecosystems to human life. One product of this effort is a web-based tool called Artificial Intelligence for Ecosystem Services (ARIES), developed in partnership with the Gund Institute for Ecological Economics and with funding from the U.S. National Science Foundation, which allows users to value ecosystems rapidly and on multiple scales, from local to regional to national to global.
In 2011 Dow Chemical pledged $10 million over five years for a team of scientists from The Nature Conservancy to help Dow develop ecosystem service valuation methods. Dow’s CEO, Andrew Liveris, is determined to operationalize sustainability: “Companies that value and integrate biodiversity and ecosystem services into their strategic plans are best positioned for the future.” The Nature Conservancy will advise Dow on how to integrate ecosystem services valuation into its business practices, and the two organizations will promote this approach with the global business community.
The United Nations and the World Bank are also working on the problem. In 2001 the UN initiated the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, an initiative that convened 1,360 scientists and other experts from around the world to make trends in the health of the world’s ecosystems more visible. More recently, at the 2010 Convention on Biological Diversity, in Nagoya, Japan, World Bank president Robert Zoellick announced a major project that enables emerging and developing countries to arrive at valuations of what he calls their natural capital, to help their leaders make more-informed development decisions. “The natural wealth of nations should be a capital asset,” Zoellick said, “valued in combination with its financial capital, manufactured capital, and human capital.”
This is not just aspirational talk; serious progress is being made. Some valuations have already been released. The United Nations Environment Programme estimates, for example, that one-third of global food production depends on animal and insect pollination, and the value of this service is $200 billion annually. The World Bank, in its 2011 report “The Changing Wealth of Nations,” set the estimate for all the planet’s natural resources—its forests, rivers, wetlands, wildlands, farm and grazing lands, minerals, oil and coal, oceans, biodiversity of species—at about $44 trillion dollars, with $29 trillion belonging to developing nations.
Real change will come as high-level calculations filter down to individual companies’ bookkeeping. Puma, a sports footwear and apparel brand that is a subsidiary of the French PPR Group (which also includes Gucci, Stella McCartney, and Yves Saint Laurent) announced in April 2011 that it would begin issuing an environmental profit & loss statement that will account for the full economic impact of the brand on its ecosystem. It commissioned PriceWaterhouseCoopers to help develop the EP&L statement, and both companies hope to create a model robust enough to be adopted by others. “This is nothing to do with corporate social responsibility and the green agenda,” Chris Knight, of PwC’s sustainability practice, told The Financial Times. “It is hard-nosed economics.”
Calculations and accounting like this will pave the way for companies to internalize costs they have ignored in the past as externalities. Forward-looking corporations will have the information they need to set priorities and make decisions that reduce and mitigate their impacts. It may be hard to imagine such enlightened efforts being undertaken at a scale that would materially reduce the impact of manufacturing and agriculture on the planet’s ecosystems. None of the players that could potentially drive this scale—retailers, consumers, governments—are demanding such action in any organized or sustained way. But another catalyst is emerging that could influence these players and help us reach Sustainability 3.0. This is the second trend, one that is gathering force in the capital markets.
Funding the High Road
Just as important as the progress in ecosystems services valuation have been recent shifts in the world of socially responsible investing. SRI is a familiar term—for decades an established segment of the investment community has believed that it can and should influence corporations to show leadership in environmental sustainability, social justice, and corporate governance practices. What has changed is the orientation of this influence. Until recently, SRI generally focused on screening out the negative aspects of a given company or a sector.
The 1960s brought the first real wave of activism directed at investors. Shareholders of companies like Dow Chemical were pressured to divest or be considered complicit in producing wartime matériel. Later, in the 1970s and 1980s, pension funds took heat for making investments in companies not perceived to be aligned with the goals and values of labor unions. As the rise of mutual funds turned average citizens into investors, niche funds were established to provide assurance to the socially minded that their money was not supporting business activities they found objectionable. Managers of such funds employed negative screens, filtering out “sin stocks” like the purveyors of tobacco, alcohol, gambling, and pornography and later companies with black marks on their labor or human rights reputations. The Ariel Fund, for example, screens for environmental impact, tobacco, weapons, nuclear energy, and lack of diversity. PIMCO’s Total Return Fund III for institutional investors refuses to invest in any company engaging in “the operation of gambling casinos, the provision of health care services, or the manufacture of alcohol, tobacco products, pharmaceuticals, pornography, or military equipment.”
As awareness of SRI’s influence has grown, however, there has been a fundamental shift from a negative to a positive orientation, and to a more sophisticated appreciation of enterprise risk. Investors now see that companies’ water use, carbon emissions, stance toward labor, and supply chain management practices have a material impact on their valuations. Even as purely qualitative concerns, they have quantitative consequences; managing for greater sustainability can generate cost savings, but it can also identify and eliminate risks, create positive associations with a brand, and help to establish the kind of reputation that attracts talent. So investors increasingly seek out companies with positive environmental, social, and governance performance not because they are morally admirable but because they are more viable in the long run. Accordingly, the preferred terminology has shifted from “socially responsible” to “sustainable” investing.
Companies that want access to such rewards must voluntarily provide a level of transparency into their operations that goes beyond regulatory reporting requirements. Investors rely on sources like the Global Reporting Initiative (a standard used by 2,000 companies worldwide to report their environmental, social, and economic performance) and the Carbon Disclosure Project for insight into corporate practices and results. Both of these initiatives bring businesses to the table with stakeholders to set appropriate sustainability goals based on industry benchmarks and to identify best practices for reaching them.
The Global Reporting Initiative, for example, has documented more than 200 valuable activities that sustainable companies undertake in four areas: governance, stakeholder engagement, disclosure, and performance. Examples include an initiative to achieve zero emissions by a PepsiCo Frito-Lay potato chip factory in Arizona; an IBM facility’s success in cutting annual energy and water use by $3 million even as it increased output by 33%; a project at General Mills to help broccoli farmers switch from furrow irrigation to a drip method requiring half the water, saving nearly 1.2 billion gallons a year; and operational changes at retailer The Gap that saved suppliers’ employees from excessive overtime hours. When companies use standardized protocols like the Global Reporting Initiative to report their progress, investors are better able to evaluate companies’ relative performance.
Does greater transparency allow the funds to achieve higher investment returns? In some cases, yes; it is a misconception that if stock-picking is guided by social responsibility, subpar market returns must be accepted. Proof comes from the MSCI KLD Social 400 Index (formerly the Domini Social Index), which over the past 20 years has outperformed the S&P 500 on an actual and a risk-adjusted basis. The creators of the index began by looking at the entire set of the Fortune 500 and then stripped out the 250 that fell in the lower half on sustainability performance. They replaced those with comparable stocks from companies with better environmental, social, and governance track records. In other words, the index ignores traditional Wall Street quantitative metrics (cash flows, revenue, and so on) and bases its composition on ESG factors.
Still the perception lingers in many quarters that sustainable investing leads to lower market returns because it limits the universe of securities to draw from. Whenever nonfinancial considerations are taken into account, fewer companies are left in the mix and some financial high performers are specifically excluded. Indeed, the highest performers may well be screened out, given that the easiest way to boost a bottom line is to externalize as many costs as possible to the planet and society. And the competitive disadvantage of doing the right thing can be high in an industry where rivals get away with doing the wrong things. A company that resolves to go beyond what local law requires—by paying employees a living wage, for example, or ensuring factories do no undue harm to river systems—is hobbled by costs that its “leaner” counterparts don’t incur. For these reasons, many would-be social investors have felt forced to choose between maximizing returns and investing with a conscience. To “vote with your dollars” has seemed an act of altruism.
But here, again, the tide is turning. It’s hard for a company to come out ahead at the expense of society if its practices—depleting essential natural resources, for instance—result in a serious disruption to its business in the long term. Even harder if its decisions come back to bite it in a massive lawsuit, which is far more likely in an age of rising awareness and activism. Today, an exposé of a supply chain—like the ones depicted in Annie Leonard’s “Story of Stuff” web-based documentaries—can spread with a click of a mouse and quickly go viral. Organizations like WITNESS enable ordinary citizens with mobile devices to capture images of negative impacts and add them to a growing pile of evidence. WITNESS calls this “video advocacy” and urges people to “See It, Film It, Change It!” As the parties affected by corporate activity move rapidly from being atomized to getting organized, sophisticated fund managers now see the material risks associated with sustainability issues, and consequently they have shifted their focus from companies with lower expenses to companies better positioned to sidestep the biggest threats investors perceive to their continued growth.
One last consideration driving fund managers toward sustainability-focused investments is hard to prove but widely suspected: Companies taking the lead in environmental, social, and governance matters have better management teams. If that’s true—and the proposition makes sense given that sustainability innovation is complex and requires real talent—it would clearly pay off in many ways.
Surely all these considerations have contributed to the fact that today nearly one in every eight investment dollars goes to a company that qualifies as a socially responsible investment. Investors are seeing more and more examples where even their assumption of higher costs is disproved. By innovating more closely with suppliers, customers, and others in their value chain, companies in every industry are finding ways to reduce impacts that save money—and not simply by shifting their own footprint to someone else’s operations but by cutting the costs incurred and waste produced across the system.
Think back to the first trend, calculating the costs of externalities: The developments in the investing world go hand in hand with it. As more investors recognize the usefulness of a real cost balance sheet—that is, one that includes formerly externalized costs and benefits—the initiatives to value ecosystem services gain relevance and traction. Still, investors would like assurance that the most responsible companies would be those most likely to succeed in revenue terms. That’s where the third trend comes in.
Converging on Value Chain Indices
The last trend of real importance is the work under way to draw up what we call value chain indices. A value chain index (VCI) provides a way to make apples-to-apples comparisons of products on the basis of the impacts that accrue to them at each phase of their journey from raw material to consumed, discarded good. Developed jointly by multiple players in an industry, a VCI draws on objective data produced by life-cycle analysis efforts and covers a range of categories, such as land use, water, energy, carbon, toxics, and social welfare.
This has been the focus of, for example, The Sustainability Consortium, a diverse group of companies, universities, and government organizations working on methodologies for extracting life-cycle assessment data from their supply chains in order to reveal impact hot spots. A VCI uses such data to set realistic parameters within each category and provides a basis for weighing categories against one another to give priority to impacts deemed to have the most negative consequences. In this way, a VCI generates a rating for a specific product that can be compared against a benchmark and offers options for mitigating those impacts.
To understand the importance of today’s emerging VCIs, it’s useful to note how their antecedents, which were far more limited in scope, have fallen short. For over a decade now, raw-materials buyers and other managers in companies seeking to reduce environmental and social impacts in their supply chains have relied on standards and certifications, often from third parties, that usually address only one impact category. An example is Ikea’s use of the Forest Stewardship Council, an independent network of third-party certifiers that accredits sustainable logging and forest management practices. Currently Ikea uses FSC-certified wood in 24% of its solid wood products. To reach its goal of 100% of its solid wood meeting its standards for sustainable logging, it will need to work with additional “preferred sources” that have their own certifications. And even then, it will have to turn to still other certifiers and standards bodies to manage the other impacts of those wood products, from the greenhouse gases emitted by their manufacture and transportation to their end-of-life disposal.
A dizzying array of certifications has cropped up in response to the growing number of companies hoping to manage impacts better and communicate those improvements to their customers. Those standards compete and overlap in multitudinous ways. Value chain indices address that confusion with a single, much simpler and more effective standard for an industry. As with any corporate index, a VCI gains power to the extent that it is applied consistently across most or all firms in a sector, and also applied over time to track relative performance.
The Sustainable Apparel Coalition, a group we are closely involved in, was launched two years ago, when Patagonia asked Walmart to get behind an effort to create a value chain index for our industry. Our companies invited other corporate sustainability leaders in the apparel and footwear sectors, as well as key NGO and academic stakeholders, to tackle the hard work of developing and implementing the VCI. We realized that we would gain more momentum and have more impact if we worked together from the outset. In just 18 months this coalition has expanded to include 40 companies that together represent over 30% of the global market share for apparel and footwear. (For more, see the sidebar “How to Create a Value Chain Index in Your Sector.”) In the fall of 2011 the group completed a prototype VCI, and all members have begun road testing it in their supply chains. This initial version uses qualitative indicators to measure impacts across a product’s value chain, except in the materials category, where the impacts were measured using quantitative life-cycle data. The next version, on track to be released in the second half of 2012, will use quantitative measurements in all impact categories.
How to Create a Value Chain Index in Your Sector
The speed with which this group has aligned itself and moved forward has frankly been astounding. As the tool has taken shape, its potential has become clear; in particular, the design of the tool to provide three distinct views of performance—at the brand level, the factory level, and the individual product level—means that decisions at all levels can now be informed by sustainability considerations.
To appreciate how these three views mitigate impacts, imagine the CEO of a casual-apparel maker in a meeting with the head merchant of the company’s largest customer. The merchant declines to place an order, informing the CEO that the brand’s overall VCI rating is too low to meet the retailer’s standards. Having lost the sale, the CEO tells the VP of design that all products for next season must have cumulatively better VCI ratings. The VP conveys this directive to his team. A designer on the team starts work on a cotton blouse. She begins by specifying traditionally grown cotton, but her design software tells her that the VCI rating for that material falls short of the new sustainability goals. She then selects a vendor offering organically grown cotton, but the score is still low because she has sourced the cotton in western China, where irrigation is drawing down an aquifer faster than rainfall can replenish it. Scanning the VCI tables, she lights upon another option, a vendor in southern India buying from farms that are watered by the region’s rainfall. She completes her selection of materials and reaches the sustainability score she and her bosses have targeted.
The companies in the apparel coalition are enthusiastic about the VCI’s clear role in helping their executives, managers, and employees make better choices based on fuller awareness of their consequences. But few of the companies in the coalition, as far as we know, foresee how the creation of a value chain index will help to usher in a new era of sustainability.
The Road Map to Sustainability 3.0
What happens when the trends we’ve just described combine to fuel one another? Breakthroughs of five types—all long sought but only now becoming the natural course of business.
Outcome 1: Valuations of ecosystem services are integrated into VCIs.
We described above how VCIs produce ratings of products and brands based on their environmental and social impacts. But what if instead all these impacts could be stated in dollar terms? That is precisely what happens when ecosystem service valuations are applied to VCIs: Not only does the blouse designer in our previous example get a better rating for selecting sustainably grown organic cotton, the VCI also shows her the economic impact of that choice. She will see the “true costs” in dollars of her various options. Not only will her company meet its biggest customers’ demands for lowered impacts, its CFO will also have the information needed to compile and share an environmental P&L statement like Puma’s. And as the true costs of manufacturing products become visible, any decisions to lower those costs will be dramatically leveraged to the company’s benefit, because they will likewise be visible to fund managers and bankers.
Outcome 2: Investors learn to rely on value chain indices.
Imagine a moment in the near future when VCIs have become prevalent. Will they be of interest to equity fund managers? Yes, of course—in two distinct ways. First, investors will benefit as the “brand view” afforded by a VCI gives them a means of comparing the sustainability performance of publicly traded companies. It will not take long for it to dawn on fund managers that, at any stage in the value chain, a company that earns better ratings than its competitors will be rewarded with business from downstream customers seeking to keep their own cumulative ratings competitive. VCI ratings become harbingers of revenue.
From there, it’s a short hop to the second way that fund managers will use VCIs. A sophisticated fund manager, accessing the same VCI tool as our blouse designer, would spot—perhaps faster than the designer would—the fact that her firm’s cotton order is more likely to go to India than China. What’s more, that investor knows her firm is not the only one making sourcing decisions using this VCI. It’s hard to imagine that the savvy fund manager in possession of that insight would not act on it: The obvious move would be to invest in companies involved in sustainable cotton production and processing in India. In this way, developers of new technologies that lower the environmental impact of manufacturing and agriculture will be met with both grateful customers and eager investors.
Outcome 3: Trillion dollar markets open up. As VCI metrics turn into a reliable proxy for value, banks will take notice. It will be evident that a better VCI score helps value chain players grow share while reducing risk—and increases their access to low-cost capital. Indeed the entire financial services industry will respond in creative ways to this new reality, and also to companies’ new ability to value ecosystem services and create environmental P&Ls, as Dow and Puma are doing. As valuations and impacts become more measurable and auditable, basements full of quants at J.P. Morgan Chase will get busy working on related instruments. Consider that, as the true value of clean oceans, rivers, and forests becomes clear and acknowledged by businesses around the world, a multitrillion dollar market becomes visible.
Once this happens, everything changes. Smart money will flow to the ends of the earth in a quest to “go long” on profitable value chains with the lowest all-in cost to the planet, whereas value chains with high true costs will increasingly be viewed with greater concern, and will be subject to lower ratings and higher costs of capital.
Outcome 4: Comprehensive product ratings guide consumer choices.
We have mentioned the problem of fragmentation in ecolabels development. This is a problem in consumer-facing markets as well. According to a recent survey, more than 400 certifications and green marks are already in use, and their proliferation is still accelerating. Together they make for a bewildering set of arbiters.
Companies are now recognizing that consumers respond resoundingly when, in considering products in a category, they’re presented with one, uniform rating. Look at the success of the Energy Star rating in appliances. Inspired by that success, but eager to consider more than one dimension of performance (Energy Star looks only at energy efficiency), the electronics industry created its EPEAT standard in 2006 to provide a consumer-facing rating accounting for more than 50 environmental criteria, including use of heavy metals and toxic flame retardants. Another positive development is the Good Guide Rating, applied to 100,000 products in 600 categories by specialist teams of chemists, toxicologists, environmental life-cycle assessment experts, and nutritionists. Consumers can search for a product on the Good Guide website or use a smartphone app to scan a product’s bar code and see a rating.
Now consider the prospect of one uniform rating equally accessible to consumers but based on a VCI like the one the Sustainable Apparel Coalition has developed. This would combine the appeal of a rating methodology as rigorous as Energy Star’s, a set of considerations as broad as Good Guide’s, and the coverage of an entire industry’s products. Further, given the transparency of the data and calculations involved, consumers could delve deeper into a rating if they chose. Imagine, in other words, a shopper with a smartphone scrolling down to see the subratings in a category of particular importance to her. Perhaps few would actually do so, but the availability of the data would only add to the credibility of the rating.
Outcome 5: Value chain indices inform regulation—and a new era of innovation.
Once a voluntary global standard is being used by enough key stakeholders, the alignment will yield the political will for policy measures that ensure that the true costs of products across all sectors and markets are reflected in their price. Even without such alignment (and notwithstanding the failure of the Copenhagen climate conference) we are seeing interesting legislation proposed. Regimes like “cap and dividend”—which proposes to tax carbon suppliers, raise the price of energy-intensive products and services, and then rebate all those costs back to consumers— would surely drive rapid market-based innovation.
Already, there are laws on the books that advance the effort to internalize externalized costs. The UK’s Climate Change Act, passed in 2008, creates a legally binding framework for greenhouse gas reductions of 24% by 2020 and 80% by 2050, against a 1990 baseline. California AB 32, passed in 2006, requires a statewide 25% reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 against a 1990 baseline. And Grenelle II, a French law, is already requiring certain consumer products to carry labels that disclose total GHG emissions and two other environmental impacts associated with the product.
It is important to note that Grenelle II hit a snag after its passage in 2010. The law was to go into effect in January 2011, but the French National Assembly postponed implementation following heavy lobbying by an influential economic sector. The initial phase of the law is experimental yet involves 1,000 products made or traded by 168 companies.
Value chain indices like the Sustainable Apparel Coalition’s could provide the data Grenelle II requires. For the French government, with its law already on the books, that would be a godsend; the coalition currently is inviting the French government to participate in the development of its index.
Data, Vision, and Will
The global population is projected to grow from 6.9 billion people to perhaps 9 billion by 2050. Even if we only want things to stay the same, practices must change. It isn’t a question of whether business will radically transform, but only of when and how. Progress will be fastest if we can create a system in which the products that cause the least harm also have the lowest price. But three keys to reaching that goal have been lacking in the past: data, vision, and will.
Today, at least one of those is in place. It is now possible to collect accurate-enough data to assign true costs to goods sold. We see many signs of gathering will, too: The trends outlined here are being driven in large part by passionate businesspeople. That leaves only vision. We believe our road map to sustainable business offers that vision. In a world where true costs are reflected in products, selfish impulses will serve public-minded ones; the investors that seek the highest returns will become those who seek the highest responsibility.
Like most “holy grail” objectives, sustainability as a firm’s most dependable route to financial high performance has seemed beyond reach. But three trends, each gathering force on its own, are now combining with dramatic effect: The values of many vital aspects of our world traditionally considered externalities are being quantified so that they can be factored into economic equations. Socially responsible investing has matured beyond negative screening to become a value-seeking discipline and a positive impetus for change. And industries are converging on standard indices by which to rate products’ sustainability and seek improvements throughout their value chains. Progress in each area spurs progress in the others, with the result that the long-sought alignment of a firm’s prosperity with the best interests of the planet seems not only possible but inevitable.

ESG stands for Environmental, Social and Governance. This is also called sustainability in many cases. In a business context, sustainability is about the company’s business model, i.e. how its products and services contribute to sustainable development. It is also about a company’s risk management, i.e. how it manages its own operations to minimise negative impact.

eco-business,https://www.eco-business.com/news/16-sustainability-buzzwords-of-2020/ https://www.eco-business.com/opinion/the-four-pillars-of-singapores-sustainable-development-success/ https://www.eco-business.com/ ,"The language of sustainability professionals changed in 2020.
New words and phrases became common parlance as sustainability folk tried to make sense of one of the most calamitous years of the 21st century.
Not all of the words in this list are new to the sustainability dictionary. Some have grown in popularity with the dominant social and environmental themes of the year. Most are coronavirus-related. Some describe the state of the climate, biodiversity and equality in a year that started with forest fires, and was interspersed with growing pandemic-induced public concern over the plight of the natural world, and the killing of an African American by a policeman that set off a global movement against racial injustice.
As people and companies searched for the right words to describe themselves, not everyone managed to avoid drinking the kool aid. In a corporate blurb, one multinational nutrition firm told Eco-Business last month: “As a purpose-led, performance-driven, science-based company, we marry scientific expertise and innovative power to develop sustainable, scalable solutions.”
Here are some words and phrases that rolled off the tongues of the sustainarati in 2020:
Virus-washing
The pandemic has provided an irresistable, year-long platform for companies to talk about how much they care. McDonald’s wasn’t the only company to be accused of virus-washing this year, when the fast food giant divided its golden arches logo to show solidarity with the need to social distance.
Build back better
First used at a United Nations conference on future disaster avoidance in 2015, the term became popular this year as the rallying cry of US presidential hopeful Joe Biden, who promised economic recovery for the millions of unemployed Americans if he won the White House, and to take on racial injustice and climate change at the same time. Since then, politicians and business leaders all over the world have been using the phrase (some preferring “green recovery”, another popular buzzword in 2020), promising citizens and consumers a brighter, more sustainable future. South Korea is among the few Asian countries to make sustainability central to economic recovery plans.
Shecession
The uneven impact of the global economic downturn on women. Unlike the 2008/2009 global financial crisis, which disproportionately impacted men, the pandemic-induced economic contraction has been harder on women, noted C Nicole Mason, president and chief executive of the Institute for Women’s Policy Research in the United States. She used the term “shecession” to describe a recession that was hurting predominantly non-white, females in the US. Globally, the pandemic has hit young, low-income families the hardest, particularly in countries reliant on global trade, tourism, commodity exports, and external financing. Among the hardest hit sectors in Southeast Asia has been recycling, with a contraction in trade in recycled goods all but wiping out jobs for millions of informal workers.
Net zero
In July, United Nations secretary-general António Guterres said in a speech to Tsinghua University that there was “no excuse” for humanity to fail to limit global warming to 1.5ºC, which means the world must achieve net-zero emissions before 2050, and cut emissions by half by 2030. That speech, and the UN’s Race to Zero campaign, has prompted more than 100 countries and 1,500 companies worth US$11.4 trillion to make net-zero promises. Net zero has replaced carbon neutral as the more popular term.
Sanitary cities
The pandemic prompted city planners to think about how to redesign cities to protect the health of residents and support “sanitary lifestyles”. In the Italian town of Vicchio, squares were painted in the town centre to help people social distance in public, while in Domino Park in Brooklyn, white circles on the grass indicated the safe distance for people to keep physically apart.
Nature-based solutions
Talk about how to combat climate change and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by burning less fossil fuels has dominated conversations about how to avert planetary catastrophe, with little thought spared for environmental conservation — until 2020, when the business world started talking more about using natural ecosystems to curb emissions. In Singapore this year, a plan is hatching to use nature-based solutions to lay the foundations for a carbon credits market.
Woke
A word that until recently meant being aware of and responsive to social and racial injustice, is now more likely to signifiy pretentiousness and cultural elitism, opined the Guardian in January. First used by African American communities in the 1960s, woke experienced a resurgence on the back of the Black Lives Matter movement and entered the Oxford Engish dictionary in 2017. But in 2020 woke shifted “from virtue signal to dog whistle” for the self-righteous.
Carbonomics
In a year of net-zero targets, carbonomics was used in conversations about the cost of decarbonisation. Popular in environmental, social and governance investing circles, it was used this year by Bloomberg for its Future of Energy show and Goldman Sachs in its The Green Engine of Economic Recovery report.
Biocontributive (or regenerative)
Consumers increasingly want to buy into brands with the smallest possible environmental footprint, but brands are increasingly saying that they can do better — by restoring the resources they use. Biocontributive, regenerative or carbon-positive brands are now in demand, and go one step further than companies talking about carbon offsetting and carbon neutrality. Agriculture and tourism were the two sectors that talked most about regeneration in 2020.
Climate (or planet-based) diets
The first thing anyone can do to reduce their impact on the planet is eat differently. Climate diets are now a thing, with eating less meat and drinking less coffee well thought of among climate-minded dieticians. A study in January found that half of American consumers say they don’t eat meat for environmental reasons, and one in five millennials have changed their diet to shrink their environmental footprint.
The perfect earth-friendly diet depends on where you live, according to a study by World Wide Fund for Nature, Bending the Curve: The Restorative Power of Planet-Based Diets. The report comes with a calculator that works out the best “planet-based” diets for each country. In Sweden, if everyone ate less meat, emissions would fall by half. In Indonesia, if everyone had enough to eat, emissions would inevitably rise regardless of the type of food consumed.
Agritourism (or agrotourism)
For people who have little regular contact with the countryside, agrotourism teaches city folk about life on a farm, and how the food they eat is grown. This increasingly popular vacation option could be a lifeline for struggling tourism and hospitality businesses. Banyan Tree Hotels & Resorts pivoted to agrotourism in June by partnering with a boutique farming collective to open an organic farm in Thailand.
Genderless fashion
Gender equality was no longer enough in 2020. So the fashion business has started designing clothing that is gender neutral, genderless, or gender inclusive. “People don’t want to be defined by what someone tells them is right for them or isn’t,” said Chris Walsh, UK vice-president of sportswear brand Adidas, in an interview with Vogue this year. “It used to be that pastel colours were very gender-specific, but we don’t see that anymore. We just produce the best shoes and allow people to adopt them however they want to.”
The isolation economy
Social distancing and lockdowns have spawned a trade in services that keep people productive and entertained while stuck at home. But those same forces have also brought about mental health issues such as increased aggression towards unfamiliar people, loneliness, low self-esteem, and fear — a payday for psychologists.
Guerilla gardening
In a year when more people than ever worried about how to feed themselves, guerilla gardening — the cultivation of plants (usually edibles) on land that the grower does not own — returned to vogue. In countries such as land-scarce Singapore, there were even calls for military land to be turned into edible forests. Food security was a matter of national security, conservationists argued.
Intentional communities (or eco enclaves)
For those who have the means of escape, intentional communities have become in-demand places to move to this year. Not to be confused with communes, intentional communities are towns built with a specific spiritual or political beliefs in mind. Many have sustainability, wellness, and land conservation as guiding principles. For instance, the town of Serenbe in the United States was constructed near a woodland, houses are built using a traditional form of Japanese carpentry, and organic farms grow native crops. In recent years, the number of intentional communities, or eco enclaves, has ballooned globally to more than 1,200, according to the Foundation for Intentional Community, a non-profit that supports these experimental towns.
Bee-washing
The decline of an animal hailed as the most important living thing to humanity has not been lost on brands with an eye for environmental issues that generate buzz. Albert Einstein once said that if bees disappear, humans would have four years to live. Seventy per cent of the world’s agriculture depends exclusively on bees, but bee populations have plummeted as a result of deforestation and the uncontrolled use of pesticides. Latching on to this problem, companies in Europe and the United States have started to claim their products are bee-friendly or run CSR programmes to “save the bees”.

Find out more and join The EB Circle . Since the 1970s, economic development has helped to lift billions of people out of poverty. Social indices of human development such as healthcare and education have improved significantly.
But this progress is not even, and important challenges remain. Social inequality, education and work opportunities for women, and youth unemployment are still areas of concern for many countries.
Rising populism and protectionism in several advanced economies, technological disruptions, and new transnational security and pandemic threats add more complexity and uncertainty to health, safety, and development.
Our environment is also under stress. Since 1972, the world population has grown from 3.8 billion to 7.3 billion in 2015, and is expected to grow to 9.7 billion by 2050. More than 54 per cent of the global population already lives in urban areas.
Access to clean air, clean water, power, and sanitation are challenges in many countries. Low-lying coastal communities such as Singapore are also more vulnerable to rising sea levels due to climate change.
Individuals, companies, countries, and the global community will need to work together to develop solutions for sustainable development.
As a small, densely populated island nation with no natural resources, Singapore’s own sustainable development experience has focused on four key areas: Building a sustainable economy; creating a sustainable living environment; ensuring sustainable development for our people; and contributing to international collaboration.
Sustainable economy
Economic growth generates the resources to invest in education, research and development, security, infrastructure, and public services.
With no natural resources, Singapore has had to be resourceful to make a living for ourselves. This has entailed finding ways to create and add value, producing goods and services that are in demand by others, and making careful use of resources.
This has required integrated and long-term planning to optimise resources such as budget, land, manpower, energy, and more recently, carbon emissions, to ensure sustainable growth.
We made early choices to turn away very pollutive industries and took early action to switch to natural gas, the cleanest form of fossil fuel, for power generation. Today, we are among the 20 most carbon efficient countries in the world.
We will intensify our efforts as we work towards achieving our commitment under the Paris Agreement. We will reduce emissions intensity by 36 per cent from 2005 levels by 2030, and stabilise emissions with the aim of peaking by then.
We plan to introduce a carbon tax from 2019 so that those who emit the most carbon emissions will bear the cost to our environment and be encouraged to reduce their emissions. There is also much potential for our industries to save costs as we raise energy efficiency.
The carbon tax will also help align the costs and benefits of reducing emissions. We are also scaling up deployment for solar, aggregating demand across our agencies and testing floating solar photovoltaics on our reservoirs.
These plans can help us to move towards a low-carbon society, and also be a Living Laboratory for businesses, agencies, and research institutes to develop new products and services for the global economy.
According to the recently launched ‘Better Business, Better World” Asia report, opportunities in sustainability could contribute US$12 trillion to global GDP and create 380 million new jobs by 2030. I encourage our businesses to seize these opportunities.
Sustainable living environment
Our pioneer generation had a vision for a clean, green and sustainable Singapore for all Singaporeans. They instilled in all of us the consciousness that this little island is all that we have, and we have to look after it well.
Over the past 50 years, we have seen vast improvements in our housing, water, public health, and sanitation. Today, we are a City in a Garden with about 47 per cent green cover in Singapore. More than 80 per cent of households are within a 10-minute walk from a park.
We have 72 hectares of rooftop gardens and green walls today, and aim to triple this by 2030. These plans are outlined in our Sustainable Singapore Blueprint.
I have also just launched the Public Sector Sustainability Plan, which will catalyse sustainable practices, generate demand for green products and services, and encourage our public officers to think green. These initiatives will achieve a green and sustainable living environment for all Singaporeans.
“
With no natural resources, Singapore has had to be resourceful to make a living for ourselves. This has entailed finding ways to create and add value, producing goods and services that are in demand by others, and making careful use of resources.
Sustainable development for our people
Our people are our precious and only resource, and investing in them is of utmost importance.
Since the 1960s, we have worked to achieve mass education at the primary, secondary, and tertiary levels. Our next frontier is mass continuing education to prepare for the future of work. Rapid technological advances will change the nature of work and the skills required.
The knowledge and skills we acquire through conventional pre-employment education during the first 20 years of our lives will need to be refreshed to last a working life of over forty years.
Our workers must be prepared to constantly upskill and reskill, and move into new jobs and industries several times in their working lives. SkillsFuture Singapore will work closely with our associations, unions, and companies to support our workers to deepen and refresh their skills at key points in their careers.
International collaboration
Nations also need to work together to address global challenges. Issues such as transboundary air pollution or pandemics require a regional response, while others such as climate change require the contribution of all countries.
Singapore remains committed to the Paris Agreement and supports the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which provides a framework to guide national efforts in achieving the 17 Sustainable Development Goals.
In support of this agenda, we have trained more than 112,000 officials from over 170 developing countries in key areas such as sustainable urban, water, and human resource management, health, and education.
We will continue to share our sustainable development policies and expertise through leadership seminars in policymaking, workshops on urban governance in cities, and water and sanitation projects.
In the course of our development journey, Singapore has benefited from the experience of many countries as we developed, and we continue to do so. We hope that our collaborations in sustainable development can, in a similar way, make a small contribution to the development paths and journeys of other countries.
Through international partnerships, we can collectively find more efficient, more comprehensive, and more sustainable solutions to address global challenges.
The four aspects of sustainable development that I have highlighted work in combination with one another. Strong partnership between the public, private, and people sectors will be required to shape a sustainable future for all of us.

Of top Australian and New Zealand companies that referenced the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in their reporting, climate change was the most widely included of all, according to a review released this week.
Forty nations — producers of 80% of annual carbon emissions — made pledges of heightened climate ambition last week at US President Joe Biden’s Leaders Summit on Climate but activists pointed to the abysmal lack of action by those nations.
For a developed country, Singapore's domestic recycling rate was already low, at 17 per cent. Covid has been blamed for pushing down recycling rates further, although less waste was generated last year compared to 2019.
In the leadup to the 'Our Planet, Our Future' Nobel Prize Summit, a new report says that emerging technologies, social innovations, and different approaches to biosphere stewardship are paving the way for a more sustainable future.

Background: Poplar tree plantations for wood production are part of a worldwide growing trend, especially in moist soil sites. Harvesting operations in moist sites such as poplar plantations require more study for detailed and increased knowledge on environmental and economic aspects and issues. Methods: In this study, the effects of soil moisture content (dry vs. moist) on productivity, cost, and emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) caused by operations of different harvesting systems (chainsaw-skidder and harvester-forwarder) were evaluated in three poplar plantations (two in Italy and one in Iran). Results: The productivity (m3 h−1) of both systems in the dry sites were significantly higher (20% to 30%) than those in the moist sites. Production costs (€ m−3) and GHG emissions (g m−3) of both systems in the dry sites were also significantly lower than those in the moist sites. The productivity of the harvester-forwarder system was about four times higher, and its production cost was 25% to 30% lower than that of the chainsaw-skidder system, but the calculated GHG emissions by harvester-forwarder system was 50–60% higher than by the chainsaw-skidder system. Conclusions: Logging operations are to be avoided where there are conditions of high soil moisture content (>20%). The result will be higher cost-effectiveness and a reduction in the emission of pollutants.

Sustainable production and consumption can be defined as production and use of products and services in a manner that is socially beneficial, economically viable and environmentally benign over their whole life cycle. The journal aims to provide a leading platform for publishing high-quality interdisciplinary papers on research and practice in this emerging field. It looks uniquely at the interactions between technology, consumption and policy to help identify more-sustainable solutions for both production and consumption systems.
Papers from engineers, natural and social scientists as well as philosophers are invited and those at the interface between these disciplines are particularly encouraged. Types of article published by the journal include original research, perspectives, short communications, policy and review papers.
All papers should include some elements of life cycle thinking and should clearly demonstrate that they are addressing topics related to sustainable production and consumption. Note that papers on end-of-pipe treatment technologies are outside the scope.

thesustainabilityawards,http://thesustainabilityawards.com/ ,"Challenging us to take a rigorous and holistic view, the Sustainability Awards sets the agenda on best practice, turns the spotlight on the most important areas of R&D, and helps separate greenwash from the innovations that make a genuine difference.
Sustainability Awards is independently judged by an expert jury representing a cross-section of the international packaging value chain, including leading brand owners and retailers, sustainability organisations, waste management, academia and industry experts. Each year the competition sees ever growing engagement, assessing submissions from start-ups and global brands by the same, carefully considered criteria.
29-30 SEPTEMBER 2021 | FACHPACK, NUREMBERG | COMBINED WITH YEAR-ROUND VIRTUAL CONTENT
The winners of the Sustainability Awards 2020 2021 willbe announced as part of the wider programme of panels, workshops and networkingevents in comprising theSustainable Packaging Summit 20202021. Followingthe success of last year’s season of live virtual events, thisyear we will be combining year-round digital sessions with physicalevents in the autumn, culminating in the Sustainability Awards ceremony andSustainable Packaging Summit at FachPack in Nuremberg, Germany, on 29-30September. To join the value chain,regulators, NGOs and recyclers in discussion of key dilemmas while keepingeveryone safe in this time of pandemic, we’re hosting this year’s Summit as aseason of virtual events throughout October and November 2020. You’rewelcome to join us online and in person
Once the Sustainable Packaging Summit is finished, we invite everyone to stay at PackBox Forum for the Sustainability Awards winner announcements, trophy presentations, drinks and nibbles, and continuing discussion of responsible packaging!

Submit your sustainable packaging innovation or initiative. Entries can be submitted (there’s no charge to participate) via our online platform between 25 January and 24 March 2021. Full instructions and rules can be found in the Essential Information section below.
The winners of the 2021 Sustainability Awards will be announced on 29 September, as part of the Sustainable Packaging Summit at FachPack in Nuremberg, Germany.
Throughout this year, the Sustainability Awards serves as a focal point to share innovation strategies, discuss best practice, and cross-fertilise ideas. To participate in this conversation or simply ensure you receive updates on the competition, sign up to our newsletter and follow @packagingeurope.
No! Participation in the competition is free of charge.
Once you have created a user account in the competition platform, simply fill in the submission form. This consists of several fields. but the key criteria on which entries are judged are 1) a statement outlining the entry and what is innovative about it, and 2) the impact it has had or is projected to have. There is a limit of 600 words for each of these sections. You can also link to an external web page with additional information or a video about your submission. Please also upload an image of the innovation or initiative so it can be included in articles about the competition. You can save your entry and finish it later. Don’t forget to complete all sections of the form by 20th May!
The innovations or achievements entered into the competition must have been launched or announced no earlier than 1 April 2018.
There is a maximum of three entries per submitting organisation. Large organisations with multiple business units are encouraged to coordinate internally to decide which innovations or initiatives to nominate.
No, you can only submit a particular product or initiative in one category. Otherwise, Packaging Europe reserves the right to withdraw the submission from one or all categories. Please read the category descriptions carefully before deciding which is the most appropriate one.
The closing date for entries will be midnight (CET) at the end of 20 May 2019.
A selection of industry experts representing the whole value chain will vote independently on the submissions, resulting in the winners for each category. The overall winner ‘Best Sustainable Packaging Innovation’ will be the entry representing a particular innovation that accrues the highest overall score across all categories. In the event that the highest scoring entry is not an innovation per se, e.g. if it is a broad sustainability strategy entered into the ‘Best Practice’ category, this will not be considered for the ‘Best Sustainable Packaging Innovation’ prize.
Please read the specific criteria for each category. In general, the core principle of the awards is to reward the project or product that, in the judges’ view, has the greatest significance in terms of its positive impact on sustainability. This can be understood either in its immediate performance metrics or in the potential transformative impact –i.e. there isn’t necessarily a stronger weighting to commercialised products over early-stage R&D breakthroughs. Judges are also instructed to consider the holistic implications for sustainability, even when the category emphasises a particular aspect. For example, if the criterion is ‘resource efficiency’, the winning entry should not simply be the one with the biggest weight reduction, but also offer a viable solution that does not result in reduced performance according to other environmental criteria. The more factual information you can provide –including any relevant supporting data –the more likely the judges are to accept your claims. You are encouragedto provide links to additional information, videos, etc.
Yes! Although a single user must submit the entry, you can list all involved stakeholders. We welcome collaborative entries such as packaging innovations developed jointly between a brands and packaging companies, and multi-stakeholder projects.
The jury will complete the first round of judging by the end of June. If your submission is selected as one of the 24 finalists (the top four in each of the six competition categories), judges may request additional information / clarifications from you at this stage, if they believe this may be important in selecting the eventual winners. In any case, the 24 finalists will be celebrated at the Sustainability Awards 2019 ceremony at FachPack on 25 September.
Because of the sheer number of entries it is not feasibleto provide feedback on all entries. However, we will invite judges to share their comments about the 24 finalists.
The winners will be revealedat the Sustainability Awards 2019 ceremony on the afternoon of Wednesday 25 September at the PackBox Forum at FachPack, in Nürnberg, Germany. Everyone is welcome to join us for sustainability discussion, drinks, networking and the big announcements!
Yes. The Sustainability Awards have been recognised by the World Packaging Organization and therefore all winners are eligible to enter the WorldStars.
The Sustainability Awards is organized by Packaging Europe and judged by an independent, international panel of experts. For additional information and to submit to the Sustainability Awards, please visit thesustainabilityawards.com.
1. The core principle for each category in the competition is to reward the project or innovation that, in the judges’ view, has the greatest significance in terms of its positive impact on sustainability. This can be understood either in its immediate performance metrics or in the potential transformative impact.
2. Judges are also instructed to consider the holistic sustainability implications, even when the category emphasizes a particular attribute. For example, if the criterion is ‘resource efficiency’, the winning entry should not simply be the one with the biggest weight reduction, but also offer a viable solution that does not result in reduced performance according to other environmental criteria.
3. The Sustainability Awards promotes rigorous assessment of substantive impacts. Therefore, submissions should be supported wherever possible and appropriate by empirical data, preferably with details of testing methodology.
4. Entries to the Sustainability Awards 2020 may be submitted to the following competition categories:
5. Please note, there is an additional ‘Readers’ Award’ category, which is separate from the main Sustainability Awards. Nominations are made, and subsequently voted on, by Packaging Europe readers. For this category submissions are not accepted from the organizations responsible for the innovations and the expert judging panel has no role in selecting the winners.
6. The innovations or achievements entered into the competition must have been launched or announced no earlier than 1 January 2019.
7. Supporting information for submissions should be provided in English.
8. Please refer to the descriptions of the individual categories for information about eligibility to enter a particular category.
9. For all categories (except ‘Pre-Commercialized Innovation’) submissions that are products or technologies must be already commercially launched. If a product is not yet in commercial use, it should be submitted to the category ‘Pre-Commercialized Innovation’.
10. Packaging Europe reserves the right to change the category to which a valid submission has been entered if it deems this appropriate. Packaging Europe is not obliged to inform participants in the Sustainability Awards if it amends the category of their entry.
11. The competition is open to entries from organizations and initiatives from the following organizations:
12. The competition is open to the following types of entries:
13. Collaborative projects can be submitted as a joint entry, e.g. packaging developed jointly by a brand owner and packaging specialist. Collaborators are encouraged to work together on their submissions and share the credit.
14. There is a maximum of three entries per submitting organization. Large organizations with multiple business units are encouraged to coordinate internally to decide which innovations or initiatives to nominate. Packaging Europe reserves the right to withdraw submissions from the competition if this limitation has been exceeded. Where autonomous organizations within the same group or holding company can reasonably be considered to be effectively separate organizations, the ‘three entries’ rule may be waived. Packaging Europe reserves the right to make final judgements on such questions.
15. Participants cannot submit the same product or initiative in more than one category. Otherwise, Packaging Europe reserves the right to withdraw the submission from one or all categories.
16. If a product or innovation has been submitted to the Sustainability Awards in the past, it cannot be submitted a second time unless it has undergone sufficient advancement to be considered effectively a new entity.
17. Judges are to base their decisions on their objective assessment of the merits of entries and are instructed that no preference should be given to past or present Packaging Europe contributors, advertisers or sponsors.
18. Judges should recuse themselves from judging any submission where there is a conflict of interest, in particular if they represent or have a commercial relationship with the organization that made the submission.
19. Individual judges’ grading and comments during deliberation will remain confidential.
20. Judges access and grade the submissions through the same online portal to which entries are submitted. Judging will take place across two rounds. In the first round, sub-groups of the jury will each assess a random selection of submissions in order to select those with sufficient merit to be considered as finalists. In the second round, the entire judging panel will assess all finalists across all competition categories.
21. Judges may instruct Packaging Europe to request additional information or clarifications from the finalists following the first round of voting. On receipt, such information will be shared with judges.
22. Winners are selected based on the aggregated grades of judges. Therefore, the results cannot be attributed to the opinions of any individual judge.
23. The overall winner ‘Best Sustainable Packaging Innovation’ will be the entry representing a particular innovation or innovation project that accrues the highest overall score among the finalists in the second round of voting. In the event that the highest scoring entry is a broad sustainability strategy entered into the ‘Best Practice’ category or if it is a pre-commercialized product, this will not be considered for the ‘Best Sustainable Packaging Innovation’ prize.
Submissions open: 20 January 2020
Submissions close: 6 April 2020 at 23:59 CET
Finalists announced: 7 June 2020
Winners announced: 15 October 2020 (live at the Sustainable Packaging Summit, Lisbon)
No! Participation in the competition is free of charge.
Once you have created a user account in the competition platform, simply fill in the submission form. This consists of several fields, but the key criteria on which entries are judged are 1) a statement outlining the entry and what is innovative about it, and 2) the impact it has had or is projected to have. There is a limit of 600 words for each of these sections. You can also link to external web pages with additional information or a video about your submission. Please upload an image of the innovation or initiative, both to help the judges and so it can be included in articles about the competition. You can save your entry and finish it later. Don’t forget to complete all sections of the form by 24th March!
The innovations or achievements entered into the competition must have been launched or announced no earlier than 1 January 2020.
There is a maximum of five entries per submitting organisation. Large organisations with multiple business units are encouraged to coordinate internally to decide which innovations or initiatives to nominate.
Products that are not yet in commercial use are accepted in the category ‘Pre-Commercialized Innovation’. For all other categories, any product submitted should already be commercially launched.
The Readers’ Award is separate from the main part of the Sustainability Awards, in that nominations are made from the readers of Packaging Europe rather than the companies responsible for them. Therefore, you cannot submit your own work for this category through the main competition. The winners are also chosen by Packaging Europe readers rather than the independent judging panel.
No, you can only submit a particular product or initiative in one category. Otherwise, Packaging Europe reserves the right to withdraw the submission from one or all categories. Please read the category descriptions carefully before deciding which is the most appropriate one.
The closing date for entries will be midnight (US Pacific time) at the end of 24th March 2021.
A selection of industry experts representing the whole value chain will vote independently on the submissions. There are two rounds of voting. The first round will determine four finalists in each category. The second round will select the winners for each category, and also an overall winner ‘Best Sustainable Packaging Innovation’. In the event that the highest scoring entry is not an innovation per se, e.g. if it is a broad sustainability strategy entered into the ‘Best Practice’ category, this will not be considered for the ‘Best Sustainable Packaging Innovation’ prize.
Please read the specific criteria for each category. In general, the core principle of the awards is to reward the project or product that, in the judges’ view, has the greatest significance in terms of its positive impact on sustainability. This can be understood either in its immediate performance metrics or in the potential transformative impact –i.e. there isn’t necessarily a stronger weighting to commercialised products over early-stage R&D breakthroughs. Judges are also instructed to consider the holistic implications for sustainability, even when the category emphasises a particular aspect. For example, if the criterion is ‘resource efficiency’, the winning entry should not simply be the one with the biggest weight reduction, but also offer a viable solution that does not result in reduced performance according to other environmental criteria.

Yes! Although a single user must submit the entry, you can list all involved stakeholders. We welcome collaborative entries such as packaging innovations developed jointly between a brands and packaging companies, and multi-stakeholder projects.
Finalists will be selected in the first round of judging and announced on 17th May 2021. If your submission is selected as a finalist (i.e. one of the top four entries in one of the competition categories), judges may request additional information /clarifications from you. All 32 finalists across the eight categories will be celebrated at the Sustainability Awards 2021 ceremony at the Sustainable Packaging Summit at FachPack (28-30 September 2021).
The judges sometimes leave comments about entries. On request we can share any remarks they may have made, on an anonymous basis. Please be patient with us –this is a manual process and we have hundreds of submissions!
The winners will be revealed at a special dinner and awards ceremony at the Sustainable Packaging Summit on 29th September at FachPack, in Nuremberg, Germany.
Yes. The Sustainability Awards have been recognised by the World Packaging Organization and therefore all winners are eligible to enter the WorldStars.
The Sustainable Packaging Summit & Sustainability Awards have continued to grow in stature, attracting an ever-growing international following. Each year sees engagement rise dramatically, the standard of competition increase and the range and experience of our expert judging panel deepen.
SPONSORSHIP DOESN’T MEAN WINNING, NOR DOES IT MEAN YOU CAN’T TAKE PART.
We take pride in the nature of our awards – after all, with the planet at stake, we can’t afford to allow sponsors to buy nominations. Equally, we encourage our sponsors to enter, since the quality of our judges is always front & centre in the competition, there can be no question about the integrity our processes.
The antithesis of greenwash
Our vision is to bring together those who are truly pioneering sustainability across the value chain, flush out greenwash, focus on the opportunities which can make a real difference, and facilitate further action which helps our planet. There is no stronger way to align your brand with the future of the packaging industry than by supporting this initiative.
Beyond branding
We understand sponsorship needs to be about more than a logo on a stage or page. Supporting this initiative grants your organisation unprecedented branding across all of Packaging Europe’s significant reach – but crucially it gives you a platform for thought leadership in sustainability. This is a space for your sustainability experts to share the spotlight, and let the industry know about how your organisation is driving change.
Year-round exposure
Of course, the branding is important too! Our sponsorship packages deliver un beatable value by extending your brand visibility across an entire year of events and content. From the opening of the competition in Q1, to digital events in Q2 and live (physical or virtual)events in Q3&4, as well as a 365 networking platform, and all of this backed by the muscle of Packaging Europe’s marketing force, this is an investment which will continue to deliver value throughout the year.
Create content with lasting value
With live video sessions recorded and uploaded to YouTube, a podcast, video interview and supporting articles, sponsorship creates content which you can use in investor relations and corporate communications. Sponsorship puts the spotlight on you as a driver of innovation, collaboration and forward thinking.
This year we’re co-promoting the Sustainability Awards with our partner FachPack – the leading European trade fair in 2019, located in Nürnberg at the heart of Europe’s biggest economy. Integrated, along with our Sustainable Packaging Summit, into the official FachPack program at the climax of the expo’s busiest day, the Sustainability Awards 2019 will reach a wider audience than ever before.

nist,https://www.nist.gov/blogs/manufacturing-innovation-blog/five-benefits-embracing-sustainability-and-green-manufacturing ,"Powered by the Manufacturing Extension Partnership
Embracing sustainable and green principles is not just a trend. Cultivating sustainable and green practices helps organizations become more efficient, competitive and profitable. It’s more than simply “a good thing to do.” Manufacturers are realizing the many practical short-term and long-term financial benefits to implementing environmentally conscious improvements.
“Going green” is not the same thing as sustainability, albeit they are related. Although the terms are often used interchangeably, green is more frequently associated with a singular product or process. Examples include improving a specific operation so that it does not harm the environment or creating a product made entirely out of recycled materials.
Sustainability is typically more associated with an organization’s holistic approach; it takes the entire production process and logistics into consideration. For example, you may purchase a green product made out of recycled goods. However, if that product was made overseas, and environmentally harmful methods were used to transport that product to the United States, this would not be adhering to sustainable principles.
In the manufacturing world, it is advantageous to focus on both green and sustainability. While targeted improvements can be beneficial to your company, looking at the “bigger picture” maximizes the perks of an environmental focus. Here are five critical ways to embrace sustainability and green to positively impact your organization:
Energy and water costs are a prime concern for manufacturers. Focusing on improvements can reduce these expenses. Often, these improvements are realized as annual savings as opposed to quicker, short-term cost reductions.
Switching to energy-efficient lighting and adjusting lighting levels in accordance with your production schedule will reduce your long-term electrical costs. Regular equipment inspections will also prove beneficial. For example, air compressor leaks can be a waste of energy and increase expenses. Changing how you package your products and supplies can provide cost reductions and free up space at your facility. Solar and wind energy, along with energy efficient equipment and machinery, will greatly reduce monthly utility bills. Implementing strategies such as recycling and going paperless will also save on supply costs. Sustainability can improve your bottom-line.
Green and sustainable practices can make your company more marketable. Consumers are more conscious of the environment, and making improvements will strengthen your reputation. Whether you’re an OEM or a supplier, highlighting your initiatives to the public will help you attract a whole new base of customers, resulting in increased sales. This is important to manufacturers seeking government contracts where green manufacturing standards are often a factor.
Technology and social media have enabled buyers to easily (and publicly) promote or criticize companies for their green practices, or lack thereof.
Sustainability improvements are a collaborative effort. When employees work together to identify and implement green and sustainable initiatives, it fosters a culture of teamwork and continuous improvement. Employees work harder when they are engaged and have a sense of pride in their company. By internally communicating the importance of changes and the impact they are having on the business and environment, manufacturers will positively influence their corporate culture.
Sustainability can also ignite innovation. For example, if you challenge your engineers and machinists to reduce material scraps or recycle more waste during the manufacturing process, it often leads to additional ideas for operational improvements.
In addition to helping your company’s profitability, your actions can make a real difference. By implementing changes, you will have a smaller carbon footprint and reduce the number of toxins released into the atmosphere. Future generations ultimately benefit from improved air and water quality, fewer landfills and more renewable energy sources.
U.S. manufacturers are achieving quantifiable results by working with their local MEP Centers on sustainability and green initiatives. Some successes include:
MEP is partnering on federal initiatives to help companies: 1) gain a competitive edge by reducing environmental costs and impact, and 2) enter new markets by developing environmentally focused materials, products, and processes. For more information about MEP's sustainability efforts, visit our website or please contact your local MEP Center.

Actionable insights, practical solutions
Limiting global warming to 1.5°C will require unparalleled transformations to businesses, industries and supply chains. Investors and citizens demand action. Firms are responding: more and more are signing on to bold targets grounded in climate science. But while sustainability is far from languishing on the corporate periphery, far more effort is needed―and fast.
Over four days, The Economist’s sixth annual Sustainability Week will provide actionable insights and solutions to help businesses on their path to greater sustainability. We will explore how firms can effectively measure, analyse, transform and scale their sustainability initiatives. How can sufficient investment be unlocked? How can good data be generated? What incentives are needed to stimulate innovation?

Tony Blair
Executive chairman, Tony Blair Institute for Global Change and former Prime Minister, Great Britain and Northern Ireland
Tony Blair served as Prime Minister of Great Britain and Northern Ireland from 1997 to 2007 – the only Labour leader in the party’s 100-year history to win three consecutive elections.
During his time in Downing Street Tony Blair implemented a major domestic reform agenda. Through record investment and reform, the UK’s education and healthcare sectors were transformed. The New Labour Government led by Tony implemented the largest hospital and school building since the creation of the UK’s welfare state.
Overall crime was reduced by a third, and the first ever national minimum wage was introduced. There was also transformational progress on human rights and equality and all of this took place during a period of record economic growth and levels of employment.
As Prime Minister, Tony Blair was also a central figure on the global stage. He helped bring peace to Northern Ireland, securing the historic Good Friday Agreement in 1998. He was a passionate advocate of an interventionist foreign policy. Tony created the Department for International Development, tripled the UK’s foreign aid to Africa, and introduced landmark legislation to tackle climate change.
Since leaving office Tony Blair has spent most of his time working on three areas: supporting governments to deliver effectively for their people, working for peace in the Middle East, and countering extremism. He established the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change to work on some of the most difficult challenges in the world today, believing that real leadership has never been more necessary or more difficult.
Currently, teams from Mr. Blair’s Institute are directly supporting leaders across the globe in their fight against Covid-19, delivering analysis and advice to help countries mitigate the economic impact, to harness the power of technology and to better position themselves for the rebuilding to come. Find out more about the recent work of his Institute here.

Actionable insights, practical solutions
Limiting global warming to 1.5°C will require unparalleled transformations to businesses, industries and supply chains. Investors and citizens demand action. Firms are responding: more and more are signing on to bold targets grounded in climate science. But while sustainability is far from languishing on the corporate periphery, far more effort is needed―and fast.
Over four days, The Economist’s sixth annual Sustainability Week will provide actionable insights and solutions to help businesses on their path to greater sustainability. We will explore how firms can effectively measure, analyse, transform and scale their sustainability initiatives. How can sufficient investment be unlocked? How can good data be generated? What incentives are needed to stimulate innovation?

Tony Blair
Executive chairman, Tony Blair Institute for Global Change and former Prime Minister, Great Britain and Northern Ireland
Tony Blair served as Prime Minister of Great Britain and Northern Ireland from 1997 to 2007 – the only Labour leader in the party’s 100-year history to win three consecutive elections.
During his time in Downing Street Tony Blair implemented a major domestic reform agenda. Through record investment and reform, the UK’s education and healthcare sectors were transformed. The New Labour Government led by Tony implemented the largest hospital and school building since the creation of the UK’s welfare state.
Overall crime was reduced by a third, and the first ever national minimum wage was introduced. There was also transformational progress on human rights and equality and all of this took place during a period of record economic growth and levels of employment.
As Prime Minister, Tony Blair was also a central figure on the global stage. He helped bring peace to Northern Ireland, securing the historic Good Friday Agreement in 1998. He was a passionate advocate of an interventionist foreign policy. Tony created the Department for International Development, tripled the UK’s foreign aid to Africa, and introduced landmark legislation to tackle climate change.
Since leaving office Tony Blair has spent most of his time working on three areas: supporting governments to deliver effectively for their people, working for peace in the Middle East, and countering extremism. He established the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change to work on some of the most difficult challenges in the world today, believing that real leadership has never been more necessary or more difficult.
Currently, teams from Mr. Blair’s Institute are directly supporting leaders across the globe in their fight against Covid-19, delivering analysis and advice to help countries mitigate the economic impact, to harness the power of technology and to better position themselves for the rebuilding to come. Find out more about the recent work of his Institute here.

pepsico,https://www.pepsico.com/sustainability/overview ,"HELPING TO BUILD A MORE SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEM
Sustainability Overview
Helping to Build a More Sustainable Food System
Over the years, the global food system has brought nutrition, economic opportunity, convenience, and enjoyment. Today, however, the global impacts of climate change, soil erosion, water scarcity, and population growth bring challenges that threaten its ability to meet our needs. The food system is in urgent need of transformation.
Our Opportunity to Lead Positive Change
At PepsiCo, we believe that there is an opportunity to change how the world produces, distributes, consumes, and disposes of foods and beverages in order to tackle the shared challenges we face.
We aim to use our scale, reach, and expertise to help build a more sustainable food system; one that can meet human needs for nutrition and enjoyment, and continue to drive economic and social development, without exceeding the natural boundaries of the planet.
As well as being good for our business, working to realize this purpose is also the right thing to do. Where our food system may be operating in an unsustainable way, it can create supply chain, operational, and financial risks for our company. By contrast, addressing risks within our value chain and the wider food system effectively can create new opportunities for competitive advantage and future market growth, while also supporting the communities in which we operate.

Our Focus Areas
PepsiCo’s sustainability agenda focuses on six overlapping priorities within our food system. Our priorities meet three important criteria: They relate to the most pressing sustainability challenges, risks, and opportunities facing PepsiCo and our food system; they matter most to PepsiCo's key external stakeholders; and they offer the opportunity for PepsiCo to make a positive difference at a systemic level, within and beyond our own value chain.
Our Sustainability Journey
In 2006, PepsiCo started on a journey to transform the way we do business so that we can deliver strong financial returns in a way that is responsive to the needs of the world around us. Our fundamental belief is that the success of our company is inextricably linked to the sustainability of the world around us, and each year we continue to make valuable progress.

One of the longest ongoing debates in the world of economic trade, politics, and human growth involves the evolution of sustainable development.
What is this sustainable development? Can it create jobs? Reduce the poverty line? Or will a company go bankrupt once sustainable policies are enforced? The economy and its monetary flow are consistently used as the lead priority to influence the current cultural and economic decisions made by some big American corporate brands and politics.
While other international institutions, such as the EU, believe moderation and regulation of resources based on scientific backings would be the true directive in a healthy economy. One of the main questions that arise in sustainability issues is the basis of profit versus environment. On a government, corporate, and individual level, sustainability ideally has the interests of all.
It especially affects those around the world and those in need. Sustainability can be seen making a breakthrough in combining profit with sustainability values using the five elements of Water, Energy, Waste, Ecology, and Food. The elements include micro farming, solar energy expansion, air to water innovations, the universal works of recycling, and sustainable fish farming.
Sustainable development is a broad terminology that is inclusive to all forms of growth in maintaining needs for present generations without compromising future generations to come, as defined by the UN. It is also one of the focal points in the subject of environmental conservation and regulation. It can also be defined as the study and maintenance of ecological balances in terms of resources and how natural systems function.
Flag of the United Nations
The term dates back to the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) of 1992 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, also known as the Earth Summit. Participation of 117 heads of state and representatives of 178 nations made the Earth Summit the largest gathering of world leaders up to the year 1992. The Earth Summit was the first international attempt to conjure solutions and treaties based on sustainable development for economic development and environmental protection.
The environmental issues were separated into two categories: protection of environmental media and regulations of particular activities and products. Examples of environmental media would include halting deforestation, protecting land resources and protecting freshwater resources.
Examples of activities and products in need of regulation include toxic chemicals, hazardous wastes, biotechnology, and agricultural practices. Sustainable development was the solution originally created at the Brundtland Commission in the 1987 Our Common Future, which was used as the basis of the Earth Summit.
In 2005, the World Summit on Social Development identified the three cores areas of sustainable development, called The Three Pillars of Sustainability. The pillars are economic development, environmental development, and social development, also informally known as profit, planet, and people. These three cores vary in basis, but, are similar in collective goal and place each other into consideration.
In the past, sustainability had been directed on purely environmental concerns that needed to be acknowledged and accounted for. Now, with the involvement of social, economic and environmental interests, it is easier to view sustainability in the grander scheme of stabilizing our planet as a whole.
Environmental pillar: It was previously known as the primary reason for sustainability. It continues to play a major role and has been further integrated into the corporate environment.
Economic pillar: The economic pillar has the most innovative potential to combine sustainable practices, technology, and money-making tools.
Social pillar: The social pillar is focused on health, wellness, and education of the people with the quality of life as one of the major priorities.
EPA | Sustainability Primer
With all the money saved by being sustainable, individuals are able to spend on other areas. For example, they could go on trips, renovate their home, pay back debt, or make stock investments in other more innovative areas.
Technology is advancing society more rapidly than ever, while many other parts of the world are unable to adapt to the momentum of change. There are yet many economies around the world that struggle to increase their GDP and provide for impoverished sectors of their societies.
According to World Bank, 10 % of the World’s population makes less than $1.90 in U.S. dollars compared to the 1990 statistic of nearly 36%; however, the 10% still accounts for nearly 736 million people who are living under extreme poverty.
Half the world’s population, 3.4 billion, still struggles to meet basic needs. The lower-middle income countries live on less than $3.20 a day and the upper-middle income countries live on less than $5.50 a day. The situation is similar, but worse, of the environment, where other areas of our society excel while our environment breaks down and struggles under pressure.
Weather.com has sourced that 9 million tons of plastic get dumped into our oceans every year, sea levels have tripled in the rate of rising within the last decade, and extreme weather causes high damage and costs. World forests, as reported by Food and Agriculture Organization of UN, have declined from 31.6 % to 30.6%. The numbers have slowed in the recent past years which show improvement in sustainability initiatives.
But, of course, economic growth can prosper without maintaining the environment or building up the lower class. Is that how it really works? How does one work in a group project? They complete the responsibility they are given. What if the fellow colleagues are unable to provide their documentation because one is unmotivated, the other does not have computer accessibility, or someone “borrows” their pens without returning them to the colleague.
The project as a whole lacks. The project is a C. Teamwork provides communication, helping one another, and pushing each other to succeed. The success of all is the success of one. When one worker focuses on themselves and loses the others, the value of the project is downgraded in doing so. Each name would be associated with one project. In reality, society does not work as a one man job.

A lack in any part of the world can cause major economic issues in other parts of the planet. If Ebola breaks out in a country with poor healthcare, it could kill millions very quickly; thus, the workforce would be down, the healthcare costs would go up, and psychological stress prevents citizens from going outside. If our agriculture and the oceans are not maintained, we will lose major food sources, tourism, and income for countries around the world.
Another major issue confronted by sustainability are the lack of resources to maintain current 21st century lifestyles. At the rate of mass manufacturing and production, the Earth is limited in what it contains. The report “Frontiers of Material Research: A Decadal Survey”, commissioned by National Science Foundation (NSF) and Department of Energy, critiques the lack of available resources that are needed for the growing generation of competition and economic growth.
Areas of particular critical issues include, but are not exclusive to, are computer science and engineering, quantum information science, and digital manufacturing. The reports show strong support for Earth’s environmental sustainability as a gateway for major impact to the future of material science.
The research would work towards sustainable manufacturing, appropriate raw material choice, energy-efficient methods, and recyclability. They wish to combine institutions of government, industry and academia for the interdisciplinary research and growth of material science.

Sustainability has been crossing boundaries in all areas of society. With these five basic elements of food, energy, water, waste, and ecology, companies and organizations around the world are taking major steps in creating a society that functions and prospers with sustainability.
Micro farming, also known as urban farming, is farming on residential or commercial property that is around less than five acres. Micro farming is being encouraged by sustainability groups in order to reduce carbon emissions, increase local economic growth, increase public health, and improve food security.
It can be implemented in many kinds of environments from metro city lots to suburban backyards, and they can produce a variety of crops from nuts to vegetables or fruits.
SuperScholar.org | Micro-Farming Tips
Several studies show that organic, micro farming is a low pesticide- high crop yield process, which deems more effective in quantity of per seed, than the genetically engineered(GE), mass manufactured produce. There are other studies that contradict these studies, in support of pro-pesticide agriculture. However, it is highly encouraged in a sustainable perception to use the minimal herbicide and pesticide direction, considering major crops in the United States, such as corn and soy, are becoming herbicide resistant at a 85 % to 93 % level.
Pesticides are potentially toxic and can have acute and chronic health effects. The toxicity ranges from the type of pesticide being used. They can range from affecting the nervous system, hormones, skin, and can even be carcinogenic. Ideally, they are supposed to be absorbed by the vegetation; however, due to irrigation, waterfall, and herbicide resistance increasing, pesticides leak into groundwater and surface water.
Fleet Farming is an non-profit program in Orlando, Florida that install farmlettes, Edible Landscapes, and Fleet Education throughout the Orlando area. It is affiliated with IDEAS For Us and accredited by the United Nations. Multiple studies report an average American meal travels 1500 miles to reach the dinner table. There are 40 millions acres of lawn space maintained by 800 million gallons of gasoline from lawn mowers and they use 30 to 60% of the average cities’ freshwater.
Fleet Farming was created to combine lawn space with agricultural production, reduce carbon emissions, and improve the convenience of healthy, economic food consumption. Fleet Farmlettes is a program that creates model urban farms for communities to learn about sustainable food growth and local farmers markets. It supports local vendors, SNAP Certified Farmer’s Markets, and the Farmlette Hosts. Edible Landscapes is a service that installs and maintains low-maintenance growing systems such as raised garden bed and food forests.

Low income families in California have the opportunity to participate in California’s Solar Initiative (CSI) that provides a Single-family Affordable Solar Homes (SASH) Program and Multi-family Affordable Solar Homes (MASH) Program. SASH, more specifically, is a program this is administered by Grid Alternatives and funded through a ratepayer-funded program from the California Public Utilities Commission.
The goal of SASH is to offer qualified low-income homes of %80 or below the areas median household income fixed, up-front capacity-based rebates and incentives for solar power systems.
The portable solar power system has been touted as the long run’s vitality because it gets to be more affordable. These are some of the foremost easily-recognizable illustrations of economic development. Solar is driving within the world as the fastest growing renewable vitality source.
One incentive offers $3 per watt. SASH aims to decrease electricity usage, reduce energy bills, decrease solar energy expenses with incentives, and provide job training and employment in energy efficiency.
The program was enacted by CA Assembly Bill 2723 in 2009, which directed a minimum of 10% of California Solar Initiative funds(2.2 billion) to be set aside for programs assisting low-income households in Investor Owned Utility (IOU) service territories.
The Assembly Bill 217 (Bradford, 2013) extended the SASH and MASH programs by adding $108 million for funding. Then, in January 2015, the CPUC made the regulatory decision to reauthorize the program. Currently, the program is set to run until 2021 until further notice.
Energysage.com | 2019 Solar Panels Savings Estimate
According to energysage.com, Americans spend an average of over $1,335 a year on electricity, where electricity costs have increased an average of 2.2% in the past decade. Solar panels lock energy costs at a constant rate. Also, if enough energy is pulled from the solar panels, credit is provided for energy used at night while the solar panels are not performing, and can even be carried over to next month, from the gridded energy company.
Since launching SASH, CSI has issued a progress report from July 2018 of the program’s progress in three of California’s serviced territories. There have been around 7,703 PV systems installed and connected, $119 million given in incentive, and 25 MW represented in solar capacity. 7,802 home-owners have been referred to the Energy Savings Assistance (ESA) program.

From the dry heat in Arizona to the humid temperatures in South Florida, the technology that transforms air into water has been spreading to the hottest areas in the United States. The technology has even gone overseas into the likes of Thailand, Dubai, Israel, and South Africa. The work has been endorsed by well-known tech entrepreneurs, such as Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, and other investors around the world.
Companies such as Zero Mass Water, Generation Water, Atmospheric Water Solutions, Smart Oasis, and Water-gen have been growing and building around the world to combat the world’s water crisis. 2.5% of the world’s water is freshwater, where an even smaller percentage is what humans can actually consume. According to World Health Organization (WHO) from 2015, 29% of the world’s population (2.1 billion people) does not have immediate access to clean water. In 2025, half the world’s population is not expected to have sufficient clean water access. Technology like this could reduce plastic in water pollution and increase accessibility to areas around the world.
Variations of this technology has been built around the world. Some require access to electricity while others are powered by solar panels. Zero Mass Water is a company based in Phoenix, Arizona that uses twin solar panels installed on rooftops. The technology captures air with a fan and hygroscopic absorbing, which filters dust and pollutants.
Then, minerals are added to provide water similar to spring water. Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, and other investors have specifically financed Zero Mass Water with $1 billion to the business. It costs $2,000 for each panel (typically 2 panels) to install and provides an output of 2 to 5 liters of water a day. The product has been installed in 18 different countries, such as orphanages in Lebanon to mansions in California. It is especially working with South Africa and Australia.
Recycling is one of the most cost effective and diversive ways to attain products or save money. It is the practice of reusing waste or older items that would normally be discarded. Different kinds of recycling include upcycling, downcycling, E-cycling, or precycling. When recycling, the seller uses a platform such a website, mobile app, recycling center, clothing store, pawn shop, furniture store, or even a garage sale to to sell an old item at a price cheaper than its original value.
This way, the buyer is able to purchase the desired product at an affordable cost. Some people choose to donate their used items instead of asking for money in return. Virtually anything can be reused. Compost from food and feces could be used for gardens. Clothing, shoes, cars, cell phones, blankets, toys, teeth, nails…
Websites: Ebay and Amazon are one of the most popular and well-known websites for consumer-to-consumer or business-to-consumer networks and sell almost everything. For supporters of local business, Etsy is a website that sells hand-crafted and unique items made by consumers for consumers.
Applications: Applications such as Letgo and OfferUp are consumer-to-consumer platforms that allow you to buy and pick in convenient locations such as a seller in your own neighborhood. Mercari is an application that is shipping only and provides extra protection to the buyer of the product.
Clothes: There are multiple clothing stores that offer discounts on purchases for donating clothes such as Levi’s, H & M, Madewell, and Kiehls. Stores such as Plato’s Closet offers to buy used current clothes for cheap prices for affordable prices. Websites such as ThredUP and Poshmark give you an online platform to sell used, name-brand clothes at affordable prices.
Glass Bottles, Aluminum Cans, Paper/Cardboard: There are many centers that buy recyclables for five to ten cents a piece.
Kamikatsu, Japan: In 2003, the small town of Kamikatsu, Japan saw the damages that greenhouse gases and toxins were causing their food supply from the waste incinerators. So they embarked on a strict zero-waste system that has recycled, reused, or composted around 80 % of their waste, with the rest going to landfills. Residents are very involved in the process, organizing their trash into 34 categories. The program has saved the village a third of its former costs from waste incineration.
Neustadt an der Weinstrasse, Germany: After 30 years of refining the waste management system, the town Neustadt an der Weinstrasse, recycles 70 % of it garbage. With a population of approximately 50,000 people, the town uses financial incentive and education to influence their society. Recycled waste is free of charge, while non-recyclable waste has a charge related to varying sizes of the bins. A 60 litre bin is 6.60 euros in collection fees. A 240 litre bin ranges from 24 euros to 48 euros depending on pick up date. The recycling is sorted into paper/cardboards, glass, and plastics/foils/cans/styrofoam.
The rest, such as batteries, toys, timber, tin, etc., are transported to the recycling depot. Organizing waste provides savings from as much as 270 euros to 17 euros. Germany, in general, has stopped using landfills since 2005.

Fish Farming is the process of growing fish in a net or confined space. It has been growing in popularity as an alternative to fishing in the ocean compared to overfishing, which has been an increasing issue around the world. 80 % of wild fish have been overfished in order to meet population’s demand. The effects of overfishing in the ocean have been significant. Fish farming is also known as a controversial alternative because of its multiple flaws. Popularly farmed fish, such as Salmon, tuna, and cod, are carnivores that consume other fish. Fish farmers have to actually continue fishing in the oceans in order to provide for their own fish farms.
Alternatives to the extra fishing include feeding the fish pellets. These fish pellets are large carbohydrates that fishes’ bodies are not adjusted to eating. The health benefits of consuming fish decreases with fish farms because the fish do not consume their typical diet. Diseases are also more likely to spread in these farms, thus, these farms are filled with antibiotics and chemicals. Farmed fish can also contaminate water quality with their waste and the fish can escape into foreign waters. Does society need to choose between overfishing and fish farms?
Research led by Jacob Allgeier and Craig Layman, a doctoral student and associate professor respectively, was done from the University of Georgia. Taking place in the Bahamas, it shows the importance of fishing retrospect to what they provide in the underwater ecosystems. Fish are a source of protein for larger predators and other fish to consume. When fish excrete waste (nitrgen and phosphorous), seagrass and algae are fertilized and they are consumed as primary food sources for creatures of the tropical coastal ecosystems.
These ecosystems need the right proportions of phosphorus and nitrogen for algae and seagrass to thrive and expand. The study by UG had observed how fishes and reefs of different sizes affected the expansion of the tropical ecosystems. The results showed that fish at larger reefs produced more nutrients from waste excretion, where the nutrients were in such excess, it spread around 3 meters from the larger reefs. This caused the algae and seagrass to spread. Overfishing is contributing to the imbalance in fish species, which causes the nutrient excretion proportion to destabilize the ecosystems’ primary food source. The lack of fish may as well be destroying a major portion of the ocean’s ability to flourish in its current state.
Current fishing techniques have been improving in order to follow sustainability guidelines and to make fish farming a progressive, profitable alternative. Fix.com sources the older and newer fish farming techniques. One system, called the recirculating system, is a closed, inland process that has little impact on the outside bodies of water. The area needed for this system is smaller than a regular fish farm since the growth rate of fish is high. Waste is treated and used as high-quality fertilizer and the wastewater is filtered and reused. Another fish farming system, 3D farming, uses entire water columns and improves the surrounding ecosystem by acting as a natural filter that removes pollutants. This system farms kelp, scallops, muscles, and oysters, and reduces maintenance for water treatment and pesticides.
The natural seaweed acts as food rich with nutrients. Open pen fish farming still has flaws but has come a long way from its original design. Vaccines are being used on fishes to reduce the excess of antibiotics and fish are fed plant-based fish meal. The pens are also moved around in different areas of the body of water to allow the environment to heal. Scientists and fish farmers are also working on revitalizing a herbivore diet for the fish to flourish. Recently, the fish farming industry has been pushing for indoor farming (recirculated system) to reduce water pollution and threatening the wild fish in lcaotions such as Norway.

sciencedirect,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652613008032 ,"Eco-innovations, eco-efficiency and corporate social responsibility practices define much of the current industrial sustainability agenda. While important, they are insufficient in themselves to deliver the holistic changes necessary to achieve long-term social and environmental sustainability. How can we encourage corporate innovation that significantly changes the way companies operate to ensure greater sustainability?
Sustainable business models (SBM) incorporate a triple bottom line approach and consider a wide range of stakeholder interests, including environment and society. They are important in driving and implementing corporate innovation for sustainability, can help embed sustainability into business purpose and processes, and serve as a key driver of competitive advantage.
Many innovative approaches may contribute to delivering sustainability through business models, but have not been collated under a unifying theme of business model innovation. The literature and business practice review has identified a wide range of examples of mechanisms and solutions that can contribute to business model innovation for sustainability. The examples were collated and analysed to identify defining patterns and attributes that might facilitate categorisation.
Sustainable business model archetypes are introduced to describe groupings of mechanisms and solutions that may contribute to building up the business model for sustainability. The aim of these archetypes is to develop a common language that can be used to accelerate the development of sustainable business models in research and practice. The archetypes are: Maximise material and energy efficiency; Create value from ‘waste’; Substitute with renewables and natural processes; Deliver functionality rather than ownership; Adopt a stewardship role; Encourage sufficiency; Re-purpose the business for society/environment; and Develop scale-up solutions. .

At HeidelbergCement, lawful and ethical conduct is a core component of our business activities.
Responsible business practices are the cornerstone of our success. For us, acting responsibly means that we achieve our economic performance in accordance with laws and international standards and by socially and ecologically beneficial means. Besides complying with applicable laws and regulations, we are also committed to global values and standards. In all the countries in which we operate, we comply with and respect the applicable laws and regulations. They form the legal basis for our business activity.
As a globally active company, we are also bound by international values and standards. We are therefore committed to adhering to the core labour standards of the International Labour Organization (ILO), the Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises recommended by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and the United Nations’ Universal Declaration of Human Rights. We expect our employees and business partners worldwide also to observe these central guidelines and recommendations.
Our R&D activities aim to generate added value for customers and the company through innovative products. We also minimize energy usage and our CO2 emissions by means of process improvements and new formulations.
Our close proximity to the market enables us to provide our customers with extensive advice and develop our products in close consultation with them. The responsible departments and employees are directly incorporated into the organisation of the respective national subsidiaries and develop cements, aggregates, and concretes that are optimally adapted to local needs.
Local responsibility is at the heart of HeidelbergCement's sustainability strategy: Our Sustainability Commitments 2030 apply across the Group at more than 3,000 locations in over 50 countries.
HeidelbergCement’s sustainability strategy focuses on climate protection, environmental responsibility, and ensuring the permanent availability of resources. This has given rise to our objective of operating sustainable production processes at all of our operational sites worldwide.
We also expect our suppliers to be aware of our standards: that is why a Code of Conduct forms the basis of all of our partnerships, and our contractors have to commit themselves to upholding this code.
Due to the high temperatures needed to burn limestone, the production of cement consumes a lot of energy and thus causes combustion-related CO2 emissions. This is why climate protection is a fundamental part of our environmental policy.
Climate protection is a core element of HeidelbergCement’s environmental policy.
The conservation of natural resources is part of our sustainable business strategy.
Our sites are operated in accordance with relevant international, national and local environmental legislation.
Qualified and motivated employees are an important prerequisite for the success of HeidelbergCement. Identifying our employees’ talents and developing them is therefore at the core of the Group-wide personnel policy. We attach particular importance to occupational safety and the protection of our employees’ health.
For us, a good personnel policy means having due and proper regard for our employees with their range of talents and wealth of experience. And it therefore means creating the right conditions to allow them to do their job with efficiency and dedication. This includes fair remuneration and tailor-made qualification opportunities in addition to a non-discriminatory working environment and flexible conditions that allow them to reconcile professional and family demands.
Another area of particular importance to us as a manufacturing company is occupational safety and the protection of our employees’ health. We are proud of the international nature of the workforce at our headquarters and in our technical centers in Heidelberg and Leimen, which is made up of local managers and employees from 52 countries. Our staff form the foundation of the worldwide success of HeidelbergCement.
Qualified, motivated employees are a key prerequisite for the long-term success of our company.
Occupational health and safety has top priority at HeidelbergCement.
As a global Group with strong regional business operations, we act according to the principle “think global – act local”.
We have production sites almost everywhere around the globe. Through our entrepreneurial activities, we create added value for the communities in which we operate. We are also involved in community projects at our sites.
Good cooperative relationships with the communities in the areas where we are active are indispensable for our business operations and one of the keys to our business success. In these areas, we establish business contacts, capitalise on local know-how, and maintain a dialogue with our neighbours. By making this voluntary commitment to society, we strengthen the exchange of ideas and achieve long-term socio-economical added value for local communities. .

Sustainable business in Sweden
Extensive environmental protection, active measures to respect human rights and improve work environments, and fighting corruption. Many of today’s Swedish companies are at the forefront in integrating a sustainable approach to business in their strategies and daily management.
Leading by example
The term sustainable business is used to describe the work companies do that has a positive impact on society, the environment or the economy. Efforts to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide, promotion of equal career opportunities, and involvement with local communities are examples of sustainable business initiatives.
Swedish companies have a long history of active work in the field and is widely viewed as a pioneer. In the latest the RobecoSAM Country Sustainability Ranking (2019), Sweden was ranked first of 65 countries, based on environmental, social and governance (ESG) indicators.
Environment
The environmental aspects of sustainable business are extremely broad, including areas such as paper recycling, the sustainable use of resources, minimising environmental footprints and reducing water consumption.
Cleantech – a term used to describe products or services that improve operational performance, productivity or efficiency while reducing costs, inputs, energy consumption, waste or pollution – is another important part of sustainable business. Internationally, Sweden continues to fare well in energy and environmental technology, coming third in the Global Cleantech Innovation Index 2017, after Denmark and Finland.
Although Sweden generally fares well in international comparisons of gender equality, its construction industry remains a highly male-dominated sector.

Gender equality
Gender equality is an important aspect of the way companies work with sustainable business. Companies can promote equality by making it possible for parents to combine work and family, encouraging shared participation in childcare, and giving women and men equal opportunities to rise to leadership positions.
The World Economic Forum’s Global Gender Gap Report assesses and compares national gender gaps based on economic, political, education and health criteria. In the 2021 report, Sweden was ranked fifth of 156 assessed countries, surpassed only by Iceland, Finland, Norway and New Zealand.
Anti-corruption
Corruption has been identified by the World Bank as one of the greatest threats to growth. Sweden ranked fourth on Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index 2020, together with Finland, Singapore and Switzerland. The index ranked 180 countries and territories by their perceived levels of public sector corruption.
Since 2012, Sweden’s legislation has categorised the giving or acceptance of bribes as serious crimes. The legislation was largely a result of Sweden adopting anti-corruption conventions in collaboration with the EU, European Council, UN and OECD. Since 1997, the OECD has had a convention prohibiting the bribery of overseas public servants in international business relationships.
IKEA’s sustainability programme goes beyond taking responsibility for manufacturing plants; it also includes transportation, customer choices and parking for electric cars.

Promoting sustainable initiatives
By placing demands on its own enterprises and promoting sustainable initiatives in general, the Swedish Government aims to inspire all companies to increase their sustainability efforts.
The Swedish Government owns 46 companies of various sizes, two of which are listed companies. In 2007, Sweden became the first country to demand sustainability reports from state-owned enterprises. The reports have to comply with guidelines from the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI).
In 2012, Sweden took another important step by asking state-owned companies to set several sustainability goals, and to report on them in 2014. The targets are to be set by the company boards, with focus on diversity, environment issues, human rights, working conditions, anti-corruption measures, business ethics and gender equality. The targets must also be measurable, specific and relevant to the companies’ operations.
Human rights – a priority
The Swedish Government expects all Swedish companies, private or state-owned, to respect human rights in all their operations. It encourages the private sector to follow the OECD’s guidelines for multinational companies, to apply the ten principles of the UN Global Compact and follow the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.
In the end, however, sustainable business practice should be driven and owned by the private sector, with each company deciding if and how it will work with sustainability.
Striving to lead by example, the Government has a unit within the Ministry for Foreign Affairs focusing on issues related to sustainable trade and business, and also has an Ambassador for Sustainable Business (see box).
Environmental initiatives
Strict environmental legislation combined with high levels of environmental awareness and knowledge have led Swedish companies to be environmentally innovative and efficient in their operations. Low-impact production techniques, in particular within industrial production, are now often exported to other countries.
Sweden also plays a prominent role in cleantech sectors such as non-fossil fuels and water quality, with several companies as leaders in their fields. SEKAB, for example, is a major European supplier of ethanol and ethanol derivatives, used for fuels and low-environmental-impact chemicals, while water-technology company Xylem has operations in more than 150 countries.
Four Swedish companies striving to set examples
Atlas Copco
Atlas Copco is a leading supplier of industrial equipment such as compressors and assembly systems. Since it has operations and production facilities in countries where there is a high risk of human rights violations, Atlas Copco follows a human rights strategy. In line with this strategy the company not only conducts regular corporate assessments, but also helps business partners and customers improve human rights. www.atlascopco.com
Systembolaget
In 2012, state-owned alcohol monopoly Systembolaget introduced a code of conduct – based on the declaration of human rights made by the UN and other international bodies – for its wholesale purchases of alcoholic drinks, in collaboration with the alcohol monopolies of Norway, Finland, Iceland and the Faroe Islands. The code requires responsible treatment in terms of human rights, working conditions, anti-corruption measures, and environmental issues in both the companies’ own operations and their supply chains. www.systembolaget.se
H&M
Clothing company H&M, with nearly 5,000 stores around the world, has an eco-clothing line called Conscious Collection. H&M works actively with its suppliers to promote labour rights and reduce environmental impacts. Around 700 suppliers manufacture H&M products, many of them in countries where issues such as child labour and workplace safety can pose problems. H&M has an audit team of 70 people monitoring suppliers’ compliance with the H&M code of conduct. www.hm.com
IKEA
Furniture retailer IKEA plans to use only renewable and recycled materials in their products by 2030. The company’s extensive sustainabaility strategy can be read here.

github,https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_the-sustainable-business-case-book/s10-01-green-marketing-strategy-and-t.html ,"Kermit the frog may have had it right—“It’s not easy being green.” There is a lot to consider when creating a sustainable marketing strategy. It is not simply adding “green” to your brand platform or announcing that you support a worthy cause. To be most successful, a commitment to sustainability should be part of the company’s overall vision and an integral part of the company’s values and fundamental beliefs. For example, Seventh Generation, a Vermont-based company that makes personal and household cleaning products, adheres to a model of deeper business purpose (see Chapter 8 ""Case: Marketing Sustainability: Seventh Generation Creating a Green Household Consumer Product""). The company’s founder, Jeffrey Hollender, had a vision to create and nurture a company with sustainability at the core. Everything that the company does focuses on the triple bottom line of people, planet, and profit for the greater good. From their products—which are made using only natural, recycled, or renewable materials—to their philanthropic efforts that seek to help create a sustainable community, Seventh Generation employs a well-integrated sustainability vision and strategy.
A strong sustainability strategy includes understanding how the company impacts the people and environment in which it operates and consciously applies sustainable practices throughout every element of its business. Companies such as Timberland (see Chapter 11 ""Case: Accounting for Sustainability: How Does Timberland Do It and Why?"") and Procter & Gamble have adopted sustainability practices and have set specific and measureable goals—both short and longer term—to reduce their company’s carbon footprint. This includes actively examining the carbon lifecycle of their products—from the raw materials used in manufacturing all the way through to the recycling phase to ensure that they are meeting these goals.
Inherent in this practice is the concept of radical transparency, whereby everything the company does is transparent and visible to the consumer and community at large, which contributes to the credibility of the sustainable brand. Measureable goals contribute to radical transparency as they provide clear and actionable goals to which the company can commit and progress against. For example, Unilever’s sustainable strategy commits to aggressively reducing their environmental impact and enhancing livelihoods by the year 2020. Unilever has made sustainability the cornerstone of their mission with clear, transparent goals against which they will be measured.“Unilever Sustainable Living Plan,” Unilever, http://www.unilever.com/images/UnileverSustainableLivingPlan_tcm13-239379.pdf.
To view Unilever's Sustainable Living Plan, visit http://www.unilever.com/images/UnileverSustainableLivingPlan_tcm13-239379.pdf and go to page seven.
Radical Transparency
Radical transparency involves everything a company does being completely transparent and visible to the consumer and all stakeholders.
A marketing planA written plan, which is well integrated with the company’s vision, containing objectives, strategies, and tactics to be used to meet a company’s marketing goals. The marketing plan is typically done yearly. is derived from the company’s vision and integrates an organization’s overall goals and marketing objectives (what goals they want to achieve) and strategies (how they are going to achieve them) into a cohesive plan, typically on an annual basis. The green marketingMarketing activities aimed at taking advantage of the changing consumer attitudes toward more sustainable principles. Green marketing companies seek to go above and beyond traditional marketing by promoting environmental core values in the hope that consumers will associate these values with their company or brand. plan focuses on the ideal marketing mix to achieve maximum profit potential while adhering to sustainability principles.
The key elements of the marketing plan are as follows:
There are several keys to creating an effective green marketing strategy:
Product Life Cycle
There are basically five stages of the product life cycle, including the development, introduction, growth, maturity, and decline stages. Customers will only be able to purchase products in the latter four stages because the product typically has not yet been placed on the market in the development stage. Some companies, however, like computer software companies, do release a limited number of products during the development phase to help with their beta testing.
The marketing mix, also known as the four Ps of marketing, is the combination of productA tangible good or intangible service that is marketed to a consumer., price, place (distribution), and promotionThe marketing communication tools and tactics that a company uses to promote and market their product, such as advertising, public relations, social media, personal selling, and event marketing, among others.. Marketers develop strategies around these four areas in marketing to enhance branding, sales, and profitability. The marketing mix forms the foundation for creating a sustainable marketing strategy. Sustainability marketing, unlike traditional marketing, needs to adhere well to sustainability principles throughout the marketing mix. This helps to (1) strengthen the brand identity; (2) provide credibility; and (3) ensure honest, truthful communications and radical transparency with stakeholders, one of the cornerstones of good sustainability marketing principles.
A product is a tangible good or an intangible service that is marketed to a consumer. A tangible good is something that can be seen, heard, tasted, felt, or seen. Products such as coffee, milk, biofuel, laundry detergent, and outdoor apparel are all examples of tangible goods.
Intangible products are mostly service based and provided by someone directly in contact with customers, such as mutual fund investment services, health care services, and consulting services. Sometimes the intangible service results in a tangible product, such as a lawyer providing legal advice in filing for a product patent. The intangible product is the lawyer’s services, and the tangible product is the patent itself.
When looking at a sustainable-marketed product, consideration should be made for sourcing of materials, ingredients used, and the manufacturing of the product. This includes using all natural and organic materials, sourcing local and through fair trade suppliers, utilizing environmentally friendly materials, and using lean manufacturing and distribution methods that minimize the company’s carbon footprint. For example, Unilever (the corporate owner of Ben & Jerry’s) has committed that all ingredients in Ben & Jerry’s ice cream be sourced through fair trade suppliers and certified as such by 2013.
Fair Trade
Fair trade is a global trade system that ensures producers get a fair price for their goods. It is the cornerstone of a sustainable economy. Starbucks began purchasing Fair Trade Certified coffee in 2000, helping to grow the market for Fair Trade Certified™ coffee in the United States. Fair Trade Certified™ coffee empowers small-scale farmers organized in cooperatives to invest in their farms and communities, protect the environment, and develop the business skills necessary to compete in the global marketplace.“Responsibly Grown and Fair Trade Coffee,” Starbucks, http://www.starbucks.com/responsibility/sourcing/coffee.
Companies, both large and small, are undertaking sustainability initiatives. The most successful companies in doing this sincerely embrace sustainability principles at its core; set clear and measurable goals; and clearly, transparently, and truthfully communicate with their stakeholders about the ecological and social impacts of their products and services. These companies use the four PsCombination of product, price, place (distribution), and promotion that encompass the marketing mix. to enhance and fulfill their sustainable positioning to be true to the vision throughout their marketing mix.
Seventh Generation is a pioneer in sustainability marketing and a leader in natural household cleaning products. Deriving its name from the Great Law of the Iroquois that states, “In our every deliberation, we must consider the impact of our decisions on the next seven generations,” Seventh Generation has long been practicing sustainability throughout its marketing mix for over twenty years. Their entire product line of household and personal care products—from laundry detergents to baby wipes—are carefully designed and manufactured to minimize their impact on the environment. Using all natural, renewable, and recyclable resources, Seventh Generation is working to “help protect human health and the environment.”“Green Cleaning Products,” Seventh Generation, http://www.seventhgeneration.com. (See Chapter 8 ""Case: Marketing Sustainability: Seventh Generation Creating a Green Household Consumer Product"" for more information on their approach to sustainable marketing.)
Timberland’s Earthkeepers product line is the company’s most visible effort to put their environmental values into their products and market it. Products produced under the Earthkeepers label feature (1) reduced use of harmful chemicals, including no PVC and water-based adhesives; (2) use of recycled materials, including plastic bottles made into linings and laces and recycled rubber sole boots made with up to 30 percent recycled rubber; (3) use of organic materials, including organic cotton; and (4) use of recycled packaging materials, with all boxes made of 100 percent postconsumer recycled packaging cardboard. Timberland has implemented eco-labels to communicate information to consumers about the impacts of their products and has implemented life cycle management to quantify the environmental impacts of the products that it produces. (See Chapter 11 ""Case: Accounting for Sustainability: How Does Timberland Do It and Why?"" for more information.)
Another example is General Electric. The company committed to utilizing clean technologies and reducing their environmental footprint in 2005 with their ecoimagination program. Since then, a hybrid engine train has been put into development, a state-of-the-art wind turbine blade has been manufactured, and a superefficient washing machine and coal-gasification technology have been introduced. General Electric, in particular, is noteworthy for its pledge to double its investments in the research and development of environmentally friendlier technologies. The total budget for research and development went from $700 million in 2004 to $1.5 billion in 2010. General Electric has been consistently named in the top ten of Global 100 Most Sustainable Corporations.“GE and Unilever Step Forth to Write a New Agenda,” New Economy, http://www.theneweconomy.com/business-and-management/sustainability/ge-and-unilever-step-forth-to-write-agenda.
In the garment industry, Earthtec is an emerging sustainability product marketing clothing manufacturer. Using postconsumer recycled polyethylene terephthalate plastics (such as discarded water bottles), Earthtec converts landfill-bound bottles into high-performance fabrics and clothing. The company is dedicated to using recycled or renewable materials in every single article of clothing they make. Beyond their product line focused on sustainability, the company has incorporated a streamlined manufacturing model that is designed to minimize their carbon footprint.“Earthtec—Clothing with a Conscience,” Earthtec, http://www.earthtec.com/our_story/conscience.
An example of sustainable intangibles is the services provided by the mutual fund company Pax World. Pax World is a recognized leader in the field of sustainable investing—the full integration of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors into investment analysis and decision making—in its mutual fund offerings.“About Pax World,” Pax World, http://www.paxworld.com/about. Pax World provides the intangible service of investment advice with a strong sustainability conscience. (See Chapter 12 ""Case: Sustainable Investing: Pax World Helping Investors Change the World"" for a more comprehensive discussion of sustainable investing.)
A consumer target marketA defined set of consumers, who are particularly interested in a product or market, would have access to it, and are able to purchase it. Often referred to as a target audience. (often referred to as a target audience) is a defined set of consumers who are particularly interested in a product or market, would have access to it, and are able to purchase it. Market segmentationTargeting audiences into homogenous groups according to demographics, psychographics, or behavioral or geographical characteristics. divides these audiences into homogenous groups of customers, each of them reacting differently to promotion, communication, pricing, and other variables of the marketing mix. Market segments should be formed in a way that differences between consumers within each segment are as small as possible. This is especially helpful to optimize marketing budgets, targeting dollars to those most interested in your product to allow a more effective and efficient marketing plan.
Segmentation can be further defined using demographic, geographic, psychographic, and behavioral segmentation. Demographic segmentation divides the market into groups based on variables, such as age, marital status, household income levels, education, children in household, and occupation. Geographic segmentation divides a market by location and includes such variables as population density (urban, suburban, and rural areas) and climate. Psychographic segmentation classifies consumers based on individual lifestyles, attitudes, and beliefs. Behavioral segmentation divides consumers by such variables as attitude toward the product, user status, or user rate.
Within the green market segment, it is important to understand which consumers to target. Once strictly limited to “tree huggers,” the market is growing. According to a 2011 study by OgilvyEarth titled “Mainstream Green,” consumers can be subdivided and segmented behaviorally and psychographically by their level of “green intensity.” Hardcore green consumers who only purchase sustainable products are called “super greens” and represent about 16 percent of the market. On the other extreme are “green rejecters,” those not looking for or interested in green products, which represent 18 percent of the market. Most of America (66 percent) is in the green middle ground—not hardcore green but not completely unaware or unappreciative of issues surrounding sustainability.Graceann Bennett and Freya Williams, Mainstream Green, 2011, http://assets.ogilvy.com/truffles_email/ogilvyearth/Mainstream_Green.pdf.

Companies who market to green consumers look at those on the spectrum as well as determine which consumers will provide the greatest volume potential. But with so many consumers firmly entrenched in the middle green, there exists opportunities to create products with mass appeal.
For consumer packaged goodsA type of good that is consumed every day by the average consumer. The goods that compose this category are ones that are typically replaced frequently, compared to those that are usable for extended periods of time. purchases, women are typically the primary target audience as they still do the bulk of today’s household shopping. Seventh Generation, a sustainable personal care and household cleaning products manufacturer, targets the middle green as well as new moms, whom they find to be especially interested in making the world a better place for their newborns.Romy Ribitzky, “Seventh Generation Embarks on First Ever National Ad Campaign,” Portfolio.com, February 11, 2010, http://www.portfolio.com/industry-news/advertising-marketing/2010/02/11/seventh-generation-embarks-on-first-ever-national-ad-campaign.

Consumer Packaged Goods
Consumer packaged goods are a type of good that is consumed every day by the average consumer. The goods that compose this category are ones that need to be replaced frequently, compared to those that are usable for extended periods of time. Examples are laundry detergent, food, shampoo, soap, and beverages.
Other companies target the super green. Super green consumers may undertake costly actions in order to signal themselves as such; this has been called conspicuous conservation.Much of this paragraph is drawn from Steven Sexton and Alison Sexton, “Conspicuous Conservation: The Prius Effect and Willingness to Pay for Environmental Bona Fides” (unpublished manuscript, April 2011). Car ownership decisions are one of the most visible consumption decisions households make. Since the introduction of the Toyota Prius in the United States in 2001, a growing number of vehicle models have been introduced with features that reduce environmental impacts. The Prius was the only model that provided a unique exterior shape and a design that stood out and announced that it was different than standard vehicles. The Prius has emerged as the clear leader among twenty-four different hybrid models available in the United States, with 48 percent of the 290,271 hybrid cars sold in the United States in 2009. Prius’s success is particularly pronounced in communities with high percentages of super greens, such as Berkeley (California), Boulder (Colorado), and Portland (Oregon), who want to make public their environmental practices and beliefs. The Prius with its unique product design has successfully provided the vehicle for owner’s to signal their affinity for the environment allowing super greens to make a conspicuous statement about their conservation efforts.
Packaging plays a critical role in the product’s sustainability. Consumers have increasingly been made aware of environmental packaging choices and are changing their behavior as a result. A leading example of this is with water bottles. Many consumers have made the switch from purchasing single-use plastic water bottles to using refillable water containers. In 2008, 2.5 million tons of plastic bottles and jars were thrown away.“Use-and-Toss Bottle Facts,” Reuseit.com, http://www.reuseit.com/learn-more/top-facts/plastic-bottle-facts. The extremely slow decomposition rate of plastic bottles leaves them to sit in landfills or litter oceans for years. As a result of increased consumer awareness and consumer demand, sales of reusable water bottles from environmentally friendly producers such as Sigg and Kleen Kanteen have come onto the market. Consumers still want clean, filtered water, and companies, such as Brita and PŪR, makers of water filters, have seen a 22.2 percent and 15.2 percent increase in sales during 2009, respectively.GreenerDesign staff, “Green Product Trends: More Launches, More Sales,” GreenBiz.com, April 23, 2009, http://www.greenbiz.com/news/2009/04/23/green-product-trends-more-launches-more-sales.
Another strong consumer packaging trend is the use of reusable shopping bags at grocery stores. Americans use one hundred billion plastic shopping bags every year and over five hundred billion are consumed globally. Of this, four billion become general litter.“Reusable Shopping Bags…What’s the Buzz?,” Notawaste.com, http://www.notawaste.com/articles/reusable_shopping_bags.html. Consumers and retailers are recognizing this, encouraging new behavior, and now it is almost fashionable to bring your reusable shopping bags to your local store. As of 2011, more than two-thirds of consumers indicated that they now use reusable shopping bags.

Another one of the keys to sustainable packaging is to ensure that the product-to-packaging ratio is “right-sized”—meaning that the product tightly fits in the packaging and there is no wasted use of packaging materials or “air space.” This is not only for the package itself but also for the packing case, which houses multiples of the products for shipping. This is often referred to as “cube optimization.” Cube optimization means right-sizing packages and fitting orders into packaging dimensions that are as small as possible without threatening the integrity of the order. Tight packaging-to-product ratios accomplish two things: (1) they reduce use of packaging materials and (2) they reduce energy costs as the pallet loads are more condensed and the manufacturer is not paying to transport “air.” Additionally, as more and more products are being shipped globally in containers by ocean, air, trucks, and rail, every inch of transport space and fuel usage is significant. This is an example of a win-win situation for the business and the environment, as shipping more in the same volume of space cuts shipping costs, impacting the business bottom line, while reducing the amount of energy (and associated greenhouse gas [GHG] emissions) needed, positively impacting the environmental “bottom line.”
Using renewably sourced materials is another way companies can create more sustainable packaging. Renewable materials are those that utilize forest, fiber, and agriculture products. Nonrenewable materials are those like plastic or Styrofoam, which are derived from petroleum and other fossil fuels.
Walmart’s Packaging Sustainability Initiative
Walmart has pledged to eliminate twenty million metric tons of GHG emissions from their global supply chain by the end of 2015. That is 150 percent of the company’s estimated global carbon footprint growth over the next five years.Walmart, “Remarks as Prepared for Mike Duke, President and CEO of Walmart Greenhouse Gas Goal Announcement,” news release, February 25, 2010, http://walmartstores.com/pressroom/news/9669.aspx. As part of this initiative, Walmart is planning to reduce its packaging globally by 5 percent versus their 2008 baseline. Through a sustainable packaging scorecard that Walmart has developed and put in place to help monitor their suppliers’ efforts, Walmart can track and use their immense weight to push suppliers to help them achieve their goals. The following are some of their notable successes with their suppliers to date:Kevin Hagen, “The Effects of Walmart’s Packaging Scorecard on Environmental Sustainability,” Yahoo!, January 22, 2010, http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/2614159/the_effects_of_walmarts_packaging_scorecard_pg2.html?cat=3.

Price is the monetary (or bartered) amount a consumer pays for a product or service based on the product or service’s value or worth. For sustainable products, pricing has often been an issue limiting a product’s or service’s mass acceptance and market growth. Green products tend to be more expensive because the ingredients may cost more than their conventional counterparts. For example, organic food grown with natural fertilizers may be more expensive than those foods not utilizing natural fertilizers. Manufacturing and transportation costs can also be higher. For example, if the transport costs use a higher cost but lower polluting renewable energy fuel source, this will contribute to a higher price point. This creates a price gap between conventional products and those that are sustainable, which is often referred to as the “green pricing gap.” The higher price can be a barrier to wide market acceptance for many green products, as some consumers may want to purchase products that are better for the environment but either do not want or are financially unable to pay a higher price. For the large majority of consumers, if they do not receive additional value from a sustainable product, for example, in the form of reduced energy costs or longer product lives, they will not pay a premium for the sustainable product. If a product is competitive in terms of price, as well as product, place, and promotion, with traditional products and services, sustainability can give that product a competitive edge particularly among consumers with some interest in sustainability such as the middle green.
Marketers need to minimize the price barrier either by reducing the price point to be closer to its conventional counterparts or through marketing efforts to raise the perceived value to command a premium. Products, such as organic food brands, Earth’s Best, and Starbucks with their fair trade coffee, have done a commendable job in creating greater perceived value, thus commanding premium pricing. Some green product marketers use effective targeting to minimize the green price gap by targeting either people who are better off financially (those who can better afford to take environmental factors into their consumption decisions) or particular market or consumer groups, such as super greens and green regional markets (e.g., Portland, Oregon), with concentrations of potential customers who derive value in conspicuous conservation and demonstrating their environmentalism.Lindsay Kauffman, “Green as a Status Symbol: Why Increased Prices May Increase Sales,” Triplepundit.com, http://www.triplepundit.com/2011/05/green-status-increase-prices-increase-sales.
When Price and Quality Are the Same, Preferring to Support a Worthy Cause
A 2011 Cone/Echo Global Study revealed that when price and quality are about the same, consumers will pick the brand that is supporting a worthy cause like sustainability.“2011 Cone/Echo Global CR Report,” Cone Communications, http://www.coneinc.com/2011globalcrreport.

To that end, consider the American family of four who spends an average $115.60 per week on groceries.Food Marketing Institute, U.S. Grocery Shopper Trends (Food Marketing Institute, 2010), 107; “Key Facts,” Food Marketing Institute, accessed April 1, 2010, http://www.fmi.org. If the green products cost 10 percent to 25 percent more, their $115.60 per week yields significantly less purchasing power. This is even more pronounced in a weak economy. Yet many sustainable business practices, such as using materials with longer life, can save consumers money in the long term. Pricing is key in the marketing mixA planned mix of the controllable elements of a product’s marketing plan commonly termed as the four Ps (product, price, place, and promotion). and marketers of sustainable products and services need to ensure the price and value equation is right for maximum success.

What Really Motivates Consumers: Green Earth or Green Cash?
Marketers take notice. One way to create a so-called win-win for consumers of sustainable products is to capitalize on what can help really motivate consumers to use green products—cost savings from using green products. Some consumers recognize this benefit as some green products save them money in the long run, such as driving a hybrid car saves at the gas pump; energy efficient light bulbs, refrigerators, washers, and dryers save on energy costs; water conservation shower heads save on the water bill; and using refillable water bottles is much cheaper than buying plastic water bottles at the store. Combining a concrete benefit like saving money with a sustainable benefit strengthens the brand messaging and may help to minimize the green pricing gap.
Place is where the product can be purchased and includes how the product is distributed to the purchase location. Place can be a physical store as well as a virtual store on the Internet, also known as an e-tailer. Amazon is probably one of the best and biggest examples of an e-tailer as it has no “brick and mortar” storefronts.
Some sustainability focused retailers with brick and mortar storefronts are moving toward more sustainable practices. Retailers like Kohl’s are implementing solar energy panels in some of their stores. Walmart is building more energy-efficient stores, using more alternative fuels in its trucks, and reducing packaging.Dan Sewell, “Retailers See Green in ‘Green’ Business,” MSNBC.com, April 23, 2010, http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/36739333/ns/business-going_green/t/retailers-see-green-green-business.
A place-related sustainable marketing area of increased interest is buying locally. According to the 2011 Nielsen global online consumer survey, belief in the positive impact of local products is highest in North America, where 65 percent of consumers reported that local goods have a positive impact on the environment.
Consumers are increasingly concerned about the environment and carbon emissions from transporting goods over long distances. Increasing numbers of local retailers are promoting themselves as local with the associated environmental and community economic benefits associated with local residents buying from local businesses compared to national and international companies. Some larger companies are recognizing the interest in buying local by increasing their use of local suppliers. This includes Whole Foods stores buying from local farmers and fisheries.

Whole Foods: Buy Local Strategy
We are permanently committed to buying from local producers whose fruits and vegetables meet our high quality standards, particularly those who farm organically and are themselves dedicated to environmentally friendly, sustainable agriculture. We are greatly increasing our efforts in this regard by further empowering our individual store and regional buyers to seek out locally grown produce.
What is local? Local produce is by definition seasonal. In spring in California, that means artichokes; summer in Michigan means blueberries and autumn in Washington means apples. We value this natural diversity, and each of our 11 regions has its own firm guidelines for using the term “local” in our stores. While only products that have traveled less than a day (7 or fewer hours by car or truck) can even be considered for “local” designation, most stores have established even shorter maximum distances. Ask a team member for your store’s definition of “local.”

Retailers are increasingly scrutinizing their suppliers and demanding that the products that they sell meet higher sustainability standards. Walmart has implemented a sustainability scorecard that scrutinizes their suppliers’ and vendors’ entire product development cycle to ensure that they are implementing sustainable practices and continually looking to improve on these practices. If they are not, Walmart has stated that they will not carry the products. Other retailers are also beginning to demand that their suppliers meet sustainability hurdles including Safeway, Kroger, and Target.
The distribution channel is a significant consideration for sustainable marketing practices. Companies that are sustainability-minded are looking at ways to reduce their carbon footprint through a variety of efforts. Transportation with fuel-efficient loads, using alternative energy sources, and optimizing distribution routes are a few of the examples that can favorably impact the distribution channel in a sustainable way.
Promotion is the communication tools and tactics that a company uses to promote and market their product. There are many ways to communicate a company’s products and benefits. Branding is the cornerstone of the communications platform.
A brandAn image in the consumer’s mind for a particular product or service. It is defined by a perception, good or bad, which consumers or prospects associate with a particular product or service. is an image in the consumer’s mind for a particular product or service. Strong sustainable brands should have a brand image of the product or service having a positive impact on people and the environment. Stonyfield’s brand positioning of “healthy food, healthy people, healthy planet” stems directly from the company’s strategic vision.
Advertising, public relations, personal selling, consumer and trade promotion, social mediaMedia that is interactive, instantaneous, and mobile and allows consumers to interact with one another and share information anytime, anywhere., digital marketing, and mobile marketing are all marketing promotion tools. When determining which mediums to utilize, marketers need to consider (1) marketing objectives, (2) effective reach of mediums among identified target audiences, and (3) budget. It is best to use a mix of promotion vehicles to most effectively and efficiently reach the target market and consistently apply the branding and messaging to maximize awareness. The messaging is best when it elicits a call to action on the consumer’s part—that is, purchase, engagement, and loyalty.
Nike recently made a big splash with its marketing focused on creating a better world through sports. Their efforts included the first 100 percent recycled television advertising, reusing and remixing film from their previous campaigns over the years to create a new spot to introduce their Better World campaign. The digital mash-up showcases the inspiration and history of the brand while bringing attention to the sustainability concept of reuse and reducing resources. This is also a good example whereby utilizing sustainability principles actually benefits the bottom line. By reusing existing film, Nike did not have to spend the thousands of dollars to produce a new television commercial nor expend energy costs for a production shoot. For perspective, an average television commercial cost exceeds $300,000,Tim O’ Leary, “The Latest on How Much It Costs to Produce a TV Commercial,” Bizzy Life, May 23, 2010, http://bizzylife.com/2010/05/the-latest-on-how-much-it-costs-to-produce-a-television-commercial. and an average television shoot is two to three days depending on how many locations are required.
Utility company the Denver Water Company created an advertising campaign that visually highlighted their campaign message of “Use Only What You Need.” This campaign was run on outdoor billboards, print ads, and bus and taxi ads.

Shipping Giant Befriends a Forest: FedEx Sustainable Solutions (click to see video)
FedEx recently launched a charming new ad campaign that highlights their sustainability initiatives. When consumers think of FedEx, sustainability doesn’t usually come first to mind, as it is a shipping and transportation business, which is a large user of fuel, not to mention paper products. But this new commercial highlights FedEx’s environmental efforts that help save forests and fuel and does so with Disney-esque charm. And when you strip away the Hollywood fairy tale dramatics, the spot reveals that FedEx is working hard at sustainable solutions for a better planet.

There are many tools to use for public relations; among them are press releases, press conferences, fact sheets, letters to the editor, guest columns, radio and television talk show appearances, blogs, white paper publishing, speaker engagements, trade shows, and endorsements.
Toyota, when it launched Prius, one of the first hybrid cars, received endorsements from such influential eco-friendly organizations as the United Nations, the Sierra Club, and the National Wildlife Federation. These endorsements helped to establish Toyota’s green brand image and credibility. Utilizing press releases and print ads, Toyota helped to spread the word of their endorsements to maximize awareness. Prius has gone on to be the number one hybrid car in the United States.

One of Simply Green’s (a biofuel company based in Portsmouth, New Hampshire; see Chapter 7 ""Case: Sustainable Business Entrepreneurship: Simply Green Biofuels"") most successful marketing tools was cold calling (phone calls that are unsolicited and without any prior connection) to music industry performers touring in the region. It was through this personal selling technique that Simply Green landed an account filling famous musicians’ tour buses, which earned Simply Green instant fame and credibility.
Free Standing Inserts (FSIs)
FSIs are used as a consumer promotion tool and are typically inserted into Sunday’s newspapers. FSIs are used primarily to distribute coupons to encourage purchase.
Groupon (group + coupon) is an online digital coupon company (http://www.groupon.com) that provides deal-a-day coupons and price incentives. These deals are activated when a certain number of consumers agree to purchase at a specified discount rate.
Toms Shoes: “One for One Movement” (click to see video)
Blake Mycoskie started Toms Shoes on the premise that for every pair of shoes sold, one pair would be donated to a child in need. Toms Shoes recognized that consumers want to feel good about what they buy and thus directly tied the purchase with the donation. This consumer promotion is a buy one give one. In just four years, Toms Shoes has donated more than four hundred thousand shoes, evidence that consumers have clearly embraced the cause.
Using the power of social media, two CEOs created a “rap off” contest utilizing YouTube videos, Facebook, and Twitter. CE-YO Gary Hirshberg, of Stonyfield Yogurt (see Chapter 13 ""Case: Strategic Mission–Driven Sustainable Business: Stonyfield Yogurt""), and CEO Seth Goldman, from Coca-Cola’s Honest Tea, became dueling rappers to promote organics for Earth month. Hirshberg and the “Stonyfield Moms” created a rap video about eating organic (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCA6P9lsEfw&feature=pyv&ad=8718280378&kw=organic%). Not to be outdone, Goldman, who is a longtime friend of Hirshberg’s, thought that they at Honest Tea could do a better rap video and responded with the rap, “Rethink What You Drink” (https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=jeF-65eDLc0#!).
Consumers voted on Facebook for the best rapper team and could upload their own organic rap video to win cash and a supply of Stonyfield Yogurt and Honest Tea. Both Stonyfield and Honest Tea used social media to engage consumers for a sustainable mission and actively encouraged consumer participation. The campaign went viral, receiving many website hits, likes on Facebook, tweets and retweets, and YouTube visits.
Tom’s of Maine, a Kennebunk, Maine–based personal care company owned by Colgate and well known for its sustainable positioning, uses social media to engage their consumers. For example, they introduced their new Wicked Fresh toothpaste and mouthwash with ads running on Facebook’s newsfeed page, a “Wicked Fresh” sweepstakes, a contest, and an online instant win game. The company also used Twitter to promote the contest.
Flash Mobs
Flash mobs are a group of people who assemble suddenly in a public place and perform a choreographed demonstration or performance that catches consumers unaware. Flash mobs are organized via telecommunications or social media.
Pop-up stores are portable store kiosks that are used to catch consumers in high-visibility locations and are only on display for a short period of time. They can be used at sporting events, concerts, or other high-traffic locations. For food and beverage pop-up stores, sampling is often a key marketing tactic used to entice purchase.
Volkswagen creates interactive exhibits in key cities globally to help consumers change their habits to reduce their carbon footprint. Titled “The Fun Theory” (http://thefuntheory.com), they have built interactive exhibits, such as glass bottle recycling bank arcades and piano-based steps in subways that play musical notes when stepped on to encourage more walking versus riding the escalator. By making consumer habit changes fun, Volkswagen is making an impact.
Seventh Generation (see Chapter 8 ""Case: Marketing Sustainability: Seventh Generation Creating a Green Household Consumer Product""), a national manufacturer and distributor of environmentally friendly household and personal care products, recently has been successfully utilizing digital marketing techniques including SEO, retargeting (generating ads that follow consumers by placing cookies on their site based on previous site visits), and pay-per-click.

Sea Bags, a Portland, Maine–based company that makes handmade tote bags from recycled sails, is using a strategic approach with QR codes, incorporating them into its marketing strategy. The QR code directs consumers to a mobile-enabled website that shows a video portraying the company story and commitment to recycling, detailing how they use recycled sails to make their product. Future plans are to include bag tags (also made of recycled sails) with QR codes, which tell consumers their sail’s history and sailing journey around the world.
Andrew Kellar, the founder of Simply Green, used grassroots marketing with a focus on company participation with a nonprofit organization (the New Hampshire Green Alliance) and high-visibility sales with well-known early adopterA person (or group) who embraces new technology or buys products or service before most other people do. customers (touring rock band buses) to build up its customer base to over five hundred in just one year at a very low marketing cost. (See more details in Chapter 7 ""Case: Sustainable Business Entrepreneurship: Simply Green Biofuels"".)
Honest Tea’s Honest Marketing
When Coca-Cola acquired Honest Tea, they began to approach the marketing plan the way the giant marketing behemoth always did—with plenty of national television advertising, deep trade promotion discounts, and slick shelf placement and promotion at retail. The traditional marketing efforts, which normally work well for a more traditional CPG brand, were a flop. Why? Because a big splashy marketing campaign was not in keeping with their “honest” brand image nor did it capitalize on the way that Honest Tea’s following had been built. Honest Tea’s success had been developed through grassroots marketing, which gave the brand an elite following that said, “We are not like everyone else—we require something special.”
Their Honest Cities campaign worked particularly well; Honest Tea set up displays with bottles of tea with a one-dollar collection barrel next to the pallets—purchases on the honor system. They promoted Earth Day by handing out reusable shopping bags with each purchase of Honest Tea. The brand built its presence first in a local market then spread out to the region and then moved to the next local market; the brand then positioned itself to grow into the next region. In addition, the brand continued to focus on the health food chain channel like Whole Foods—not a stronghold for the traditional Coke beverages.Denise Harrison, “Honest Tea Teaches Coke a Lesson,” Simplified Strategic Planning (blog), http://www.cssp.com/strategicplanning/blog/?p=871. So when the big marketing campaign failed, what did Coke do? Coca-Cola went back to basics to effectively develop and implement a marketing plan that personified the brand image and even reprised the Honest Cities campaign, refreshed, of course, using pop-up stores called “The Honest Stand” and social media.Kyana Gordon, “Honest Tea Campaign Stimulates Sales Growth, Brand Awareness, and Honesty,” PSFK, March 9, 2011, http://www.psfk.com/2011/03/honest-tea-campaign-stimulates-sales-growth-brand-awareness-and-honesty.html.

businessleader,https://www.businessleader.co.uk/25-sustainable-uk-companies-that-are-out-to-save-the-planet/66208/ ,"You can’t escape it in the news: climate change is upon us. Resources may be scarce, biodiversity may be threatened, and the situation may be dire – but here is a list of 25 UK businesses which are doing their bit to save the planet.
1. Aerial Power
London-based Aerial Power has created a drone-based system for cleaning solar panels. The Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is self-flying, making the system more efficient, cheaper, and more environmentally friendly than traditional cleaning methods. It could have big implications for solar farms in arid regions of the world, where there is an abundance of sun but the build-up of dust prevents the panels from working properly.
2. Ananas Anam
Ananas Anam created Piñatex, a natural and sustainable textile produced from pineapple leaves. The production of leather and synthetic alternatives is damaging to the environment; Piñatex is made from a natural agricultural waste product, creates low water use and low production waste, and contains no harmful chemicals or animal products.
3. BBC Earth
Following the global success of Blue Planet II, BBC Earth teamed up with Mother of Pearl to launch a sustainable fashion brand at this year’s London Fashion Week. From June, a line of evening wear made from organic silk and inspired by nature will be sold at Net-a-Porter.
Much of Blue Planet II focused on the impact we are having on the world’s oceans. The fast fashion industry alone causes a huge amount of damage to the planet – and this is just one of the brands which offers shoppers an alternative.
4. bio-bean
bio-bean recycles waste coffee grounds to make Coffee Logs. Each carbon neutral log is made from the grounds of 25 cups of coffee and burns 20% hotter and longer than kiln-dried wood. Repurposing coffee waste generates 80% less emissions than if the grounds go to landfill.
bio-bean’s ethos is that there is no such thing as waste – only resources in the wrong space.
5. BuyMeOnce
Most online shopping sites want to you buy as much as possible. Not BuyMeOnce – this online store is all about waste reduction.
These days, products are not made to last (looking at you, Apple). Consumers buy products for cheap prices then throw away and replace them when they inevitably fall apart. BuyMeOnce offers shoppers a curated selection of gifts, homeware, clothing, and beauty products that are built to last for the long term, including a collection with a lifetime guarantee.
6. Celtic Renewables
Based in Edinburgh, Celtic Renewables is the first company to create biofuel from whisky by-products. Only 10% of what flows out of a distillery is future whisky: the rest is mainly draff and pot ale. Celtic Renewables combines these by-products to create high-value renewable products, including biobutanol.
The whisky industry produces an estimated 1,600 million litres of pot ale and 500,000 tonnes of draff each year. That’s a lot of alternative fuel.
7. Crické
With the meat industry under fire for its contributions to climate change, there is an urgent need to find sustainable protein alternatives. Crickets need 0.05% of the water than cows do to produce the same amount of protein. 200m2 are needed to produce 1kg of beef; 15m2 for 1kg of crickets. And crickets produce 1% of the greenhouse gases that cows produce.
They have more protein than beef, more iron than spinach, more calcium than milk. And now they come in the form of snackable crackers and tortilla chips, courtesy of Crické.
8. Greenhouse PR
Greenhouse PR focus on PR with a purpose. The independent agency focuses on companies and NGOs which are out to make positive change.
They’ve run campaigns on launching the UK’s first lentil harvest; cleaning up baby food ingredients; and advancing the smart energy grid. And as a certified B Corp, Greenhouse PR practice what they preach.
9. Green Tomato Cars
Green Tomato Cars are out to clean up the Big Smoke. Having been the first taxi operator to use the Toyota Prius way back in 2006, they are now pioneering fully zero-emission corporate transport with the UK’s largest fleet of hydrogen fuel cell EVs.
As London’s eco-friendly taxi service, the company has a fleet of 600 hybrid vehicles which together complete 10,000 journeys a week. As an added bonus, the cars’ (limited) emissions are offset by the company’s project in Uganda which subsidizes fuel-efficient cookstoves. They also plant almost 200 trees a year as a community initiative.
10. Grow Bristol

Watch this space – these could be the farms of the future.
11. Igloo
Igloo don’t offer renewables – yet – but what they do offer is smart energy. The company uses technology to empower customers and help them understand their energy usage in order to limit waste.
In January, Igloo launched an EV charging app in partnership with Tesla. The app links a customer’s EV and Igloo accounts then automatically charges the vehicles in times when carbon emissions are at their lowest – for example, during periods when the National Grid is powered by renewables.
12. Kabloom
Kabloom sell products which are unabashedly fun as well as eco-friendly. ‘Seedboms’, shaped like grenades, are biodegradable packages filled with themed selections of seeds. There’s a catnip seedbom, a butterfly bom, and a pollinator beebom. It’s pretty simple really: you soak it, throw it, grow it.
You can be good and grow them in your own garden, or you can be better and try guerrilla gardening – seedboming neglected public spaces to make them greener and help local wildlife.
13. Kelda Technology
With the UN predicting a 40% global water deficit by 2030, Kelda Technology is out to design the world’s most efficient shower system. Kelda’s Triple-E Technology uses half the water and heating of a standard shower, while offering 2.4 times the spray force.
14. Leon Restaurant
Leon Restaurants pride themselves on sustainability. They focus on seasonal, local produce; limit meat on the menu; and are in the process of reducing their plastic use.
Leon takeaways are served in compostable packaging and the company replaced plastic straws and cutlery this year with biodegradable alternatives. What’s more, over one third of the menu is vegan, and over two-thirds of dishes are vegetarian.
15. Lush
Lush has put a lot of effort into building an environmentally conscious brand. It invented the first solid shampoo bar and offers packaging-free products instore. It is also in the process of eliminating palm oil from its products.
Lush has an extensive vegan range, is against animal testing, and regularly offers limited edition products to raise money for good causes.
16. MacRebur Roads
MacRebur Roads are tackling two problems: the build up of plastic waste around the world, and the cost and danger of low-quality roads. By mixing non-recyclable plastic waste with asphalt, MacRebur Roads create more durable road surfaces and help to build a circular economy.
For each kilometer of road, they use the equivalent weight of 684,000 bottles or 1.8 million single use plastic bags. One tonne of MacRebur mix contains the equivalent of 80,000 plastic bottles.
17. One Planet Pizza
Whatever your thoughts on veganism, the facts remain: the meat and dairy industries are accelerating climate change. Yet the thought of giving up pizza… it’s almost too much to contemplate.
Enter: One Planet Pizza, the UK’s first frozen vegan pizza company. One Planet Pizza adds nutritional boosts to its pizzas, uses compostable and carbon neutral boxes, and produce pizzas with 45% of the carbon footprint of non-vegan pizzas.
18. Pavegen
Pavegen has created a smart flooring solution which converts footsteps into electricity. As people walk across the Pavegen system, the weight from their footsteps compresses electromagnetic generators below, producing 2 to 4 joules of off-grid electrical energy per step.
It may not sound like much, but imagine Pavegen tiles in the world’s busiest buildings and transport hubs.
19. PensionBee
Fintech company PensionBee helps users to consolidate all their pensions in one pot. Users pick from a selection of plans, including a tracker plan, a Shariah plan, and one that tailors your risk level to your age.

The plan’s money manager, Legal & General, actively engages with companies the fund invests in to drive positive change.

Snact added banana bars to their range in 2017. All of Snact’s products are vegan, gluten free, and high in fibre.
21. Toast Ale
Did you know that 44% of bread is wasted? Yorkshire-based Toast Ale wants to put that waste to work.

businessoffashion,https://www.businessoffashion.com/reports/sustainability/measuring-fashions-sustainability-gap-download-the-report-now ,"Key Insights
The inaugural BoF Sustainability Index tracks fashion’s progress towards ambitious sustainability targets for the coming decade. It examines public disclosures to rigorously benchmark performance and enable like-for-like comparisons at 15 of fashion’s largest companies.
While fashion companies are speaking about sustainability more than ever before, BoF’s comprehensive analysis found actions are lagging public commitments, even among the industry’s largest and most highly resourced businesses.
The average overall score of the companies assessed was just 36 out of a possible 100, with significant disparities between engagement and action. Overall, progress skews towards target setting, with data often self-reported and unverified, pointing to a wider accountability challenge.
The global economy has 10 years to avoid catastrophic climate change and an urgent duty to improve the welfare of the workers who make it tick.
Fashion has a prominent role to play in solving these dual challenges, both because of its global scale and its cultural influence. While fashion brands have stepped up their commitments to operate more responsibly, measuring progress in a comparable, standardised way is a monumental task.
Like-for-like comparisons between companies are distorted by varying degrees of disclosures. Opaque working practices and fuzzy definitions of what constitutes “good” progress complicate matters further, creating a woolly picture of where the industry is at and what steps are required for it to clean up its act.
A new report from The Business of Fashion — The BoF Sustainability Index — aims to offer a transparent and trusted benchmark to track clearly defined, measurable progress. It employs a proprietary methodology to examine 15 of fashion’s largest companies as a proxy to measure overall industry headway.
While the months-long research and analysis found pockets of innovation and action, the average overall score of the companies assess was just 36 out of a possible 100 and substantial challenges still remain.
The index is built on over 5,000 data points gathered across the 15 companies included in this year’s edition. To request access to the full underlying data, click here.
Overall, the analysis revealed clear challenges and opportunities that must be resolved in the next decade if fashion is to align with global climate and sustainable development goals.
Discourse Outpaces Action: Companies need to move past target-setting to demonstrate tangible progress.
The Trust Deficit: Fashion needs to fix its misinformation problem with transparent supply chains and quality data
The Finance Gap: Companies are not matching bold ambitions with details of how they plan to pay for them.
The Growth Conundrum: Achieving commitments to reduce the industry’s footprint requires companies to disentangle growth from impact.
Collaboration with Clout: Impactful and inclusive industry-wide efforts are needed to drive swift progress beyond the current baseline.
A New Social Contract: Fashion must finally get to grips with systemic inequalities in its supply chain.
Pushing Boundaries: Pockets of innovation are emerging in areas like circularity and regenerative agriculture, creating fresh opportunities for positive change.
The aim of the Index is not to celebrate or chastise any company but to take stock of the progress that has been made, leverage data to objectively identify shortcomings and lay out a clear framework for future advancements.
The Index examines the five biggest public companies by annual revenue in three distinct fashion industry verticals — luxury, high street and sportswear. It uses 338 metrics across six categories to measure performance against 16 ambitious environmental and social targets set by The Business of Fashion in consultation with a group of respected global experts.
This report is the first in a series of analyses based on the The BoF Sustainability Index’s key findings that will publish in the lead-up to the United Nations Climate Change Conference to be held in Glasgow, UK from November 1-12, 2021.
The inaugural BoF Sustainability Index benchmarks the performance of fashion’s largest companies against ambitious environmental and social goals that must be achieved in the next decade.

The BoF Professional Summit: Closing Fashion's Sustainability Gap
On April 14 2021, BoF will convene leading sustainability experts and global thought leaders for a 3-hour live broadcast of interactive conversations and panel discussions, in which we'll unpack findings from The BoF Sustainability Index and outline the steps that need to be taken over the coming decade to align the industry with global climate goals and social imperatives. Space is limited.
As a BoF Professional member, register now to reserve your spot. If you are not a member, you can take advantage of our 30-day trial to experience all of the benefits of a BoF Professional membership, including the Summit.
The BoF Sustainability Index is based on a binary assessment that examines companies’ public disclosures up until December 31, 2020. There are limitations to this approach and while the assessment was conducted in good faith, the results should be viewed as a proxy for sustainability performance and not an absolute measure. Where BoF was unable to identify public evidence to support a company’s performance relating to the assessment criteria, it does not necessarily mean the company is taking no action at all or that bad practices are present. Read the full methodology on pages 38-41 in the report here or see the FAQs.
BoF accepts advertising arrangements from a range of partners, some of which may appear in The Sustainability Index. Such advertising arrangements and the Index are handled by separate parts of the business in order to ensure that BoF’s continued commitment to editorial integrity and independence is maintained, and any advertising arrangements between BoF and a partner shall have no impact on the methodology or outcome of the Index assessment. LVMH is part of a group of investors who, together, hold a minority interest in The Business of Fashion. All investors have signed shareholders’ documentation guaranteeing BoF’s complete editorial independence. . ",False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False

Sustainability Entrepreneurship and Innovation
Business as usual is over!
Objectives of the programme
This Master of Science degree in Sustainability Entrepreneurship and Innovation is designed for aspiring change makers who want to apply the tools of business to solving the world’s most urgent social and environmental problems. Whether students set out to integrate sustainability practices into a corporation, start their own purpose-driven companies, or anything in between, this MSc empowers them to drive change within teams, firms, and industries.
A two-year residential programme based in Berlin and Paris, the Master in Sustainability Entrepreneurship and Innovation builds on the latest thinking on sustainable business, entrepreneurship and innovation.
Over six terms, students will gain a practical understanding of relevant business concepts and methods, such as values-based innovation management and business modelling, as well as direct experience in the field on an internship, a consulting engagement, or a business development project.
ESCP Berlin’s Vision Of Sustainability
Sustainability is a Key Academic Area at ESCP Berlin. It entails various study programmes, research projects and ESCP Berlin’s activities in the pursuit of itself becoming a sustainable organisation. This Key Academic Area is devoted to finding answers to essential questions within the field of sustainability entrepreneurship and management. Selected experts from renowned companies and NGOs support the school as a Sustainability Advisory Board.
Practical idealism
We believe students of this programme will be pragmatic idealists. Most students will have backgrounds in economics, natural sciences, or engineering. They are fluent in English and interested in pursuing an international business career that is focused on building innovative and sustainability-driven companies that aim to solve urgent issues such as poverty, degradation of natural ecosystems or climate change.
This full-time, two-year programme is taught entirely in English, but most serious sustainability problems cross borders, so students study a second language as well. Cross-cultural perspectives are further encouraged through conversations with ESCP’s international faculty and students as well as frequent speakers.

The projects provide students with collaborative and intercultural work experience on a case provided by a company.
In groups of 4-5, students are expected to perform an in-depth analysis and make recommendations for actions that can realistically be implemented by the company.
At the heart of the programme, the Company Consultancy Projects are a key element of the programme that enables students to get to know a sector or a specific function. They require significant commitment and focus from the students.
Through the Company Consultancy Project, students learn how to work efficiently as a team and hone their skills in:
- Project planning and management
- Data collection and analysis
- Development of hypotheses and recommendations
- Customer service
- Public speaking and presentations
Within the framework of the Company Consultancy Projects, dedicated workshops are carried out such as:
- Client interaction
- Presentation skills
Throughout the project, tutoring is provided by an ESCP professor.
Students learn how to approach an issue with a critical mindset, and how to react swiftly in unexpected situations with a creative and open-minded attitude.

Starting in February of the second year, students must draft a professional thesis in consultation with an ESCP Professor, which is based on the course ""research methods"" (term 4). The topic chosen is approved beforehand by an academic advisor. The thesis is defended orally to a committee between June and July. This individual applied research project is an essential part of the programme, since it leads to in-depth analysis. It represents 20 of the total of 120 ECTS credits earned over the two years.
Network of Business Mentors
Learning from ESCP’s entrepreneurship ecosystem
ESCP has a large network of companies and entrepreneurs, which offers unique access to the entrepreneurial ecosystem in Berlin and beyond. This special access to entrepreneurial ecosystems is used to connect students of the MSc in Sustainability Entrepreneurship and Innovation to business mentors.
These mentors will support our students during their one-year “Sustainable Entrepreneurship & Innovation Projects” (SEIPs). The SEIPs are hands-on business ideation projects, from opportunity recognition to business planning, that allow our students to gain in-depth insights into the practical challenges of entrepreneurship and innovation.
Typically, four students form an SEIP team which is guided by one experienced mentor.
ESCP is currently setting up a new network of business mentors for the MSc in Sustainability Entrepreneurship and Innovation (as of April 2019).

Careers
Demand is up for values-based change agents and entrepreneurs: more companies than ever see sustainability as an essential part of their mission.
However, the new corporate commitment should be seen as the floor of our forecast, not the ceiling. Given the world’s many pressing concerns – climate change, aging populations, income inequality, and more – it’s hard to think of any industry or sector that could benefit more from talented and socially aware entrepreneurs.
The first class of the MSc in Sustainability Entrepreneurship and Innovation started in September 2018. After their graduation in September 2020, our students will be part of the ESCP 65,000-member alumni network in over 150 countries in the world.

sbu,https://online.sbu.edu/news/2016/11/30/how-integrate-sustainability-your-business ,"How to Integrate Sustainability Into Your Business
Organizations today recognize the importance of incorporating social, environmental and governance considerations into the planning and operation of their core businesses. With plenty of opportunities arising from trends in worldwide sustainability, many companies and their leaders are adopting sustainable development plans in response to social and environmental issues that affect their business operations. In fact, consumers worldwide have become more and more likely to associate and remain loyal to a company that incorporates sustainable practices into its business.
So, just how can you successfully integrate sustainability into your business?
1. Establish a clear sustainability objective
Corporate sustainability is an achievable goal, provided that organizations plan and include their sustainability strategies within their corporate agenda. As a business, you need to consider the four primary factors necessary for developing a sustainable plan. They include: eco-efficiency programs, management infrastructure, marketing programs and strategic initiatives. You should then appoint a sustainability leader who has the right credentials, abilities and experience to lead the company’s sustainability efforts. Fortune 500 companies have created positions such as Chief Sustainability Officers or Directors to ensure their sustainability objectives are met.
2. Engage your business partners
As a business, you can do everything possible to ensure the drive of your environmental and social impacts within your operations, but you can only advance in a big way if you align with your suppliers, distributors and other members in your value chain. Effective collaboration is the key to accelerating sustainability across your industry or value chain. This collaboration is bound to help you and your industry peers, as well as environmental organizations, to reduce the negative impact of your operations and potentially innovate new processes and products toward this end.
3. Engage customers regarding the need for sustainability
You can only do so much without the support of your customers. If they are unwilling to purchase products perceived to be environmentally friendly or fair-trade products, integrating sustainability into your business will be difficult. You need to engage customers nationally about sustainability so they can make decisions based on sustainable living as well as responsible consumption. Most customers purchase products depending on the price or features, and not whether they are using recycled materials or environmentally friendly packaging. Therefore, as a business you need to engage with customers and convince them to commit to recycling, responsible consumption, carpooling and more.
4. Communicate sustainability goals throughout your organization
It is highly important that you design a way to effectively communicate your business’s vision of sustainability to everyone in your organization. Each and every individual, regardless of their role in the company, needs to understand and embrace that sustainability vision. Integration of sustainability into companies has been difficult, especially because sustainability and corporate social responsibility implementation remain the job of a single person or department within many companies.
5. Develop conditions that support sustainability-related innovations
The NBS’s report on Innovating for Sustainability, produced in 2013, described various ways companies and businesses can reduce their negative impact on the environment, create positive social changes that benefit their business, and re-create/develop their business models. As a business, you should not consider integrating innovation-related sustainability plans as risky. Instead, drive your company’s innovation by looking for trends in emerging economies and other industries, creating partnerships with colleges to fill any knowledge gaps within your organization, and developing incentives to reward employees who suggest ways to advance recycling, save energy, improve product sustainability and other ideas.
All in all, highlighting your company’s sustainability efforts and being open to the public about it can noticeably profit your company. Work on promoting your company’s use of green technology as well as other social and environmental initiatives. Your company will benefit greatly by receiving positive PR (public relations) with both your current and potential customers. .

TACKLING GLOBAL CHALLENGES
Our products already make an indispensable contribution to society by providing the most sustainable options for a wide range of societal needs. For example, preservation of food and clean water; construction of wind turbines, solar panels and other renewable technologies; for construction of lighter and more fuel-efficient vehicles and aircraft; for medical devices and applications; for clothing and apparel; and for insulation and other industrial and home applications. If polymers and plastics were to be replaced to the maximum extent in applications where they can be substituted, overall life-cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in Europe would increase by more than 50%.
Following the Paris Climate Agreement of 2015, most nation states have set the goal to achieve a net zero emission economy by 2050, and are adopting regulations and legislation to support this. As part of this, there is widespread acceptance that we should strive for a circular economy, in which materials are re-used to their maximum extent In response, INEOS businesses have put in place the plans and actions needed to ensure that they that they lead the transition to a net zero economy by no later than 2050, whilst remaining profitable, and staying ahead of evolving regulations and legislation.

Abstract
While the terms Circular Economy and sustainability are increasingly gaining
traction with academia, industry, and policymakers, the similarities and
differences between both concepts remain ambiguous. The relationship
between the concepts is not made explicit in literature, which is blurring their
conceptual contours and constrains the efficacy of using the approaches in
research and practice. This research addresses this gap and aims to provide
conceptual clarity by distinguishing the terms and synthesising the different
types of relationships between them. We conducted an extensive literature
review, employing bibliometric analysis and snowballing techniques to
investigate the state of the art in the field and synthesise the similarities,
differences and relationships between both terms. We identified eight different
relationship types in the literature and illustrated the most evident similarities
and differences between both concepts.

1. Introduction
There is a pressing need to transition to more sustainable sociotechnical
systems (Meadows et al., 2004; WBCSD, 2010; Seiffert, 2005; Markard, 2012).
Environmental problems, such as biodiversity loss, water, air, and soil pollution,
resource depletion, and excessive land use are increasingly jeopardising the
earth's life-support systems (Rockström et al., 2009; Jackson, 2009; Meadows
et al., 2004; WWF, 2014). Societal expectations are not met due to issues such
as high unemployment, poor working conditions, social vulnerability, the poverty
trap, inter- and intragenerational equity, and widening inequalities (Banerjee
and Duflo, 2011; Sen, 2001; Prahalad, 2004). Economic challenges, such as
supply risk, problematic ownership structures, deregulated markets, and flawed
incentive structures lead to increasingly frequent financial and economic
instabilities for individual companies and entire economies (Sachs, 2015;
Jackson, 2009).
To address these and other sustainability issues, the concept of the Circular
Economy – while not entirely new – has recently gained importance on the
agendas of policymakers (Brennan et al., 2015). This becomes evident, for
instance, in the comprehensive European Circular Economy package
(European Commission, 2015) and the Chinese Circular Economy Promotion
Law (Lieder and Rashid, 2016). The Circular Economy has also become an
important field of academic research with a steep increase in the number of
articles and journals covering this topic during the last decade. Companies are
also increasingly aware of the opportunities promised by the Circular Economy
and have started to realise its value potential for themselves and their
stakeholders (EMF, 2013 b).
Despite the concept's importance for academia, policymakers, and companies,
the conceptual relationship between the Circular Economy and sustainability is
not clear. This has potential detrimental implications for the advancement of
sustainability science and the diffusion of practices based on these concepts.
Therefore, this research aims to contribute to conceptual clarity by investigating
the similarities, differences, and relationships between both concepts in theory.
The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 covers a brief literature review that
is introducing sustainability and the Circular Economy by presenting their
origins, synthesising their conceptual definition, and illustrating their relevance
for research and practice. The subsequent section describes the research
design by presenting the research questions and the methods employed,
including the implemented snowballing and the outcomes of a bibliometric
research that helped to determine the sample of articles that would initially be
investigated. Section 4 presents the results of the research, first illustrating the
identified relationships between sustainability and the Circular Economy, before
similarities and differences are contrasted. This is followed by a discussion of
our findings. The paper concludes with final remarks on the contributions of this
research, its limitations, and interesting fields for further research.
2. Background
This section provides a short introduction to the two main concepts addressed
in this research, sustainability and the Circular Economy. Starting with the
former and concluding with the latter, this chapter briefly introduces the
historical origins of the concepts, compares and synthesises the selected
definitions, and discusses the notions' relevance.
2.1 Sustainability
Sustainability concerns are increasingly incorporated into both the agendas of
policymakers and the strategies of companies. The term sustainability itself
originates in the French verb soutenir, “to hold up or support” (Brown et al.,
1987) and its modern conception has its origins in forestry. It is based on the
silvicultural principle that the amount of wood harvested should not exceed the
volume that grows again. This conceptualisation was written down already in
the early 18th century in “Sylvicultura oeconomica” (von Carlowitz, 1713), and
there seem to be even older sources that follow the underlying principles in face
of shortages in wood supply and the husbandry of cooperative systems
(Mantel,1990). Later, it was transferred to the context of ecology, as a principle
of respecting the ability of nature to regenerate itself (Duden, 2015), from where
the modern definition of being “able to be maintained at a certain rate or level”
(Dictionary, 2010) developed.
Johnston et al. (2007) estimated that there are around 300 definitions of
sustainability. To cite but a few, sustainability can be defined as a situation in
which human activity is conducted in a way that conserves the functions of the
earth’s ecosystems (ISO 15392, 2008), a transformation of human lifestyle that
optimises the likelihood that living conditions will continuously support security,
well-being, and health, particularly by maintaining the supply of non-replaceable
goods and services (McMichael et al., 2003), or an indefinite perpetuation of all
life forms (Ehrenfeld, 2005).
The concept's uptake can be traced back to the increasing evidence on global-
scale environmental risks, such as ozone depletion, climate change, biodiversity
loss or the alteration of the nitrogen cycle. These risks have been systematically
investigated since the 1960s, raising questions about whether present
prosperity trends can be maintained in the future (Clark and Crutzen, 2005;
Rockström et al., 2009) and, consequently, revealing many sources of tensions.
This includes, for example, the limited store of resources, its uneven
geographical distribution and appropriation (e.g. Georgescu-Roegen, 1977),
and the implications of the assimilative capacities of ecosystems over economic
growth (e.g. Daly and Townsend, 1993).
These sources of tensions were condensed by the environmentalists Ehrlich
and Commoner in their equation “I = P x A x T”. Environmental impact (I) is a
function of three factors: population (P); affluence, which is a proxy to represent
consumption (A); and technologies (T) (Chertow, 2001; Commoner, 1972;
Holdren and Ehrlich, 1974). The emphasis given to population, consumption,
and technologies, as well as the interrelation between these variables, has
varied considerably among scholars. Some emphasise demographic control
(e.g. Hardin, 1968), others would rather advocate for reduction in consumption
levels (e.g. Woollard and Ostry, 2000), and an increasing number of scholars
highlight the role of science, technology, and innovation in fuelling social
inclusion and environmental resilience (e.g. Hart and Milstein, 2003; Kemp and
Pearson, 2007; Cohen, 2006).
The emergence of such tensions fuelled a series of international discussions on
the complex and dynamically interconnected nature of the environment, society
and the economy (Kates et al., 2005). These discussions challenged
oversimplified development frameworks and their assumptions about economic
growth. The Stockholm Conference in 1972 and the report Limits to Growth had
wide repercussions due to their interpretation of “development” and
“environment” as contradictory elements of an intrinsic trade-off (Sachs, 2015;
Jackson, 2009). Nevertheless, the most prominent understanding of sustainable
development arose with the Brundtland Report (1987), which came not as a
reformulation of the terms of such trade-offs, but rather as an answer to its
apparent conflicts (Nobre and Amazonas, 2002): “The concept of sustainable
development does imply limits – not absolute limits but limitations imposed by
the present state of technology and social organization on environmental
resources and by the ability of the biosphere to absorb the effects of human
activities” (Brundtland, 1987:8).
The Brundtland Commission also provided the most commonly accepted
definition of sustainability as “development that meets the needs of the present
without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs”
(Brundtland, 1987). Despite being initially driven by environmental concerns,
the term sustainable development has since then accommodated a variety of
expectations for desirable progress: “the concrete challenges of sustainable
development are at least as heterogeneous and complex as the diversity of
human societies and natural ecosystems around the world” (Kates et al.,
2005:8). The broad colloquial meaning of the verb “to sustain” refers to
maintaining unspecified features over time, while “development” can comprise
multiple interpretations, varying according to values, interests and disciplinary
conventions. Nevertheless, all perceptions of sustainable development seem to
invoke feelings of desirability and goodness (or avoidance and badness),
nurturing reflexivity upon shared responsibilities and alternative directions of
progress (Stirling, 2009).
Particularly relevant to the widespread diffusion of the term and its most
contemporary understandings is the so-called triple bottom line (Elkington,
1997), the three pillars of sustainability: people, profit, and planet. After the
World Summit in 2002, the triple bottom line has been referred to as the
balanced integration of economic, environmental and social performance. The
three spheres are systemically intertwined and continuously and cumulatively
affect one another through mutual causality and positive feedbacks (Mckelvey,
2002). In other words, they act as “as interdependent and mutually reinforcing
pillars” (UN General Assembly, 2005) that can be adapted to a broad range of
different contexts and time horizons (Wise, 2016).
Based on this, and with regards to maintaining the holistic, adaptive, and
flexible nature of sustainability, the term sustainability is framed in this article as
the balanced and systemic integration of intra and intergenerational economic,
social, and environmental performance.
Instead of merely setting common goals, sustainability opens up the scope for
multiple expectations about, for example, what should be developed and what
is to be sustained, for how long, and for the benefit of whom (Acero and
Savaget, 2014). It has encouraged reflexivity on how to expand
intragenerational prosperity while simultaneously preserving life-support
systems needed to meet intergenerational needs.
Despite divergence in the perceived strengths and weaknesses of the term and
its associated responses, sustainability has been institutionalised into the
agendas of policymakers and strategies of large organisations, becoming
cumulatively more embedded into the rules that structure social interventions
and shape behaviour (Hodgson, 2005). While incorporating a broad range of
contradictions and being ambiguously instrumentalised by diverse interest
groups, the concept proves to be a “political concept as persistent as are
democracy, justice and liberty” (O’Riordan, 1993:48).
2.2 Circular Economy
The concept of the Circular Economy has been gaining momentum since the
late 1970s (EMF, 2013b). Several authors, like Andersen (2007), Ghisellini et al.
(2016), and Su et al. (2013) attribute the introduction of the concept to Pearce
and Turner (1989). By describing how natural resources influence the economy
by providing inputs for production and consumption as well as serving as a sink
for outputs in the form of waste, they investigate the linear and open-ended
characteristics of contemporary economic systems. This is influenced by
Boulding's (1966) work, which describes the earth as a closed and circular
system with limited assimilative capacity, and inferred from this that the
economy and the environment should coexist in equilibrium.
Stahel and Reday (1976) introduced certain features of the Circular Economy,
with a focus on industrial economics. They conceptualised a loop economy to
describe industrial strategies for waste prevention, regional job creation,
resource efficiency, and dematerialisation of the industrial economy. Stahel
(1982) also emphasised selling utilisation instead of ownership of goods as the
most relevant sustainable business model for a loop economy, allowing
industries to profit without externalising costs and risks associated with waste.
The contemporary understanding of the Circular Economy and its practical
applications to economic systems and industrial processes has evolved to
incorporate different features and contributions from a variety of concepts that
share the idea of closed loops. Some of the most relevant theoretical influences
are cradle-to-cradle (McDonough and Braungart, 2002), laws of ecology
(Commoner, 1971), looped and performance economy (Stahel, 2010),
regenerative design (Lyle, 1994), industrial ecology (Graedel and Allenby,
1995), biomimicry (Benyus, 2002), and the blue economy (Pauli, 2010).
The most renowned definition has been framed by the Ellen MacArthur
Foundation, introducing the Circular Economy as “an industrial economy that is
restorative or regenerative by intention and design” (2013b: 14). Similarly, Geng
and Doberstein (2008: 231), focusing on the Chinese implementation of the
concept, describe the Circular Economy as the “realization of [a] closed loop
material flow in the whole economic system”. Webster (2015: 16) adds that “a
circular economy is one that is restorative by design, and which aims to keep
products, components and materials at their highest utility and value, at all
times”. Accordingly, Yuan et al. (2008: 5) state that “the core of [the Circular
Economy] is the circular (closed) flow of materials and the use of raw materials
and energy through multiple phases”. Bocken et al. (2016: 309) categorise the
characteristics of the Circular Economy by defining it as “design and business
model strategies [that are] slowing, closing, and narrowing resource loops”.
Based on these different contributions, we define the Circular Economy as a
regenerative system in which resource input and waste, emission, and energy
leakage are minimised by slowing, closing, and narrowing material and energy
loops. This can be achieved through long-lasting design, maintenance, repair,
reuse, remanufacturing, refurbishing, and recycling.
The circular economy has received increased attention in academic research
with a range of reviews on the topic by Andersen (2007), Ghisellini et al. (2016),
Lieder and Rashid (2016), and Su et al. (2013). Specific areas of attention are
closed loop value and supply chains (Guide and Van Wassenhove, 2009; Wells
and Seitz, 2005; Govindan et al., 2015; Stindt and Sahamie, 2014), circular
business models (Bocken et al., 2016) and circular product design (Bakker et
al., 2014).
The work of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation is important in this context. The
Foundation has published a range of publications on the topic, including a book
by Webster (2015) and a series of reports (EMF, 2014, 2013a, 2013b). The
Foundation also acts as a collaborative hub for businesses, policy makers, and
academia. Various consultancies have now tapped into the opportunities of a
Circular Economy (e.g. Lacey and Rutqvist, 2015 and McKinsey through the
support of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation in EMF, 2013a, b, for example).
The concept has also gained traction with policymakers, influencing
governments and intergovernmental agencies at the local, regional, national,
and international level. Germany was a pioneer in integrating the Circular
Economy into national laws, as early as 1996, with the enactment of the
“Closed Substance Cycle and Waste Management Act” (Su et al., 2013). This
was followed by Japan’s 2002 “Basic Law for Establishing a Recycling-Based
Society” (METI, 2004), and China’s 2009 “Circular Economy Promotion Law of
the People's Republic of China” (Lieder and Rashid, 2016). Supranational
bodies have also incorporated circular economy concerns – most notably the
EU’s 2015 Circular Economy Strategy (European Commission, 2015).
3. Research Design
The previous sections summarised the history, definition, and relevance of
sustainability and the Circular Economy. Both concepts are essentially global in
their nature, sharing concerns with the current state of technology, industrial
production, and consumption, which might not only jeopardise future
generations, but also present sources of unexplored competitive advantage.
They also stress the importance of better integrating environmental and social
aspects with economic progress, and set system-level changes at their very
core.
Apart from these similarities, the concepts are notably used in different contexts
and with different purposes. Sustainability, in particular in its early rooting of
sustainable development (Brundtland, 1987), is more open-ended than the
Circular Economy (Yuan et al., 2008) and used to justify a broader variety of
institutional commitments and to signal a wider set of risks and opportunities.
Although both concepts are being adopted by a growing number of academics
and practitioners, the relationship between both notions has not been studied
extensively, and the similarities and differences between them remain
underexplored. Knowledge about their relationship, similarities, and differences
is relevant for conceptual clarity, as well as to reveal the interests and goals
behind the use of these terms by policymakers and companies. Therefore, this
research can assist efforts aiming at integrating these concepts to better
promote social inclusion, environmental resilience, and economic prosperity.
To investigate the research gap, the following two research questions were
formulated:
RQ 1: What are the main conceptual similarities and differences between
sustainability and the Circular Economy?
RQ 2: How is the Circular Economy conceptually related to sustainability?
To work towards answering these two research questions, we employed
different methodological techniques.
First, we conducted a bibliometric research, a well-established form of meta-
analytical research of literature (Kim and McMillan, 2008). This is a method that
analyses published data, measuring texts and information such as authorship,
affiliation, citations, and keywords (Bellis, 2009), unveiling articles and
illustrating linkages between and among articles about a certain research topic
(Fetscherin and Usunier, 2012). It can be used to describe, evaluate and
monitor the state of a particular field over time, evaluating meta-analytically the
development of a given research area to identify their key components and
underlying theoretical frameworks (Fetscherin and Heinrich, 2015). A
bibliometric review was thus conducted to identify the articles that describe both
sustainability and the Circular Economy, while also revealing the most cited
authors, keywords mentioned, and the journals in which they were published.
Data were collected from Web of Science in January 2016 by searching with the
strings “circular economy”, sustainability and ""circular economy"" AND
sustainability, as shown in Table 1. The search was applied to topics and for
publications in English that were published after 1950. These searches helped
identifying the initial sample of papers that would be investigated in depth
through an extensive literature review. Furthermore, as the Circular Economy is
a recent research topic, we observed the importance of analysing its
emergence and progress before analysing its relationship with literature on
sustainability. Therefore, for the 295 records on the Circular Economy, we used
the open source software NAILS to carry out the statistical and network analysis
functions (Knutas et al., 2015) needed to uncover and quantitatively describe
our dataset. It is important to mention that all abstracts resulting from the
searches were scanned to filter out irrelevant publications. The most relevant
results are demonstrated below, in Figures 1 to 4.

Figure 1 shows a steep increase in the number of publications on the Circular
Economy, reaching a more than tenfold growth in the last 10 years.
Nevertheless, the absolute number of publications on the Circular Economy is
small when compared to publications on sustainability (see Table 1). This
finding suggests that research on the Circular Economy may be far from
saturated, and there is great room for improvement in terms of conceptual
development and cross-fertilisation from other research fields.

Figures 2 and 3 show, respectively, the most common locations of authors and
the most cited publications. Only one country (China) has more than 100
publications, presenting almost four times the number of the second in the
ranking, England. The same applies to the most cited publications, as the first,
Journal of Cleaner Production, has more than twice the number of publications
than the second in the ranking. That indicates that a few players have taken the

Circular Economy, such as recycling, reuse, waste management, and eco-

cross-fertilised with the Circular Economy, such as industrial symbiosis and
sustainable development. Interestingly, China, in addition to being the country
of origin of most of the authors, is also one of the most popular keywords,
reflecting the efforts the country has been taking since it began regulatory
implementation in 2009 (Lieder and Rashid, 2016), inspiring not only new
practices and evidences, but also authors covering the geographical contexts
and jurisdictional performances.

Figure 4: Number of occurrences of most important keywords of reviews and
articles with the topic circular economy
These steps offered a better understanding of the coverage of our research
topic and contributed to identifying the sample of articles that should be
investigated in depth through an extensive review of the literature. This review
started with a sample of relevant papers published by highly cited journals and
academics, which was then followed by a semi-structured snowballing approach
(Wohlin, 2014), to capture both established and emerging conceptual trends
(see Figure 5).
The snowballing started with the definition of an initial sample of relevant
papers, which contained 295 documents arising from the search on ""Circular
Economy"". As demonstrated in our bibliometric results, we included publications
since 1950 into our sample, although most publications are dated since 2006
and the numbers of documents increased steeply in the last 4 years.
The authors first scanned the titles and abstracts of these papers, then focusing
on examining the full content of the 67 articles stemming from the search on
""Circular Economy"" AND ""Sustainability"". It is important to stress that we
concentrated on peer-reviewed scientific journal articles in English to ensure the
quality of our sample, but we subsequently selected a limited number of
influential publications from non-profits and international organizations (such as
the OECD and the Ellen MacArthur Foundation). The inclusion of non peer-
reviewed articles was appropriate since Circular Economy is a new area of
research, and its relationship with Sustainability has not been extensively
addressed by peer-reviewed articles.
After reviewing our initial sample, we conducted a process of identifying and
scanning articles referenced by the ones we reviewed, including the relevant
ones into our sample. The inclusion/exclusion process depended on whether
publications can provide new insights on the phenomena investigated, and this
decision was reached after analysing their titles, contents and abstracts. In
other words, relevant papers were defined as the ones capable of contributing
with novel insight on similarities, differences or relationship types between the
studied concepts. Furthermore, if a new paper was included in the sample, we
would also analyse its references, in search for new inputs – and these
iterations would occur until new papers were not contributing significantly to
answer to our research questions.
Figure 5: Literature Review Process
Finally, all papers within our sample were thoroughly examined and contrasted,
by using techniques for content analysis. This was used as a method of
analysing written communication (Elo & Kyngäs, 2008), with the purpose of
providing a condensed description by examining text to reveal patterns. This
was a rather exploratory process, as the categories of similarities, differences
and relationship types were not pre-defined, neither were the relationship types
explicitly defined by the reviewed literature. Therefore, patterns emerged
throughout the content analysis and were subsequently validated through the
triangulation (Creswell, 1998) of the research outputs between the authors of
this article, aiming at ensuring robustness and comprehensiveness of its
conclusions.
4. Results
The following two subsections first summarise the identified relationship types
between the Circular Economy and sustainability, and then, the main similarities
and differences between both concepts in literature.
4.1 Similarities and differences
Table 2 provides an overview of the most relevant similarities between
sustainability and the Circular Economy. Both notions emphasise intra- and
intergenerational commitments motivated by environmental hazards and signal
the importance of increasing agency and public deliberation upon the multiple
and coexisting pathways for development. They also share an essentially global
perspective, emphasising problems on a planetary scale that lead to shared
responsibilities and to the relevance of coordination between multiple agents.
Both concepts frequently employ multi- or interdisciplinary approaches to better
integrate non-economic aspects into development, which often conclude that
system design and innovations are the main drivers for reaching their ambitions.
They also describe not only potential costs and risks, but also the importance of
diversification in taking advantage of distinct opportunities for value creation.
Both concepts view cooperation between stakeholders not only as desirable,
but as imperative to reach their expectations.
To guide and align stakeholder behaviour, both concepts rely heavily on
regulation and increasingly on the deliberate design of incentive structures.
Private business plays a central role among relevant stakeholders because it
commands more capabilities and resources than any other actor. Since the
implementation of more sustainable solutions seems to lag behind expectations
and technological capabilities and advances in material and production
technology are becoming ever more incremental, authors increasingly see
business model innovation as the key pathway to the necessary socio-technical
transitions (see also Geissdoerfer et al. 2016b).
Table 2: Selected similarities between sustainability and the Circular Economy
Similarities between sustainability and the Circular Economy
• Intra and intergenerational commitments
• More agency for the multiple and coexisting pathways of development
• Global models
• Integrating non-economic aspects into development
• System change/design and innovation at the core
• Multi-/interdisciplinary research field
• Potential cost, risk, diversification, value co-creation opportunities
• Cooperation of different stakeholders necessary
• Regulation and incentives as core implementation tools
• Central role of private business, due to resources and capabilities
• Business model innovation as a key for industry transformation
• Technological solutions are important but often pose implementation
problems
The literature review also reveals a range of differences between the two
concepts. For example, the concepts have different origins, goals, motivations,
system prioritisations, institutionalisations, beneficiaries, timeframes, and
perceptions of responsibilities.
The modern understanding of the term Circular Economy seems to have
emerged more recently than that of sustainability. While the Circular Economy
is traced back by EMF (2013b) to different schools of thought like cradle-to-
cradle and industrial ecology, the concept of sustainability is considerably older
(Mantel, 1990) and was institutionalised by environmental movements and
supranational bodies, especially after the publication of the Brundtland report in
1987.
Furthermore, there are different goals associated with the Circular Economy
and sustainability in the literature. While it seems clear to most authors that the
Circular Economy is aiming at a closed loop, eliminating all resource inputs and
waste and emission leakages of the system, the goals of sustainability are
open-ended and different authors address a considerable multitude of goals,
which also shift depending on the considered agents and their interests.
This is also reflected in the main motivation underlying each concept. The
motives behind sustainability are based on past trajectories, are diffused and
diverse, and often embrace reflexivity and adaptivity to different contexts. In
contrast, the Circular Economy is mainly motivated by the observation that
resources could be better used and waste and emissions reduced with circular
rather than linear make-use-dispose systems.
In fact, sustainability aims at benefiting the environment, the economy, and
society at large (e.g. Elkington, 1997), while the main beneficiaries of the
Circular Economy appear to be the economic actors that implement the system.
The environment is also seen to benefit through less resource depletion and
pollution, and society benefits from the environmental improvements and certain
add-ons and assumptions, like more manual labour or fairer taxation (e.g.
Webster, 2015).
Different underlying motivations also lead to different systems being prioritised
in the literature. The Circular Economy clearly seems to prioritise the economic
systems with primary benefits for the environment, and only implicit gains for
social aspects. Sustainability was originally conceptualised as holistically
treating all three dimensions as equal and balanced, although portfolios of
interventions should be prioritised according to contextual differences. For
instance, it is conceptually plausible to design policies and industrial
interventions with more environmental emphasis in rich countries like Sweden,
and more social emphasis in developing countries like Zambia.
The literature also assumes differences in the way both concepts became
institutionalised. While sustainability provides a broader framing (e.g.
Brundtland, 1987), which can be adapted to different contexts and aspirations,
the Circular Economy emphasises economic and environmental benefits
compared to a linear system (e.g. Rashid et al., 2013).
There is also a difference in agency, influencing the understanding of the
agents that should influence system changes. While agency is diffused in the
case of sustainability (e.g. Bocken, 2015), as the priorities should be defined by
all stakeholders, the Circular Economy has a clear emphasis on governments
and companies (e.g. Webster, 2015).
Furthermore, the timeframes for the required changes differ for both concepts.
The temporal dimension for sustainability is open-ended, as goals can be
constantly adapted or reframed over time. In contrast, there are theoretical
limits to optimisation and practical ones to implementation that could set the
thresholds for the successful conclusion of the implementation of a Circular
Economy within a geographical unit (EMF, 2013b).
Finally, the perception of responsibilities is also clearly distinct between both
concepts. In the sustainability debate, responsibilities are shared, but not clearly
defined, while the literature considers that the responsibility for the transition to
a circular system lies primarily with private business, regulators, and
policymakers. Moreover, the commitments, goals, and interests behind the use
of the terms differ greatly. The focus seems to be on interest alignment between
stakeholders for sustainability, whereas the Circular Economy prioritises
financial advantages for companies, and less resource consumption and
pollution for the environment.

discussed in this paper.

4.2 Relationship types
Rashid et al. (2013) describe circularity in business models and supply chains
as a precondition for sustainable manufacturing, which in turn is necessary for
the improved economic and environmental performance of industrialised and
developing countries. Similarly, Läpple (2007) describes a circular economy as
an important element of sustainable development.
A much stronger conditional relationship is assumed by the Ellen MacArthur
Foundation (2013b) and Webster (2015). Maybe even more pronounced, at
least in the environmental dimension, are Bakker et al. (2014), who consider
circularity as absolutely necessary for sustaining economic output. A similar
approach is also held by the United Nations Environment Programme (2006),
which presents the Circular Economy as a necessary condition for maintaining
economic growth in a sustainable way, but here other pathways for establishing
this condition are not excluded.
A third type of conditional relation is identified by Nakajima (2000), who
describes circularity and service-based systems as a necessary but not
sufficient condition for a sustainable system. Other conditions, like a change of
lifestyle, must accompany a closed loop system to pursue long-term
sustainability.
A similar view is held by the European Commission (2014), which presents
circular economic systems as beneficial for different sustainability dimensions
like resource productivity, job creation and GDP growth, but does not elaborate
on whether this is a necessary or sufficient condition or how it relates to other
concepts that could foster sustainability.
Differently, Bocken et al. (2014) identified circularity as one archetype of
sustainable business models among others. Circularity is seen as one of
several options to foster the sustainability of the system. These options are all
seen as beneficial in principle and can also be combined to add up gains or
achieve synergies. Similarly, Evans et al. (2009) and Weissbrod and Bocken (in
press) describe circular strategies as one option among others, like increasing
efficiency or dematerialisation. This is a view that is also shared by other
manufacturing scholars like Allwood et al. (2012), Garetti and Taisch (2012),
and Seliger (2007), who do not explicitly group and highlight circular strategies,
such as reuse and remanufacturing, among other manufacturing and societal
changes that benefit sustainability, like energy efficiency or consumer
sufficiency.
The OECD (2009) holds a hierarchical view and considers closed loop
manufacturing systems to be more sustainable than most other manufacturing
concepts because they comprise more eco-innovation targets and mechanisms.
The only exception in this prioritisation is the industrial ecology framework,
which is seen as even more sustainable.
Negative relationships between circularity and sustainability are also
highlighted. Andersen (2007), for example, describes not only the potential
benefits but also the costs of circular systems that must be balanced to avoid
the creation of negative value. A similar view is held by Allwood (2014), who
suggests a range of problems that the circular economy brings with it, such as
the technical impossibility of a closed circle in combination with growing
demand or problems with the energy required to recycle materials. This energy
and its impact may be higher for many materials than the overall environmental
effect of acquiring the material from conventional sources like mining. Thus, the
circular economy might worsen the emission of greenhouse gasses and, as a
result, accelerate global warming. Therefore, a more pragmatic approach is
necessary, where material efficiency and other forms of reducing inputs should
have higher priority than the circular economy.
Similarly, Murray et al. (2015) argue that while circularity has a positive
influence on certain aspects of sustainability, it does not integrate other
dimensions, especially the social one. These missing dimensions could be
added to the concept of the Circular Economy.
Table 4 provides an overview of the different types of relationships between
sustainability and the Circular Economy that were identified in the research.
These categories aim at stressing the most evident differences identified within
our sample. It is nonetheless important to stress that this table does not aim to
be exhaustive, as each type of relationship could be further subcategorized and
consequently be investigated in more depth.

5. Discussion
Our research shows that most authors (e.g. Bakker et al., 2014; Bocken et al.,
2016; EMF, 2013b; Rashid et al., 2014) focus on the environmental
performance improvements of the Circular Economy rather than taking a holistic
view on all three dimensions of sustainability, although this is also true for a
range of authors in the latter field (e.g. Muniz and Cruz, 2015; Shiva, 1992).
While the environmental perspective taken by sustainability can vary from
explicitly and implicitly holistic to the investigation of a specific set of issues,
most authors conceptually simplify the Circular Economy to resource input,
waste and emission output. Other issues like land use or biodiversity loss are
only implicitly addressed by the latter authors (see e.g. Bakker et al., 2014;
EMF, 2013b).
This more limited focus comprises a narrow coverage of social wellbeing by
most Circular Economy authors. If social aspects are mentioned, the reference
is mostly to job creation, as there seems to be no clear understanding of the
extent to which the circular economy could contribute to subjective well-being
(Frey and Stutzer, 2001). Some authors, like Webster (2015) try to construct
other elements of a social dimension of the Circular Economy by adding a more
just and efficient tax system and changing lifestyles through the shared
economy. However, the conceptual integration is unclear in the work of most
authors, and the increasingly apparent negative effects of the shared economy,
like the deterioration of secure employment that is subject to social insurance
contributions and the elimination of affordable housing in cities and tourist
destinations (Malhotra and Van Alstyne, 2014), in fact imply detrimental effects
on social inclusion and wellbeing.
The Circular Economy also refers mostly to individual economic benefits
through input reduction, efficiency gains, and waste avoidance with relatively
immediate results compared to sustainability (e.g. EMF, 2013b; Elkington,
1997). Differently from sustainability, long-term viability seems to be excluded
from most discussions (e.g. EMF, 2013b; Brundtland, 1987). Furthermore, the
behaviour of organisational actors and consumers should be nudged with
incentives in the Circular Economy, while many sustainability approaches
favour behaviour change through engagement and education, although
incentives also play an increasing role in the literature (e.g. Webster, 2015;
Jackson, 2009).
While some authors consider the interpretive flexibility of the sustainability
paradigm as a strength, that allows its adaptation to different contexts and wide
institutionalisation (e.g. Leach et al., 2007), others argue that it is too vague
and, consequently, hinders operationalisation (e.g. Middleton and O’Keefe,
1993). The concept of Circular Economy, on the other hand, is often seen as
more narrowly framed by these authors, which would provide clearer directions
for its implementation. This is sometimes accompanied by a – seemingly
unrealistically promising – business case for the private sector (e.g. EMF,
2013b).
Also because many conceptualisations of the Circular Economy (e.g. Allwood et
al., 2012; Bakker et al., 2014) appear to exclude large parts of the social
dimension, emphasise economic benefits, and simplify the environmental
perspective, the concept might be more attractive for policy makers and private
business than competing approaches. This can be problematic for the transition
to a more sustainable economic system because attention and resources are
diverted from more comprehensive and holistic approaches.
To address this issue, we consider the identified subset relation to be adequate.
It not only enhances diversity and adapts to different contexts but also allows
the combination of circular with complementary strategies, because it does not
prescribe an intrinsic hierarchy between the Circular Economy and other
sustainability strategies. An example for this are the sustainable business model
archetypes of Bocken et al. (2014). Therefore, we would propose this, as well
as other work exploring the multiple dimensions of sustainable business models
(e.g., Boons et al., 2013; Geissdoerfer et al., 2016a) as a good base for future
research and practice. In this way, environmentally focused approaches to CE,
like the work by Allwood et al., (2012) and Bakker et al. (2014), can be
complemented with concepts that take a more holistic stakeholder view – and
especially social considerations – into account.
6. Conclusions
First, based on key literature, we define the Circular Economy as a regenerative
system in which resource input and waste, emission, and energy leakage are
minimised by slowing, closing, and narrowing material and energy loops. This
can be achieved through long-lasting design, maintenance, repair, reuse,
remanufacturing, refurbishing, and recycling. Second, we define sustainability
as the balanced integration of economic performance, social inclusiveness, and
environmental resilience, to the benefit of current and future generations.
We found that the Circular Economy is an emerging topic that has attracted
increasing research interest. While the roots of the topic are European, much of
this recent surge started with Chinese authors after the implementation of
regulatory controls in this country. Chinese and European scholars have in
particular have taken up this topic and there is an exponential growth in
publications. This could reflect the increased interest from companies and
policymakers in these regions.
To answer the first research question - What are the main conceptual
similarities and differences between sustainability and the Circular Economy? -
this paper summarises the main similarities and differences between
sustainability and the circular economy. Despite often being used in similar
contexts, the similarities and differences between these concepts have not
been made explicit in the literature, therefore blurring their conceptual contours
and constraining the efficacy of their use. We believe that by shedding light on
their differences, this paper contributes not only to conceptual development, but
also serves to better reveal the interests, motivations and practical implications
of their use in the public and private sectors.
Furthermore, the paper addressed the second research question - How is the
Circular Economy conceptually related to sustainability? We found that the
Circular Economy is viewed as a condition for sustainability, a beneficial
relation, or a trade-off in literature. This can be broken down into eight different
relationships. Based on the investigated literature, this paper argues that the
subset relationship seems to be appropriate to maintain diversity while,
concomitantly, shedding light on the wide range of complementary strategies
that managers and policymakers can adopt.
The most relevant limitations of this work derive from the methodologies
employed for our literature review. Bibliometric analysis assumes that
researchers publish their most important findings in journals and base their
research on previously published articles (Fetscherin and Usunier, 2012). This
paper used bibliometric tools for meta-analysis to cover the differences,
similarities and interrelationship of the Circular Economy and sustainability by
unravelling the evolution of these fields and the most relevant academic
sources of research that would be initially sampled for literature review.
However, contributions might arise from unpublished documents, as well as
reports and other documents that are not published in academic journals.
Moreover, bibliometric analysis was followed by semi-structured snowballing to
capture emerging conceptual trends. The central limitation of this
methodological step consists of the lack of randomised representativeness,
resulting in selection bias. These limitations can be overcome by further
research, using different methodological techniques to not only test the validity
of these results, but also to clarify the contexts in which they might not be
applicable.
Finally, there is a wide range of opportunities for future research in this area, of
which we believe two are particularly critical to the advancement of literature.
We would first encourage research about how the investigated relationship is
seen by a wider range of companies and by policy makers, which can then be
contrasted with the results presented in this article. Moreover, the linkage
between Circular Economy and emerging concepts such as the Performance
Economy (Stahel, 2010), Sharing Economy, and new business forms such as
benefit corporations could be investigated (Bocken et al., 2014). Importantly,
the actual impacts of Circular Economy initiatives need to be analysed – how do
these perform against the triple bottom line (Elkington, 1997) and contribute to
‘strong sustainability’ and slower forms of consumption, i.e., closing as well as
slowing resource loops (Bocken et al., 2016)? Lastly, it is critical to investigate
the influence of a better understanding of the relationship between the Circular
Economy and sustainability and their influences over the performance of supply
chains, business models, and innovation systems.

Johnson & Johnson is a holding company, which engages in the research and development, manufacture and sale of products in the health care field. It operates through the following segments: Consumer, Pharmaceutical, and Medical Devices.
By partnering with our suppliers, we can strengthen the social, environmental and economic performance of our supply chain, reducing our collective footprints and strengthening our companies as well. EcoVadis helps us to map our supplier conformance to J&J Responsibility Standards.
Nestlé SA is a nutrition, health and wellness company, which engages in the manufacture, supply and production of prepared dishes and cooking aids, milk-based products, pharmaceuticals and ophthalmic goods, baby foods and cereals.
We have found EcoVadis to be extremely efficient and useful to manage most of our service and indirect materials suppliers. Through EcoVadis we are able to get a deep understanding of our suppliers' practices.
Aligned with Nestlé Responsible Sourcing, EcoVadis gives suppliers a unique way to demonstrate their sustainability performance by building on what they already have.
For buying organizations such as Nestlé, the EcoVadis platform is one of the tools we use to avoid duplication and to ensure effective collaboration on responsible sourcing with our strategic suppliers.
Centrica plc is a British multinational energy and services company with its headquarters in Windsor, Berkshire. Its principal activity is the supply of electricity and gas to businesses and consumers in the United Kingdom, Ireland and North America.
EcoVadis has enabled us to take our responsible procurement program to the next step. We especially appreciate its engagement with suppliers in multiple languages and regions. The ratings and benchmarking make it easy for our procurement teams to make decisions and to maintain and improve performance.
LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE is a luxury goods company. Its business activities are divided into various business groups, including Wines & Spirits, Fashion & Leather Goods, Perfumes & Cosmetics, Watches & Jewelry, Selective retailing and Other activities.
New regulations can be helpful because until recently sustainability was something that each LVMH House had to approach on its own. Now, with Sapin II and ""Devoir de vigilance"" (Duty of Care) regulations, especially in France, the group as a whole is also responsible for what happens at the subsidiary level. This means we need to create more links between what can be done at House level, the business line level, or at the group level. It also strengthens all the synergies we want to create between our subsidiaries. This is a very positive thing for us. The advice I would give about using EcoVadis is that it can help you to make a quick and fairly accurate mapping of the suppliers who are at risk
Founded in 1876, Henkel operates worldwide in three business areas: Adhesive Technologies, Beauty Care and Laundry & Home Care.
The company holds leading positions in both industrial and consumer businesses thanks to brands, innovations and technologies such as Persil, Schwarzkopf and Loctite.
Besides the metrics, EcoVadis provides a point of entry for discussion with our suppliers, enabling dialogue about innovation. These can potentially result in joint opportunities, creating a competitive advantage for Henkel or simply securing supply.

We have more than 70.000 suppliers, and I'm just talking about tier one. Knowing this very large scope, I need people around me to help me drive my action plans.
Atos is a French multinational information technology (IT) service and consulting company headquartered in Bezons, France and offices worldwide. It specialises in hi-tech transactional services, unified communications, cloud, big data and cybersecurity services.
We at procurement have to help our sales organization with bids to our customers or clients or potential clients. Certainly, we've seen recently that more clients are asking for a sustainability criteria or even an EcoVadis score within the bid package that we're putting back. In the UK, we won a public sector bid. The difference was the fact that we had a CSR score and a sustainability program that we could reference and that they recognized.
Group PSA is a French multinational manufacturer of automobiles and motorcycles sold under the Peugeot, Citroën, DS, Opel and Vauxhall brands.
It starts with the strategy we ask every buyer and every commodity to have. When they have a strategy, every supplier who are part of it must already have a CSR rating. This means that before any call for tenders is launched, CSR is part of it. And then, of course, we keep in mind that when each buyer presents something to the whole group, they want to make a call for tenders, CSR must be in order.
If you look at our vehicles, more than 90% of what they are made of is purchased....This is why we are working in the purchasing department to ensure that all the vehicles on the street are produced in a sustainable way. Here we really have a very big job to do. There’s also something for us in it, it's a pleasure to do that and we really feel empowered to do it to really drive the industry in that. I think this is a natural thing to do.
Founded in 1933, Air France is a founding Member of SkyTeam. Air France is always pursuing an ongoing policy focused on quality and innovation. Tailoring products and services to customers’ expectations is one of the most important challenges of Air France. Our efforts have led to major overhauls, such as the introduction of the New Travel Concept on long-haul flights, in particular with the new cabin layout in La Première (First Class), Affaires (Business Class), Premium Voyageur (Premium Economy) and Voyageur (Economy) cabins, along with significant changes to medium-haul flights.
We chose EcoVadis because we believe that we should work with subject matter experts, because we do not have the resources in-house and because EcoVadis has made it possible for us to have a procedure, a network of suppliers and a structured method for the evaluation of suppliers. It fully meets our needs and I think it can meet the needs of many companies.
Founded in 1964, Cascades offers sustainable, innovative and value-added packaging, hygiene and recovery solutions. Cascades provides innovative products that customers have come to rely on, while contributing to the well-being of people, communities and the entire planet.
In 2012, all the evaluations were conducted in-house and our sustainable development team looked at several companies that could support us. EcoVadis was the most advanced among them and the one we decided to go for. And last year, when it was time to renew our contract, we looked again at what's available in the market and decided to continue with EcoVadis. One of the things we really appreciate is the support we receive from the experts who work with us to help us improve.
Belron International Ltd. is the world’s leading provider of vehicle glass repair and replacement (VGRR) services. The company operates a network of thousands of glass replacement service centers, backed by a mobile repair fleet.
For me, as a CSR director, it is very important to have this kind of tool to engage people in the strategy. We send the score to the partners that ask us to be evaluated by EcoVadis, and we also give this score to the other partners who have not asked us to be evaluated. This gives us an external approval, external approach of what we do, and this is something very important.
We adopted the EcoVadis platform because it was one of the longest established assessment platforms with a good robust approach to assessing and reviewing performance in the sustainability area. Also, we had one of our key clients who was requiring us to complete it as a supplier, and this basically gave us a really good synergy to adopt a program, which not only was satisfying our clients, but which also was helping us internally to drive sustainable thinking and embedding a sustainable approach to business within each of our organizations. The thing that we really like about the EcoVadis platform is a template which each of our businesses can adopt and can use to help them for their own purposes, for their own priorities within their particular country, within their particular market and it gives them their own local ownership.
Atlinks is principally engaged in home and office telecommunication product designing. Their customers include large consumers retail chain stores, telecom operators and distributors mainly located in Europe and Latin America.
Back in 2012, one first-tier telecom operator customer requested us to fill in the questionnaire as a supplier and then a second one. We soon saw the benefits of joining the EcoVadis program. It is a very well-known platform for CSR evaluation and other customers were also asking to see our assessment. Plus the fact that we got good results encouraged us to communicate this more widely to our customers.
Sustainability assessments are now part of our management system and are planned at the end of the yearly cycle of activities, programs, training, audits, awareness and reviews. This has also proved very useful for our IPO because the Hong Kong Exchange market is very demanding when it comes to sustainability. We had a number of initiatives in place before but EcoVadis helped us structure them and create value for our customers.
AXA is a French multinational insurance firm headquartered in the 8th arrondissement of Paris that engages in global insurance, investment management, and other financial services.
The benefit of working with EcoVadis is their expertise and their support to train our procurement colleagues and helping us to redefined our processes to understand the risks and proactively address them.
The Beckers Group is a global coatings company that is focused on developing high-quality environmentally compatible paint systems. With expertise based on their long history dating back over 150 years, Beckers today provides solutions to customers in 60 countries.

Ciena is a networking systems, services and software company. They provide solutions that help their clients create the Adaptive NetworkTM in response to the constantly changing demands of their users.
The scorecard feedback is relatively easy to use and understand and includes integrated corrective actions. The format highlights focus areas which is helpful when talking with buyers about a supplier’s performance.
Clariant AG is a Swiss speciality chemicals company, formed in 1995 as a spin-off from Sandoz. The company is focused on four business areas: care chemicals (consumer and industrial); catalysis; natural resources (oil & mining, minerals); and plastics & coatings.
The key advantages and benefits of the EcoVadis methodology are that it is extremely flexible, so it can adapt to the supplier profile across industries, geographies and sizes. Additionally, it not only provides a score, but it provides a basis for suppliers to drive an improvement program. The suppliers are therefore able to show us and themselves how much they have improved in terms of sustainability performance.
Coca-Cola Amatil Limited (CCA) is one of the largest bottlers of non-alcoholic ready-to-drink beverages in the Asia-Pacific region and one of the world’s five major Coca-Cola bottlers.
Sustainable procurement for us started in the 'Protect' area, where we are all about risk management and brand reputation, making sure our suppliers are doing the right thing. A rigorous internal communication and engagement plan was developed in order to gain support and incorporate feedback prior the program launch.
EA is a 100% employee-owned public benefit corporation that provides environmental, compliance, natural resources, and infrastructure engineering and management solutions to a wide range of public and private sector clients.
It was in great interest to us as an organization to have EcoVadis come in and look at exactly what we are doing to give us some opportunities to learn what we can improve upon, as well as what we are doing well and maybe create opportunities to enhance those aspects of our program.
Firmenich SA is a private Swiss company in the fragrance and flavor business. It is the largest privately owned company in the field and ranks number two worldwide. Firmenich has created perfumes for over 100 years and produced a number of well-known scents.
EcoVadis has become a strategic tool for us and a way to structure what we do. And also a way to engage our teams. From a business point of view, a lot of our clients who know EcoVadis ask for EcoVadis Rating. It certainly helps create a common ground with our clients as well. I think we are looking forward in the future to do the same with our suppliers and to create this very interesting positive chain, from brands all the way down to farmers or suppliers in our other fields.
ManpowerGroup is the world leader in innovative workforce solutions, connecting human potential to the power of business. ManpowerGroup serves both large and small organizations across all industry sectors through our brands and offerings: ManpowerGroup Solutions, Experis, Manpower and Right Management.
We use the EcoVadis assessment as our common standard to educate local teams about global client expectations, discover areas of potential risk, and identify good practices to share across the organization.
UPM products include pulp, paper, plywood, sawn timber, labels and composites, bioenergy, biofuels for transport, biochemicals and nano products. The company is the world’s leading producer of graphic papers and second-largest producer of self-adhesive label materials.
UPM has a rather large supply base. We have over 25,000 suppliers, and we source a lot of different raw materials. For us, it's crucial to know where the risks are. We need tools that help us decide where to focus our actions.
Verescence is the world leader in glass bottle manufacturing for the Perfumery and Cosmetics Industry and has been supplying the biggest brands with glass for over 120 years.
We were evaluated EcoVadis for several years due to our customers' request. Three years ago, we took the decision at the executive committee level to choose Ecovadis as the internal reference for our sustainability initiatives. That allowed us to structure our CSR system because the EcoVadis reference framework covers all of the CSR issues and, on the other hand, it also allowed us to align the different subsidiaries with the group's strategy and ensure that the deployment of this strategy was both measurable and aligned with the group's strategies. .

astrazeneca,https://www.astrazeneca.com/sustainability.html ,"Our sustainability ambition
To use our capabilities to make the most meaningful impact where society needs it - health
At AstraZeneca we’re united by our desire to push the boundaries of science to deliver life-changing medicines.
We are committed to operating in a way that recognises the interconnection between business growth, the needs of society and the limitations of our planet. Our sustainability priorities in Access to healthcare, Environmental protection, and Ethics and transparency support the delivery of our business strategy.
How do we approach sustainability at AstraZeneca?
Sustainability at AstraZeneca is about using our capabilities to make the most meaningful impact where society needs it — health. We work to integrate sustainability into every aspect of our enterprise to help future-proof our business to be resilient in challenging times, helping ensure we can continue to deliver life-changing medicines to patients.
Our sustainability strategy is guided by a materiality assessment. This process determines the topics that are most important to AstraZeneca and our stakeholders, giving us the opportunity to achieve the most positive impact. We have 16 material focus areas, which are grouped under three interconnected priorities — Access to healthcare, Environmental protection and Ethics and transparency.
Our three sustainability priorities
Access to healthcare
Access to healthcare at AstraZeneca goes beyond our medicines. We provide healthcare solutions along a continuum of care — from prevention, awareness, diagnosis and treatment, to post-treatment and wellness. We work across our main therapy areas to address unmet medical needs and health disparities.
Environmental protection
Climate change is now a climate crisis. It is impacting human health and the biosphere in increasingly severe ways. We are taking bold action on climate because we recognise the strong connection between a healthy planet and healthy people.
Ethics and transparency
We want to be valued for not only our medicines, but also for the way we work. We aim to build trust by demonstrating integrity, transparency and fair treatment in everything that we do. We have committed to equity in the delivery of healthcare. This includes ensuring equity in our workplace, access to our medicines, in our clinical trials and beyond.

The Ross Concentration in Business and Sustainability (BaS) is designed for MBA students interested in this fast-growing field.
The concentration complements the MBA curriculum with sustainability electives to help you consider the sustainability “triple bottom line”: environmental protection, social well-being, and economic performance. Available courses cover topics like climate change, food security, energy, water, the built environment, manufacturing, materials, and social impact.
In the concentration, you will take 12 credits of coursework — six credits from foundational courses (Table 1) and six credits from general electives (Table 2). At least six of the 12 credits must be taken within Ross and at least three credits outside of Ross. The concentration will be completed within the 57 credits required for your MBA. The concentration may be added in your first year.
The BaS is distinct from the Erb Institute dual degree, which offers a deeper dive in issues related to sustainability. Students opting for the dual-degree earn both an MBA from Michigan Ross and an MS from the School for Environment and Sustainability in as little as one additional semester. The Erb Institute — one of the world’s leading dual-degree programs — offers coursework, co-curricular learning, and a global alumni network in support of those seeking careers in business sustainability. Erb dual-degree students are not eligible for the BaS.

daka,https://www.daka.dk/en/sustainability/ ,"All of the business areas in Daka Denmark have safe, sustainable and productive management of natural resources as a focal point. For almost 100 years, Daka Denmark has been guarantor for safe handling, but also sustainable recycling and recycling of by-products from agriculture and the food industry.
The future must be based on sustainability
In 2021, Daka Denmark has published its first sustainability report. It is based on a life cycle analysis of all Daka Denmark's business areas. Analysis of Daka Denmark's total activities in 2019 resulted in a net saving of 277,000 tonnes of C02eq. This is possible, as Daka Denmark provides a service of utilizing raw materials which are described as waste and which cannot be used for anything else. For raw materials, received in the form of by-products from slaughterhouses, dead animals from agriculture and food waste from private households, restaurants, supermarkets and the food industry, the CO2 footprint is thus set at zero. This calculation method is defined in accordance with the ISO 14044 standard and the international LEAP cooperation, where the CO2 footprint for production animals is attributed to the meat industry.
To structure our different action fields, we use the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the 2030 Agenda, adopted by the United Nations in 2015, as orientation. The 17 goals with 169 targets are intended to serve as a guide for countries and companies around the world to create a sustainable and equitable world and to preserve natural resources in the long term.
Our responsibility and commitment to the health and safety of our people is expressed in one of our core Business Principles: “Health and safety is non-negotiable in everything we do.” As a company, SARIA is responsible for ensuring a safe working environment for our employees and partners, and we all work to achieve and improve this every day.
In recent years, a number of important developments have been initiated in this area. For example, a regular group safety meeting was established with safety experts from our different countries and business units to share experiences and good practices, learn from each other and jointly develop group safety standards. One example is the SARIA Fire Safety Guideline, developed by this Safety Group based on their group-wide technical expertise and broad operational experience. The guideline was adopted by the executive board as a common standard for fire protection that sets out minimum requirements and provides additional guidance for all locations.
Further, a regular monitoring of central H&S KPIs in the executive board meetings ensures the necessary focus on the topic of occupational health and safety.
In addition to the development of occupational safety concepts to protect employees, preventive health care is also very important for us. In many countries various offers are available to our employees, such as discounts for gyms, company bicycle leasing, personal accident insurance, and much more.
SARIA helps to improve the health and well-being of people, animals and plants by offering various products specifically designed for these applications (physical health). One example is our Bioiberica business unit: as the manufacturer of one in five doses of the anticoagulant drug heparin administered worldwide, Bioiberica is a key partner to the pharmaceutical industry. Compliance with the strict statutory requirements in this sector around quality, safety and traceability is facilitated by close collaboration with SARIA division Van Hessen, which supplies the necessary raw material. In addition to pesticides and active agents that support human health, Bioiberica contributes to the well-being and performance of pets and livestock by providing various dietary supplements and feed additives that are solely bio-based. A very different example is our SecAnim business, which contributes to healthy living by preventing disease through the hygienic collection of fallen animals in compliance with regulatory requirements.
High safety and hygiene standards enable the safe collection and processing of animal by-products and ensure the safety of our products. In this way, we protect our employees and other persons who come into contact with the company or its products from personal injury or health hazards. In addition, we offer our partners legal certainty by guaranteeing full compliance with all relevant legal and regulatory requirements for the collection and disposal of organic material.

businessfinland,https://www.businessfinland.fi/en/do-business-with-finland/visit-finland/sustainable-travel-finland-label ,"In order for the tourism industry to respond to the changing demand and continue to grow, the development must be sustainable. To help the tourism industry in Finland to adopt sustainable practices, Visit Finland has developed the Sustainable Travel Finland -programme, designed for tourism companies and destinations in Finland.
It's time to act! Climate change is the biggest of the world's current environmental threats, and in the Arctic region, the climate is warming double the speed comparing to the rest of the world. We consume natural resources much faster than these are generated. The role of tourism as part of the global economy is growing. Climate change is already affecting the tourist flows. The most sensitive to climate change are many of Finland’s outdoor travel products that depend on climate. Mitigation requires proactive tourism planning and management at national and regional level. It is time to act now!
For the third year in a row, Finland has been named the happiest country in the world according to the 2020 World Happiness Report, and we Finns largely attribute our happiness to our connection to nature. Our lakes, rivers and forests not only feed us in Finland, but also provide with natural wellbeing and a place to slow down. Therefore, Visit Finland’s approach to sustainability is to nurture, conserve and preserve what is most important – the pure and pristine nature, the lifestyle that is so strongly rooted in it, and our culture that celebrates equality. Elements such as equality, integrity, safety, social progression and freedom are the cornerstones of Finnish society.
Perhaps it comes as no surprise that the survey among tourism actors in Finland, carried out by Visit Finland in Autumn 2018, revealed that 83% of the respondents supported the idea of a national sustainable tourism programme.
However, the will for sustainability does not come only from inside the tourism industry, but a set of national strategies opt for a sustainable Finland. New government in Finland was elected in Spring 2019, and the Programme of Government, submitted in June 2019, is ‘Inclusive and competent Finland – a socially, economically and ecologically sustainable society’. Finland's Arctic Strategy, driving sustainable development in the Arctic, has set sustainable tourism as one of its priorities. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment, responsible for Finland’s updated tourism strategy for 2019-2028, has identified four priorities that will facilitate the sustainable growth and renewal of the tourism sector in Finland - first priority being supporting sustainable development.
With focus on all dimensions of sustainability (ecological, cultural, social and economic), Sustainable Travel Finland programme offers Finnish tourism industry a complete toolkit to put these strategies into action.
The idea of Sustainable Travel Finland programme is to provide companies and destinations with a sustainable development path; a concrete toolkit for sustainable tourism that makes it easier to adopt sustainable practices and choices in the everyday business. Companies and destinations that undergo the entire programme are recognised with the Sustainable Travel Finland label and will have access to a continuous development model, the latest information on sustainable tourism development, and marketing support and visibility on Visit Finland channels.
Although Sustainable Travel Finland programme aligns with internationally known sustainable tourism programmes and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), it is built for regional and national development needs. Initially, the current state and development needs were surveyed, and the following areas for development needs recognised: commitment, knowhow, planning, communication, auditing and measuring. Instead of adopting a foreign model to Finland, a national model was designed to address these needs, as well as regional differences.
To lower the threshold to apply for the Sustainable Travel Finland programme and the development path it provides, an educational concept facilitated by Visit Finland Academy has been created to bring the entire destination and its tourism operators together to start the journey towards Sustainable Travel Finland label.
While for the international travel trade the Sustainable Travel Finland label provides an easy way to identify a sustainable tourism provider or a destination, for the tourism industry in Finland it provides a 7-step sustainable tourism development path. This 7-step programme is traversed on online platform specifically built for the purpose. The platform is supported with an ‘e-guide’ e-learning environment, accessible only by those accepted to Sustainable Travel Finland programme.
Step 1. Commitment
• Making a formal decision to develop sustainable tourism, which for destination includes a commitment from both public sector and regional tourism company network
• Signing national sustainable tourism principles
• Appointing a coordinator for sustainable tourism
Step 2. Increasing know-how
• Familiarising with the Sustainable Travel Finland e-guide
• Participating in Visit Finland Academy's Sustainable Travel Finland workshop
• Making an online-based self-assessment.
Step 3. Development plan
• Drawing up a sustainable tourism development plan with short and long terms goals and plan of action
Step 4. Responsible communication
• Communicating the acts towards sustainability transparently to the public
Step 5. Certification & Auditing
• Obtaining a regularly audited certificate, accepted under Sustainable Travel Finland label, that supports sustainable development
• For a destination to become a Sustainable Travel Finland –destination, 51% of the tourism companies (including the ones with highest turnover) within the destination must have Sustainable Travel Finland –label.
Step 6. Verification and measurability
• Verifying that sustainable tourism has been practised for over a year
• Committing to national sustainable tourism indicators (more details on STIs will be published later in 2020)
Step 7. Agreement & Continuous development
• Making an agreement with Business Finland / Visit Finland on the use of the Sustainable Travel Finland label
• Commitment to regularly renewing Sustainable Travel Finland label, including auditing, and updated self-assessment, development plan and sustainable tourism indicators.

sustain,https://sustain.org/about/what-is-a-sustainable-community/ ,"What is a Sustainable Community?
Throughout the world, people want the same things: access to clean air and water; economic opportunities; a safe and healthy place to raise their kids; shelter; lifelong learning; a sense of community; and the ability to have a say in the decisions that affect their lives.
A sustainable community takes into account, and addresses, multiple human needs, not just one at the exclusion of all others. It is a place where people of diverse backgrounds and perspectives feel welcome and safe, where every group has a seat at the decision-making table, and where prosperity is shared.
It takes a long-term perspective – focusing on anticipating and adapting to change in both the present and future.
A sustainable community manages its human, natural, and financial capital to meet current needs while ensuring that adequate resources are available for future generations.
Since 1991, ISC has worked with thousands of communities, organizations, institutions and companies in more than 30 countries. We believe strong communities are the foundation of a peaceful and healthy planet for humanity. We have concluded that climate change, income inequality, and social injustice are the biggest threats to building strong, sustainable communities and hence these challenges define our current priorities.
ISC’s mission is to help communities around the world address environmental, economic and social challenges to build a better future shaped and shared by all.
Elements of a Sustainable Community
ISC developed the following elements of a sustainable community in 1995 (which were adopted by the President’s Commission on Sustainable Development in 1997):

daily business.
daily business.
Our approach to sustainability covers three areas: the people, the business and the environment. In short, this means we care for the environment, practice sound business ethics and look after our employees. It is as deep-rooted in our culture and people as it is in the way we design, manufacture and innovate.
A fuller life for everyone
Our focus is to design and manufacture products with energy efficiency in mind that impact the environment as little as possible during their lifecycle. And of course, we also provide safe workplaces and ensure that our sub-contractors follow local legislation and regulations.
Ultimately, it’s about contributing to a better environment through intelligent lighting solutions. This means that everyone who is working, shopping, picking up their children, recuperating, taking care of others, walking, manufacturing, teaching or studying can use every moment of their day to the fullest.
Sustainable value creation
Offering increasingly energy-efficient luminaires and lighting solutions is Fagerhult Group’s greatest contribution to the development of sustainable living. In addition, the materials used have a large impact, all the way from extraction and manufacturing to recycling. Our focus is therefore to harness innovation in order to increase the proportion of sustainable materials.
The lighting solutions are also developed using expertise and insight into the positive impact of light on people in a variety of environments and situations. At the Group level, sustainability is a top priority and a natural part of our daily work, as well as a condition for our continued success in the lighting market.
UN’s sustainability goals show the way
From the UN’s 17 Sustainable Development Goals, we have identified four where Fagerhult Group can have the most impact as well as the greatest opportunity to make a positive contribution.
During 2020, we will further clarify our ambition and set targets at Group level. Our goal is to create concrete, measurable and far-reaching targets for the next five-year period.

Our approach to sustainability
We have chosen to group our most important sustainability topics into three areas: Environment, People and Business.
We consider these areas to be the most important for the Group to address.
Business
Fagerhult Group works comprehensively to ensure ethical, sustainable business in all areas of its operations. The guiding document is the Group’s Code of Conduct (see below), which includes the underlying principles for how to conduct responsible business. Everyone within the Group, from the Board of Directors and management to individual employees must follow this.
When acquiring a company, we follow a stringent and detailed due diligence process, tailored to the specific business acquisition. Depending on the type of operations or the business set-up, the process is tailored to the specific situation and company. Areas always covered in our due diligences are: commercial, financial, legal and senior management.
Key topics
- Ethics and anti-corruption
- Human rights
- Partner collaboration
- Supplier reviews
- Due diligence processes
Objectives
- All companies and partners conduct business according to current laws and regulations.
- Our shared Code of Conduct forms the basis for everything we do and how we act.
- Ensure a sustainable supply chain, making sure all suppliers meet our requirements.
- Thorough due diligence is conducted for every company acquisition.
Environment
Fagerhult Group converted to LED technology early, which means that all our luminaires today are based on LED technology. This change has led to significant energy savings, but there is more to be gained. Smart lighting control systems can further increase savings and at the same time improve the end-user experience. Proximity sensor-controlled lighting has shown energy savings of up to 70%.
In addition, we continuously invest in product development and manufacturing. This allows us to increase the use of renewable materials and minimize the resources used in manufacturing. We also follow up with lifecycle analyses to understand our products’ impact during production, installation, usage and recycling.
Key topics
- Lifecycle perspective
- Energy-efficient solutions
- Conscious material selection
- Use of resources, water, energy, etc.
- Carbon emission
- Internal environmental work
Objectives
- Maximize energy savings, using the latest LED technology and smart lighting control.
- Ensure that all products and services fulfill applicable regulations and standards.
- Lifecycle perspective on our solutions to minimize our environmental impact.
- Environmental consideration throughout our full value chain, internally and externally.
People
Fagerhult Group’s goal for the workplace is characterized by participation, commitment and well-being, a perfect environment for every employee to develop. We seek to develop leaders internally and provide opportunities for people to grow. This is what we call sustainable leadership, always aiming to make the most of people’s differences and skills.
We also strive to offer a workplace where the local and the global are intertwined. Our Group values, which should be present in all processes and daily routines, unite and guide our employees, and support collaboration between Group companies.
Key topics
- Work conditions
- Equality and diversity
- Career development
- Occupational health and safety
- Product responsibility/safe products
Objectives
- Guarantee our employees’ health, safety and human rights.
- Sustainable leadership development, finding new opportunities for valuable people
- Ensure our Group values are an integral part of all processes and daily work.
- Facilitate a constructive dialogue and collaboration between Group companies.
Our business model and value creation
Our business model is based on thirteen Group brands and encourages local decision-making and execution. All of our brands have a strong reputation, either globally or locally, and operate with their own product development, manufacturing and go-to-market models.
At Group level we support selected central functions and set the governance principles for the Group. We have recently decided to work on our Connectivity development at Group level to ensure we create a competitive advantage for all of our brands and make it simple for our customers to work with us and use our solutions.

Our global presence demands that our employees and business partners take responsibility – for themselves and others. We have created a set of rules, our Code of Conduct. Everyone in our Group is obligated to follow it.
We also pass the code on to our business partners and expect them to adopt the Code of Conduct and follow it themselves. In 2019, we conducted a group wide code of conduct training. This will be repeated every second year. The training is also part of the introduction program for all new employees. Download
Reporting concerns
Fagerhult Group promotes openness and transparency in all of our activities. We encourage all our employees and business partners to report any violations of Fagerhult Group’s Code of Conduct and other policies and regulations.
If you would like advice on any matter or wish to report a concern you can send an email to: ethics@fagerhultgroup.com. We will handle all reported concerns confidentially. You can report in your preferred language and, if you find it necessary, also anonymously.

Now, more than ever, responsible, sustainable travel is vital in bringing cultures back together and supporting those communities that depend on tourism.
Research shows that travellers want to take meaningful trips with a positive impact – they just don't always know how. That's why at Booking.com, we aim to make sustainable travel easier for everyone.
Our mission
As a leader in travel, we believe it is our responsibility, and that of our industry, to help make sure this planet, its people, wildlife and habitats are able to thrive now and long into the future. So we're working with our partners to provide a wider array of sustainable experiences, to give customers more sustainable choices when they travel. We're also looking at how we can reduce the overall footprint of our company and offices around the world, while exploring new ways to make ourselves more efficient and become carbon neutral in our operations.
Our Vision
The world is changing and so is our industry. But what hasn't changed is our commitment to preserving a world worth experiencing. We believe now is the time to embrace change and use this moment to make it possible for people everywhere to travel more sustainably, when it is safe to do so. We are committed to reducing our energy consumption, and will be offsetting our operational carbon emissions in 2020 and beyond. We have also implemented waste-streaming and plastics-reduction measures in offices across the globe. We are working with partners to collect information about sustainability at their properties and educate them on how to improve their own efficiency when it comes to energy and waste. And we will continue to challenge ourselves and our industry to become more sustainable.
Developing our product
According to research conducted by Booking.com in 2020 (~ 22 global markets and ~1000 participants per market) 82% of travellers tell us they find sustainability an important topic, but only 50% tell us there's enough choice when it comes to places to stay and 38% are not even sure where to look for sustainable accommodation. This is a problem – one we can fix through our partners and our product. That's why in 2020 we also began collecting information about the sustainability activities of our partners, and so far hundreds of thousands of properties have shared this information with us. This data, alongside a detailed framework, has helped us begin experimenting with our product to make it easier for more of our customers to choose sustainable places to stay.
Protecting wildlife
At Booking.com, we believe in the conservation of native and natural biodiversity, habitats and wildlife, as well as the prevention of animal exploitation. In 2019, we set about developing welfare guidelines in close consultation with World Animal Protection – a leading international NGO moving the world to protect animals for more than 50 years. To do this successfully, we conducted a thorough business impact assessment and developed a business integrity process that would enable us to work with any partners identified as potentially breaching our guidelines. Alongside these guidelines, we have implemented changes that stop the promotion of activities, such as swimming with dolphins and riding elephants, on our products. In 2019, Booking.com also joined the The Coalition for Ethical Wildlife Tourism, an alliance of committed travel industry leaders from across the globe working to end cruel wildlife entertainment.
Industry collaboration
In 2019, with a common goal of developing industry-wide solutions to make sustainable travel easier for everyone and protect the destinations we love to explore, we joined Travalyst as a founding partner, alongside the Duke of Sussex and other leading global brands. We are an official partner of World Animal Protection, making us part of an alliance of global travel leaders committed to ending cruelty in wildlife entertainment. In 2020, we worked with the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) and UN World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO) to help educate our partners on reducing single-use plastics while maintaining safety during the pandemic. We also continue to work closely with the Sustainable Hospitality Alliance.
Emergency Response
Natural disasters can have a truly devastating impact on communities and destinations. We began our emergency response fund to help support the relief organisations that deliver vital aid to the people and places hit by these catastrophes. To raise funds quickly and efficiently, we set up an internal fundraising campaign, so employees can donate immediately, with the company matching all their contributions. Since 2015, Booking.com and its employees have donated more than €400,000 to organisations delivering immediate relief to those in need across the globe. .

Also, in this content we may refer to Shell’s “Net Carbon Footprint”, which includes Shell’s carbon emissions from the production of our energy products, our suppliers’ carbon emissions in supplying energy for that production and our customers’ carbon emissions associated with their use of the energy products we sell. Shell only controls its own emissions. The use of the term Shell’s “Net Carbon Footprint” is for convenience only and not intended to suggest these emissions are those of Shell or its subsidiaries. Shell’s operating plan, outlook and budgets are forecasted for a ten-year period and are updated every year. They reflect the current economic environment and what we can reasonably expect to see over the next ten years. Accordingly, Shell’s operating plans, outlooks, budgets and pricing assumptions do not reflect our net-zero emissions target. In the future, as society moves towards net-zero emissions, we expect Shell’s operating plans, outlooks, budgets and pricing assumptions to reflect this movement.
The UN’s 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) seek to address the world’s biggest challenges. We welcome the SDGs and aim to play our part in helping governments and societies to achieve them.
Our comprehensive set of codes, policies and assurance processes define how we aim to operate in socially and environmentally responsible ways.
Shell works with environmental and developmental organisations all over the world. This helps us to reduce our environmental and societal impact, to improve the quality of land and water around our operations and to benefit local communities.
Shell's target is to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050.
Shell’s energy access business is focused on finding commercial ways to help tackle energy poverty. Our ambition is to provide a reliable electricity supply to 100 million people, primarily in Africa and Asia, by 2030.

harvard,https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/sustainability/ ,"Sustainability is a multifaceted issue, in which the food production system and our diets play a crucial role. Achieving a healthy and sustainable food future is an urgent matter that depends on global collaborative efforts.
What is sustainability, and what does it have to do with food?
“Sustainability” can be hard to define as it can mean different things based on the context in which it’s discussed. However, the concept is much more than a trending buzzword. The most frequently quoted definition was put forth by the U.N.’s Brundtland Commission on sustainable development in 1987: “Sustainable development [meets] the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.” [1]
Jeffrey D. Sachs, an expert on sustainable development and director of the Earth Institute at Columbia University, wrote: “Like all living species, humanity depends on nature for food and water, materials for survival, and safety from dire environmental threats, such as epidemics and natural catastrophes. Yet for a species that depends on the beneficence of nature, or on what the scientists call ‘environmental services,’ we are doing a poor job of protecting the physical basis of our very survival!” [2]
Indeed, sustainability encompasses the environment, economics, health, nutrition, and other related dimensions. This interconnectedness can be observed in the FAO’s definition of sustainable diets:
Sustainable Diets are those diets with low environmental impacts that contribute to food and nutrition security and to healthy life for present and future generations. Sustainable diets are protective and respectful of biodiversity and ecosystems, culturally acceptable, accessible, economically fair and affordable; nutritionally adequate, safe and healthy; while optimizing natural and human resources. [3]
As we refer to it here, sustainability means the enactment of practices that fulfill the needs of society while protecting the physical basis of our long-term survival, our environment. We cannot have a secure food supply unless that food supply is sustainable.
Why is a sustainable food supply important?
Today, more than three billion people are malnourished and many of our planet’s 7 billion inhabitants eat diets low in quality. At the same time, the world’s population is rapidly expanding, and it is estimated there will be close to 10 billion people on our planet by 2050. [4] When considering sustainable food development, the goal is to ensure a future when this expanded population has both enough food available to eat and access to high quality, nutritious foods.
Thinking about a successful food future must focus on the earth system as a whole, rather than local levels. The “Anthropocene” is a term used to describe the current geological epoch, a time period defined by humanity being the dominating driver of change in atmospheric, geologic, hydrologic, biospheric and other earth systems. In other words, humanity’s influence is at its greatest point in the history of our planet. The term “anthropogenic” is an adjective that denotes “originating in human activity.”
In terms of anthropogenic activities, agriculture is the largest cause of global environmental change. Examples of global environmental change include climate change, deforestation, desertification, and damage to coastal reefs and marine ecosystems.
- Food production:Contributes approximately 30% of global greenhouse gas emissions, and the livestock sector alone represents almost half (14.5%) of these emissions [5, 6]Occupies about 40% of global land [7]Uses 70% of freshwater [8]Is the largest factor threatening species with extinction [9]Causes eutrophication (nutrient overload) and dead zones in lakes and coastal areas [10]Has led to a majority (~60%) of the world fish stocks to be fully fished or overfished (33%) – only 7% are underfished [11]
Such global environmental change increases the risk of irreversible and catastrophic shifts in the Earth system marked by rising human mortality, morbidity, conflict, and food insecurity. [12] Agriculture in its current form is simultaneously a driver of global environmental change and a victim of shifting environmental conditions. [13] Without action, the world risks failing to meet the UN Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Agreement. Simply put: global food systems are not sustainable. We need to rethink how we eat and rethink the way we produce food in the process.
Healthy diets from sustainable food systems
Despite substantial scientific evidence linking diets with human health and environmental sustainability, historically there’s been a lack of globally-agreed upon targets for healthy diets and sustainable food production. However, in 2019, the EAT-Lancet Commission (a group of 37 scientists from 16 countries working in the fields of human health, nutrition, economics, agriculture, political sciences, and environmental sustainability) assessed existing evidence and developed global scientific targets that define a “safe operating space” for food systems. [14] These targets focus on two key areas that apply to all people and the planet:
Target 1: Healthy Diets
Target 2: Sustainable Food Production
A “Great Food Transformation” is necessary
Transitioning to a sustainable food system that can deliver healthy diets for an estimated 10 billion people by 2050 is an unprecedented challenge. However, the Commission emphasizes that “data are both sufficient and strong enough to warrant immediate action, and delay will increase the likelihood of serious, even disastrous, consequences.”
Fortunately, their analysis found this transition would be doable through a combination of substantial dietary shifts toward mostly plant-based dietary patterns, dramatic reductions in food losses and waste, and major improvements in food production practices. Of course, such a “Great Food Transformation” will not happen without widespread, multi-sector, multi-level action guided by scientific targets. To begin this process, the Commission proposes five strategies as general starting points for national, regional, city, and local change:
- Seek international and national commitment to shift toward healthy diets. Transitioning to a planetary health diet will require global consumption of foods such as red meat and sugar to decrease by 50%, while consumption of fruits, nuts, vegetables, and legumes must double. Policies are needed to improve the availability, access, and affordability of healthy foods while disincentivizing the consumption of unhealthy and unsustainable foods.
- Reorient agricultural priorities from producing high quantities of food to producing healthy food. Shift the emphasis in food and agricultural policy from high volumes of a few crops to greater diversity of nutrient-rich crops.
- Sustainably intensify food production to increase high-quality output. Use technology and system innovation to farm existing land with fewer inputs in order to experience better yields, sequester carbon, and conserve existing biodiversity and ecosystem services.
- Strong and coordinated governance of land and oceans. Protect natural ecosystems and biodiversity by collectively acting, at local and global levels, to halt the expansion of agricultural land and harvested marine areas.
- At least halve food losses and waste, in line with UN Sustainable Development Goals. Reduce food loss and waste in food production and consumption phases by 50% using a mix of technological solutions, consumer campaigns, and public policies.
For more information and specifics on these strategies, read the Commission’s full report, Food in the Anthropocene: the EAT-Lancet Commission on healthy diets from sustainable food systems. Or, read the Commission’s briefs for cities, policymakers, farmers, food service professionals, healthcare professionals, and everyone.
WATCH: Creating a sustainable and healthy food future
The bottom line
Achieving a healthy and sustainable food system is an urgent matter that depends on collaborative efforts from governments, the private and public sectors, as well as individuals. Supply and demand work both ways—a shift in the food production landscape depends on a shift in our diets. We must be aware that our food choices ultimately impact more than just ourselves, and primarily plant-based diets are best for both health outcomes and the environment. In the end, what’s good for the planet is good for us too.

For one thing we can state for years to come: We will contribute to a sustainable future in wood.
Moelvens Sustainability Goals
Climate-smart products and solutoins
We are building a sustainable future using wood. This is the reason we agreed to take part in the pilot project to use a renewable material to create renewable energy.
Material use is optimised and waste quantities reduced through resource-efficient design and industrialised production in controlled environments in the factory, on the construction site and during the usage phase.
According to the UN Climate Panel, in order to successfully limit global temperature rises to less than 2 degrees Celsius by 2100, we must bind more carbon than we release. We can do this by “capturing” greenhouse gases from the atmosphere and storing them underground or by practising active forestry and using more wood in construction.
Wood is a renewable and climate-smart material that fits perfectly in both large and small construction projects. Also, the Norwegian and Swedish forests are full of timber. We have decided to build a sustainable future from wood.
Climate-smart energy solutions should of course be built in a climate-friendly material. Moelven Töreboda is now participating in an innovation project, where the goal is to develop a concept for 150 meter high wind turbines with glulam.
Designing interiors with system walls from Moelven Modus is the best environmental choice. You will be working with a building system that is environmentally approved and built on circular economy principles, where the components are designed to be able to be taken apart and reassembled in a new design, thereby reducing the burden on our shared environment. .

Driven by ambitious targets to protect our planet
Guided by ambitious targets, our environmental performance has improved significantly over the last 15 years. These continuous improvement efforts never stop. In 2020, we increased our ambitions further and committed to new 2030 sustainability and science-based climate targets with absolute greenhouse gas emission reductions. Because we want to lead change!
Contributing to the bigger picture
The UN Sustainable Development Goals
In September 2015, the member states of the United Nations adopted the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). They serve as a blueprint for what the global community wants to achieve by the end of this decade to ensure a better future for all. Consisting of 17 goals and 169 specific social, environmental and economic targets, they set the agenda for a sustainable tomorrow.
Like sustainability itself, we see the SDGs not just as a framework to set the right ambitions, but as a chance to unleash innovation and growth. With our innovative products, sustainable operations and commitment to valuing people, we are dedicated to making contributions to the UN SDGs.
While we contribute to all SDGs in some way, there are six that are particularly relevant to our business and where we believe we can have the largest impact.

Balancing the needs of the current generation with the needs of future generations
As the market leader for engineered heavy lifting and transport, we believe we should be at the forefront of sustainability efforts within our industry. At Mammoet we want to operate in a safe, efficient and ethical way, protecting the planet and supporting the communities we work in, while widening the value we offer to our customers.
Across Mammoet many sustainability initiatives have grown up over the years, often starting at a grass roots level. However, we are now taking steps to advance our sustainability performance in a more impactful way, delivering an integrated approach to sustainability across the business. This integrated way of working has been brought together in a roadmap that directs our sustainability efforts to 2030.
Mammoet's roadmap for sustainability provides targets and focus areas - linked to the UN’s sustainable development goals. Through it we aim to create new partnerships with customers, suppliers and communities on joint sustainability initiatives. The approach builds on existing innovations while exploring new opportunities such as alternative fuel sources and circularity in parts and equipment. Furthermore, it embraces Mammoet's programs for health and safety, diversity, ethics and compliance and corporate social responsibility. It aims to add value to these programs without duplicating our existing work.
To guide, drive and measure sustainability, in a way that will increase the impact of our sustainability actions across our global business, we have adopted a sustainability roadmap. Our roadmap outlines key focus areas through to 2030.
As the market leader in engineered heavy lifting and transport, Mammoet is well placed to drive efforts to improve sustainability in our industry. We see sustainability performance as a fundamental element of operating responsibly. We recognize the need to protect the planet and reduce our carbon footprint.

These targets aim to build on global efforts under the UN’s Sustainable Development Goal 9 - Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure.
Sustainable Engagement is about developing and enhancing sustainable and ethical business practices by collaborating and working in partnership with our supply chain, our customers and the communities in which we operate. The roadmap seeks to optimize the impact of responsible activities within our business, coordinating sustainability objectives and initiatives with our stakeholders to maximise their benefits. Through our Sustainable Engagement theme we seek to continue our work with the renewable sector, finding ways to maximize efficiency for customers to make their projects more economically beneficial. We will also be developing joint reporting programs with customers and introducing circular strategies with our parts and equipment supply chain.
The following targets are in place for this theme:
These targets are linked to the UN’s Sustainable Development Goal 17 - Partnerships for the Goals.
Efficient Operations improve our operational performance, maximising the efficient use of resources. This can be applied to every element of our business, from reducing the number of air miles our people and equipment fly, becoming more efficient with energy and water, to reducing waste generation while increasing what we recycle. Efficient Operations means working internally, and also with customers and suppliers, to use resources more sustainably, through sustainable procurement and setting demanding resource efficiency targets.
The targets we have set will drive performance improvements resulting in energy, water, waste and cost savings:
(Compared to 2020 levels)
These targets aim to contribute to the UN’s Sustainable Development Goal 12 - Responsible consumption and production.
Being a Responsible Employer means we conduct business in a fair and ethical way, providing access to economic opportunities and skills for all members of society, including opportunities for disadvantaged communities. As a global organization, we bring training, skills and economic opportunities to the communities in which we operate.

unilever,https://www.unilever.com/planet-and-society/protect-and-regenerate-nature/sustainable-and-regenerative-sourcing/ ,"Sustainable and regenerative sourcing
Average read time: 23 minutes
We're working with farmers and suppliers to drive up social and environmental standards in our supply chain.
The raw materials that make brands loved by billions
Around 2.5 billion people use our products every day – that’s around a third of the people on the planet. We use many different raw materials to make our products – and millions of people play an important role in providing them. Securing a sustainable supply of these materials is fundamental to the future growth of our business and achieving our ambition to deliver positive impact.
Our approach to sustainable and regenerative sourcing
Our approach has four main strands:
- sustainably sourcing to the highest standards from our network of suppliers
- driving change through the continuous improvement of our policies with suppliers
- playing a leading role in the transformation of agricultural sectors relevant to our business
- communicating to consumers about sustainable sourcing through our brands
The Unilever Sustainable Agriculture Code (SAC) (PDF 7.88MB)Opens in new window and the Unilever Regenerative Agriculture Principles (RAPs) (PDF 8.34MB)Opens in new window provide the basis for our sustainable sourcing programme.
The SAC is a collection of best practice principles for farming that hundreds of thousands of farmers have used since 2010 to make their operations more sustainable. But despite years of implementation, the SAC has not been enough for us to solve all the sustainability challenges in our agricultural supply chain – from decline in soil health to biodiversity loss. We recognised a need to go further.
This is why in April 2021 we introduced the Unilever Regenerative Agriculture Principles (RAPS) (PDF 8.34MB)Opens in new window, which provide guidance on how to nourish the soil, capture carbon and restore and regenerate the land. We aim for these to inspire our business, divisions, brands, our suppliers and peers – and form the basis for regenerative programmes for ingredients in our supply chain.
Our Responsible Sourcing Policy
Following our Procurement Framework (PDF 49KB)Opens in new window, every material we purchase is covered by our Responsible Sourcing Policy (PDF 8.25MB)Opens in new window which applies to all suppliers.
The Unilever Responsible Sourcing Policy
Our Responsible Sourcing Policy (RSP) (PDF 8.25MB)Opens in new window embodies our commitment to conduct business with integrity, openness and respect for universal human rights and core labour principles.
The RSP sets mandatory requirements on human and labour rights for suppliers who have a business relationship with Unilever. It sets out our 12 Fundamental Principles and defines the mandatory requirements that suppliers must achieve to do business with Unilever.
Making progress through partnerships
Our partnerships take a range of forms. For example, we’ve worked with a range of stakeholders to help develop internationally-recognised standards and verification systems like the Rainforest Alliance, The Round Table on Responsible Soy and the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO). We also work with farmers and suppliers, and with consumers to stimulate demand for sustainably sourced ingredients.
Wherever possible, we’re seeking to move to have better visibility on the ground, which gives us and our stakeholders added confidence that the crops in our supply chain are sustainably grown.
Sustainable palm oil
The palm oil industry has a number of sustainability challenges that, as founding members of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), we have been working for a number of years to address.
As a major palm oil buyer, we have a key role to play in transforming the industry to stop deforestation, improve transparency and traceability, and support and enable farmers – especially smallholders – to adopt more sustainable practices.
Visit our palm oil section to find out how we are working to make sustainable palm oil commonplace.
Sustainable soy
Our research shows that consumers prefer products made with sustainable oils – so sourcing our oils sustainably can help grow our business as well as reduce our impacts on the environment.
Soy oil is a crucial ingredient in our brands, such as Hellmann’s mayonnaise, enjoyed by consumers the world over.
Most of the soy oil we buy comes from soybeans grown in the US and Brazil. In each region, we work with farmers, NGOs, our suppliers, other agri-businesses and governments. We also aim to contribute to the development of international standards which recognise farmers and suppliers for their efforts to address the big issues associated with soy production, which vary across regions.
In Latin America, for example, unsustainable soy production is associated with habitat loss and deforestation. We’re committed to ensure that our supply chain is deforestation-free by 2023 so this is a major factor in our sourcing decisions.
We source the majority of our soy oil from the US, where soil health and water quality are a particular focus for our farmer programmes. These programmes have supported hundreds of soy farmers to improve soil health, water quality and yields by using regenerative methods such as planting cover crops.
The Round Table on Responsible Soy
We are founding members of the Round Table on Responsible Soy (RTRS). Since 2010, the development of the RTRS standard has enabled farmers to improve their practices and gain accreditation.
Our purchase of some of the first RTRS certificates was an important step towards ensuring a sustainable supply of soy oil.
Sustainable soy in Latin America
Soy cultivation in Latin America is linked to a number of sustainability challenges. So we’ve been collaborating with partners for several years on long-term RTRS projects that encourage better social, environmental and agricultural practices.
Partnerships for sustainable soy
In Brazil, we are part of a collaboration with the Round Table on Responsible Soy (RTRS) and Aliança da Terra, which has helped more than 40 farmers to gain RTRS certification. This collaborative project aims to boost sustainable soy cultivation by supporting growers to adopt better farming practices. Bayer CropScience provides technical services and crop management advice, and Santander provides support for agricultural loans while Yara advises on best use of fertilisers. And we help boost the market for sustainable soy by buying the resulting crop.
Sustainable vegetables
We can’t make our foods without high-quality vegetables and fruits from all over the world. Securing a sustainable supply is a priority for our business.
A worldwide network, supporting world-famous brands
A reliable supply of the best ingredients is essential to the long-term future of food brands that people can trust on taste, nutrition and sustainability.
Vegetables are a priority crop for our business. We buy significant quantities of tomatoes, onions, pumpkins, leeks, green beans, mushrooms, potatoes, celeriac, peas and carrots, as well as herbs such as basil, parsley and chives. Most of the vegetables we buy are used in the soups, sauces and other food products made by our Knorr brand.
We also buy a range of high-quality fruit, including strawberries, guava, mango, raspberries and bananas. These are especially important for our ice cream brands, such as Ben & Jerry’s, Magnum, Carte D’Or and Breyers.
With such a wide range of ingredients, we need a diverse supply chain. We buy fruit and vegetables from around 500 suppliers, who in turn buy from around 50,000 growers and farmers.
Partnerships that drive sustainable change
Our expert buyers seek the best quality ingredients from growers around the world. The scale and diversity of this supply chain gives us a great opportunity to make a positive environmental and social impact. But at the same time, it creates complexity when it comes to ensuring a sustainable supply of vegetables – especially as climate change impacts production, prompting us to look for new sources for ingredients. This complexity is reinforced by the fact that currently there is limited availability of vegetables certified as sustainable.
So working in partnership with others is critical if we’re to source our ingredients sustainably.
We work closely with our farmers and suppliers to help them meet the Unilever Sustainable Agriculture Code (SAC) standard and our new Regenerative Agriculture Principles, or we recognise equivalent standards provided they match our own. We also support many wider partnership initiatives to drive improvements. For example, we helped establish the Sustainable Agriculture Initiative (SAI) PlatformOpens in new window. The SAI helps us identify links with other fast-moving consumer goods companies who buy from the same suppliers, and agree common standards.
Knorr Sustainability Partnership Fund
Knorr is sold in around 90 countries. It’s our largest food brand and one of the world’s largest brands. While Knorr has worked closely with farmers for 183 years, for the last decade it’s been working to make a positive change across the food system – from the way food is grown to the way it’s consumed. Through its Sustainability Partnership Fund (PDF 2.67MB)Opens in new window, Knorr is supporting suppliers and farmers to make change on the ground.
Knorr’s Sustainability Partnership Fund supports sustainable farming projects with suppliers around the world. Knorr will invest 50% of any agreed project budget for initiatives that help nature such as promoting biodiversity, reducing pesticides, preserving water or applying regenerative principles. The other 50% is matched by the supplier or grower. The idea of the fund is to help suppliers try out new ideas and tackle complex sustainability projects that they may not be able to handle alone.
Sustainable cocoa
Cocoa is a vital ingredient for many of our brands. We're working with partners to source 100% sustainable cocoa so that we can ensure our supply chain is resilient and we can meet consumer demand.
Global commodities need a collective approach
Cocoa is a global commodity with a complex supply chain. Cultivating cocoa provides livelihoods for millions of people, but is also associated with issues such as deforestation, water impacts and human rights risks – issues we want to play our part in eliminating.
We buy only a small proportion of the global production of cocoa. That means that we cannot change the supply chain just by acting on our own. Partnerships and collaborations are an essential part of our approach.
In particular, we work with suppliers through long-standing certification schemes like the Rainforest Alliance. These have helped drive standards across these sectors, and are a powerful tool when it comes to monitoring sustainable agricultural practices.
Sourcing certified cocoa
We've made significant progress through certification of cocoa, which we mainly use in our ice cream brands such as Magnum, Wall’s and Ben & Jerry’s.
The Rainforest AllianceOpens in new window works to conserve biodiversity and improve smallholder farm practices through its Sustainable Agriculture Standard. The Standard promotes ecosystem conservation, worker rights (including the prohibition of child labour), safety and wildlife protection. It also covers topics like water and soil conservation, agrochemical reduction, legal wages and contracts for workers.
Now, 99% of the cocoa we source for Magnum is Rainforest Alliance Certified™ and 100% of all the other cocoa we use is sustainably sourced.
Our 2025 cocoa strategy
We buy around 1.5% of the global production of cocoa, mainly sourced from Côte d’Ivoire and Ghana.
We're determined to source 100% of our cocoa sustainably – but we know we need to go further to generate systemic change. This is why we've set ourselves the goal of going further, through impact programmes that complement the work of certification programmes and bring us closer to the people who grow our ingredients.
We have already mapped over 85% of our direct cocoa supply chain, together with our suppliers, to improve traceability and better understand where our cocoa comes from. We publish our direct suppliers in our Unilever Tier 1 and Tier 2 Cocoa Suppliers List (PDF 120KB)Opens in new window.
By 2025, we aim to have reached at least a third of the cocoa farmers in our direct sourcing with tailored impact programmes that have three key aims:
-
-
-
Sustainable sourcing tools
We offer a number of tools to our suppliers to help them embed more sustainable sourcing practices:
The Cool Farm ToolOpens in new window: This tool calculates the greenhouse gas balance of farming, including emissions from fields, inputs, livestock, land use and land use change and primary processing. It’s ideal for farmers, supply chain managers and companies interested in measuring and reducing their agricultural carbon footprint.
Biodiversity Action Plan: The Unilever Sustainable Agriculture Code requires our suppliers or farmers to prepare a Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP). We have prepared guidance that should be useful to all those who are preparing BAPs as it provides a standard, structured approach.
Sustainable sugar
Towards a sustainable global sugar supply
We’re working towards sourcing all our sugar from sustainable sources. We buy beet sugar and cane sugar from a number of countries spanning Asia, the Americas, Europe and Africa, each of which can have very different supply chains and challenges. While we’re proud of the progress we’ve made, in the longer term, our aim is to help create a global supply of sustainable sugar.
We believe the best way to achieve this is to harmonise the sustainable sourcing codes of the food and drink industries and forge them into a single standard, which can have an impact at scale. That’s why we have helped develop the Farm Sustainability Assessment (FSA) through the Sustainable Agriculture Initiative (SAI) PlatformOpens in new window, which has been agreed by many businesses in the food and beverage industries and gives farmers a single, simplified sustainability framework to work to assess and improve their farm performance.
Bonsucro – making sugar supplies more transparent
We support the BonsucroOpens in new window standard, which aims to improve standards of production in the cane sugar industry, including by increasing the proportion of physically certified sugar from sugar cane. We continue to buy Bonsucro credits while working with Bonsucro and others in the Americas and Asia to apply a combined approach of credits and certifying supply chains.
Sustainable dairy
Dairy farms are important parts of our brands' ingredient supply chain, particularly for our ice cream business. We encourage high standards among the farmers we source from – including standards of animal welfare, greenhouse gas reduction and biodiversity management.
The programmes that deliver our sustainable dairy commitment
Our Unilever Sustainable Agriculture Code (SAC) and Regenerative Agriculture Principles (RAPs) set out requirements for suppliers and farmers of all our raw materials, including dairy.
Our Livestock Implementation Guides were developed with the help of our external partners FAI Farms (Farm Animals Initiative) in 2013. They outline specific advice for livestock farming and animal welfare.
For our dairy farmers, we provide extra guidance including on the treatment of cows and calves, pasture management, and the management of manure, silage, run-off and other nutrient sources, as well as pesticides and veterinary medicines and many other criteria.
We support this guidance with training for farmers, including in the use of the Cool Farm Tool, which assesses emissions of greenhouse gases; the Cow Compass (a way of monitoring animal welfare); and advice on how to set action plans to improve energy use and enhance biodiversity.
In addition, Caring Dairy is our continuous improvement programme for the farmers who supply the milk and cream for Ben & Jerry’s ice cream in both North America and Europe.
Relationships with farmers are crucial
Suppliers and farmers around the world are achieving Unilever’s sustainable dairy standard.
But farming is rarely the same in two places – so while we have a shared set of standards, our approach can look very different from one farmyard to another. Our dairy ingredients come from large farms, from cooperatives and from smallholders who might own between two and five cows – so one size does not fit all.
We’re now working on a model to roll out this programme, including through flagship farms which demonstrate the improvements for other farmers.
With the Dairy Farmers of America, we’re also trialling an approach to reduce greenhouse gas emissions while improving animal health and welfare. Over 2019–2020, we explored the benefits of a probiotic feed additive with one of our suppliers, with the aim of reducing emissions of methane.
Working with our supply chain
At the same time as working with individual farming groups, we want to collaborate across the sector to achieve higher sustainability standards. We work with the Dairy Sustainability Framework, developed by SAI Platform, which seeks to create a holistic approach to sustainability in the global dairy value chain and align the goals of buyers and producers.
This has led to the launch of the Sustainable Dairy Partnership (SDP).Opens in new window The SDP is what is known as a 'business-to-business' sustainability model, bringing us together with other buyers, and with suppliers representing 30% of global milk volume. It’s built on the Dairy Sustainability Framework (DSF)Opens in new window and its 11 criteria addressing sustainability issues. The SDP also requires all milk processors to address the prevention of deforestation, the protection of animal welfare and human rights, and compliance with local legislation.
Supporting regenerative farming in dairy
Regenerative farming requires system-level changes to the way farmers manage their land. Ben & Jerry’s Caring DairyOpens in new window initiative aims to encourage and support practices like this on dairy farms. It has helped cooperatives supply ingredients for Ben & Jerry’s ice cream in Europe and the US since the brand co-founded the initiative in 2002. It aims to support thriving livelihoods for farmers and farm workers, excellent care for cows, and a flourishing ecosystem that combats climate change through building soil health and sequestering carbon.
Farmers who manage to improve are compensated, based on a third-party audit. Beyond meeting Caring Dairy’s Basic Requirements, farmers can reach Silver or Gold level performance, with increasing reward for each level.
Dairy farming for nature
Ben & Jerry’s Caring Dairy programme asks dairy farmers to measure themselves against 12 indicators of sustainable and regenerative agriculture – and keep improving. Examples of best practice include planting cover crops to reduce soil erosion, planting without tilling the land (and so keeping more carbon in the soil) and reducing fertiliser use.
Sustainable tea – leading the industry
Using our knowledge to make lives better
With the tea we produce, you could brew over 16 million cups every hour. That means we need to source tea at enormous scale: which in turn means we support the livelihoods of more than 1 million people in 21 countries who work in tea estates belonging to us or our suppliers, or on small farms.
With this scale, we can produce some of the biggest and most innovative names in tea – brands such as Lipton, PG tips, Brooke Bond Red Label, T2, Tazo, Pure Leaf and Pukka, among many others.
It also gives us a unique understanding of the tea industry and its deep-rooted challenges – and a huge opportunity to make a difference to the lives of the people it depends on.
By respecting and valuing the human rights of tea workers and smallholder farmers, and working to improve their health and financial security while protecting and nurturing the land they work on, we aim to set the example for the industry.
The Ethical Tea Partnership
We are a committed member of the Ethical Tea PartnershipOpens in new window, a not-for-profit organisation which brings together the tea industry with development partners, NGOs and governments to improve the lives of tea workers, farmers and the environment in which they live and work.
Tackling social issues in the tea supply chain
Around the world, we're working on a range of programmes that aim to create better lives for people in the tea supply chain, both within and beyond our own tea estates in Kenya, Tanzania and Rwanda.
The tea industry faces a number of social challenges. Worker wages are often low and there are worrying incidences of human rights abuses including violence against women. Our programmes aim to put an end to this – and are making a difference.
For example, we’ve reached more than 600,000 people with our women’s empowerment programmes in Kenya and India.
Protecting the land for future generations
As well as our social programmes, we work on nature-based projects on our tea farms like smart agriculture, water conservation and pesticide reduction.
Tea workers and farmers depend on the land to grow their tea – and we're committed to nurturing it so that future generations will continue to benefit. We're continuing to build on programmes that implement sustainable and regenerative farming practices including improving soil, crop quality, biodiversity, tea plant breeding and reforestation.
To take one example, we've planted 1.3 million trees across our Unilever Tea Kenya estates, and donated a further 30,000 indigenous trees to local communities and institutions.
Ensuring tea has a long-term future
Many crops, including tea, face enormous challenges from climate change. To increase the resilience of tea, we’re doing a number of things. We worked with the Crop Trust to develop a global conservation strategy, building on our work of sourcing more than 1,000 tea varieties from around the world in order to map tea's genetic diversity.
We’re now working to accelerate the breeding of tea varieties more resilient to climate change. And with Microsoft AI for Earth and Cranfield University’s Centre for Environmental and Agricultural Informatics, we’re bringing in digital agricultural solutions to boost yields sustainably on our tea estate in Kenya.
Towards a transparent tea industry
We want consumers to understand where their tea comes from, because transparency is a key ingredient in our ambition to make the tea industry fairer and more sustainable. Greater scrutiny of our supply chains helps us work more effectively with partners and suppliers to bring about positive change.
In September 2019, we took an important step forward by publishing a list of all our global suppliers (PDF 493KB)Opens in new window of black and green tea – a list we’ll update annually.
Partnerships for change
We'll only achieve our social and environmental ambitions for tea if we work with others, from tea growers, suppliers and NGOs to local and national governments and the wider industry. Public–private partnerships are an important way for us to do this.
One of our longest-running partnerships of this kind was in Kenya, with the Kenya Tea Development Agency (KTDA) and IDH (The Sustainable Trade Initiative). Since 2006, we have enabled 86,000 lead farmers – including around 42,000 women – to train at Farmer Field Schools. This practical training helps farmers increase yields sustainably, share best practice with others and improve crop quality, as well as improve their own health and wellbeing.
Building progress through certification
Certification is another important way to drive positive change in our tea supply chain, and we have a long history of supporting it.
In 2007, we supported the Rainforest Alliance to develop local indicators for sustainable tea production in Kenya. We began to certify our tea farms, helping to transform both our own supply chain and the wider industry. Through this, we became the first major tea company to commit to sustainably sourcing tea on a large scale, and Kericho, our largest tea estate in Kenya, was the first tea farm to achieve Rainforest Alliance certification.
Today, Rainforest Alliance Certified™ tea accounts for around 20% of the world’s tea production, and we work with suppliers in 14 countries in Africa and Asia to train smallholder farmers so they can achieve farm certification.
We were also a founding member of trustea, the Indian tea industry collaboration on sustainability. By the end of 2019, 653 factories and tea estates had achieved trustea verification, impacting around 55,670 smallholders and 619,500 tea estate workers, over half of whom were women.
Non-renewables sourcing
By working with our suppliers and the extraction industry on traceability and standards for responsible sourcing, we aim to increase our positive social impacts while building trust in our brands' supply chains.
Many of the raw materials we use each year to make our products are classified as non-renewable. Around 6 million tonnes of these originate from minerals or metals extracted from the earth. However, the extraction and processing of minerals are sometimes associated with human rights issues. Our Responsible Sourcing Policy guides us in managing our risks to ensure we have supply chains that consumers can trust.
We have a three-part approach to sourcing these non-renewable materials:
- developing traceability in our supply chain down to individual extraction sites
- working with industry to co-create standards for responsible extraction, and
- making a positive impact on the livelihoods of those who work in the non-renewables supply chain.
As we’re not a major player in the area of mineral extraction, we work with suppliers and other industry players to collectively drive responsible sourcing of these materials. We’ve been working on this area for a number of years, which culminated in the creation of the Code for Responsible Extraction (CORE) that we co-created in 2015 with the NGO Solidaridad, as well as supplier and industry partners.
CORE offers a globally acceptable and credible assurance to buyers and other stakeholders that industrial minerals are extracted in a responsible way. It’s independently audited and helps suppliers make continual improvements towards five objectives:
- Governance and legality: enhance compliance with legal requirements and improve governance
- Labour and employment: improve working conditions and ensure labour rights are protected
- Occupational health, safety and security: provide safe and healthy workplaces
- Environment and ecosystem: avoid or minimise adverse impacts on the environment
- Community and stakeholders: respect the rights and aspirations of affected communities.
Increasing our reach through CORE
Where can we have the most impact – on society and on our business – and how can we achieve it? These are the questions that we asked ourselves, and our partners, when we developed and launched CORE.
Around half the non-renewables we buy originate in India and China. Those countries were also identified as places where we had the greatest opportunities both to manage our supply chain risk and build trust and to improve the livelihoods of workers.

jpmorganchase,https://www.jpmorganchase.com/impact/sustainability ,"Our Commitment to Sustainable Development
In 2020, our firm set a target to finance and facilitate $200 billion to drive action on climate change and advance sustainable development. We are proud to report we exceeded our 2020 sustainable development target and facilitated more than $220 billion in transactions during the year, including more than $55 billion toward green initiatives.
Now, we have raised the bar for ourselves: JPMorgan Chase aims to facilitate more than $2.5 trillion over the next 10 years to address climate change and contribute to sustainable development, including $1 trillion for green initiatives.
Our sustainable development activities are focused in three areas:
- Green: Supporting climate action, with the goal of accelerating the deployment of solutions for cleaner sources of energy and facilitating the transition to a low-carbon economy
- Development Finance: Mobilizing capital to advance the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in emerging economies
- Community Development: Advancing economic inclusion in developed markets
Our Paris-Aligned Financing Commitment
In October 2020, JPMorgan Chase announced we are adopting a financing commitment that is aligned to the goals of the Paris Agreement. As part of our strategy, we intend to help clients navigate the challenges and capitalize on the long-term economic and environmental benefits of transitioning to a low-carbon world.
As part of this commitment, we are launching the Center for Carbon Transition (“CCT”) to provide clients in the Corporate & Investment Bank and Commercial Banking with centralized access to sustainability-focused financing, research and advisory solutions. The CCT will also engage clients on their long-term business strategies and related carbon disclosures.
We are also expanding upon our 100 percent renewable energy target by committing to become carbon neutral in our operations beginning in 2020.
For more information read our full press release, as well as this article from Daniel Pinto, co-President and COO of JPMorgan Chase and CEO of its Corporate & Investment Bank, and Ashley Bacon, Chief Risk Officer of JPMorgan Chase & Co.
At JPMorgan Chase, we believe that climate change is a critical issue of our time and have long supported the goals of the Paris Agreement. However, the world is not currently on track to meet these goals, and we recognize we do not have time to lose when it comes to climate action.
Our business strives to do its part in collaboration with our clients, as well as policymakers, who have a critical role to play in creating the frameworks needed to advance significant reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions globally.
As part of this commitment, our goal is to help clients navigate the challenges, and capitalize on the long-term economic and environmental benefits of transitioning to a low-carbon world.
We recognize that significant changes in policy and the creation of new technologies will ultimately be required to reach net-zero GHG emissions by 2050. To that end, JPMorgan Chase will continue to advocate for market-based policy solutions, including a price on carbon, and the commercialization of new technologies that can help advance deep decarbonization.
For example, the firm is a Founding Partner of Rocky Mountain Institute’s Center for Climate-Aligned Finance, which is developing practical solutions for financial institutions seeking to pursue the goals of the Paris Agreement in relation to relevant business activities. In addition, JPMorgan Chase is a member of the Climate Leadership Council and Business Roundtable, the latter of which published a new set of principles in 2020 to guide the development of effective climate policy.
The Paris Agreement aims to hold the increase in global average temperature to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, and ideally, to 1.5 degrees Celsius – which would require the world to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.
As part of our commitment, JPMorgan Chase will establish intermediate emission targets for 2030 for its financing portfolio. We will focus on the oil and gas, electric power and automotive manufacturing sectors and set targets on a sector-by-sector basis.
To help advance the transition to a low-carbon economy and track progress towards Paris, the firm will aim to evaluate its clients’ carbon intensity, which tracks emissions relative to unit of output. When measured over time, carbon intensity provides insight into changes in efficiency, performance and business strategy.
While a growing number of companies have been working to align their business strategies with the goals of the Paris Agreement, significant challenges exist, such as the lack of comprehensive and high-quality GHG emissions data and the complexities of mapping transition pathways that align with Paris targets. We are evaluating a variety of tools and approaches available and will focus on incorporating the best available information to guide our strategy.
We are focusing on these three sectors because they are responsible for a significant share of GHG emissions from the global energy value chain. JPMorgan Chase aims to work with clients in these sectors to advance the goals of Paris, including by reducing GHG emissions and expanding investment in low- and zero-carbon energy sources.
We are exploring ways to most effectively address all emissions, including Scope 3 emissions, which are relevant for sectors where the majority of GHGs are generated at other points in the supply chain.
We have seen a steady increase in the number of companies who have expressed support for achieving net zero emissions by 2050 and announcing goals to align their GHG emissions trajectories with the Paris Agreement.
While we anticipate seeing more such commitments from companies over time, transition pathways will be industry-specific, and strategies for individual companies will likely look different. We recognize that, for most companies, there will be opportunities to reduce GHG emissions and improve efficiency, yet it may not be feasible for every company to significantly transition their business models or strategies.
To support Corporate & Investment Bank and Commercial Banking clients with their sustainability and energy-transition goals, we are launching the Center for Carbon Transition (CCT). This new global group will work in close partnership with industry coverage, capital markets, and other teams across the firm to provide clients with centralized access to sustainability-focused financing, research and advisory solutions. The CCT will also engage with clients on their long-term business strategies and related carbon disclosures.
While net zero emissions by 2050 is an important goal, there remains a significant gap between the path the world is on today and the changes to our global energy system that will be needed to get there.
Successfully reaching the goals of the Paris Agreement is contingent upon a significant amount of technology creation and policy action. To close the gap, significant investment and policy solutions will be needed to expand deployment of existing low- and zero-carbon technologies, and support the commercialization of other new technologies that can advance deep decarbonization.
Carbon neutrality is defined as reducing direct emissions as much as possible and then turning to solutions “outside the fence line” for the remainder.
We’ve already made substantial commitments towards our operational footprint to date, including sourcing renewable energy for 100 percent of the firm’s power needs starting in 2020 and offsetting 100 percent of our Scope 3 emissions from employee travel every year since 2008.
We will meet our 100 percent renewable energy commitment by generating and purchasing energy and corresponding renewable energy certificates in an amount equivalent to the total megawatt hours of electricity that the firm consumes globally over the year. Over time, our goal is to meet our commitment on an annual basis in a way that maximizes our impact by bringing more renewable energy onto the grid.
To achieve operational carbon neutrality, we will explore additional opportunities to invest in new building efficiency measures and, for the remainder, we will purchase verified carbon offsets equivalent to the emissions we haven’t been able to eliminate.
We are planning to share more details about our commitments in our next climate report, which will be informed by the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures and will be published in Spring 2021. The firm will also provide ongoing updates on its progress over time.
Our Operational Impact
Minimizing the environmental impact of our physical operations continues to be an important part of the global sustainability strategy at JPMorgan Chase. We will meet our 100 percent renewable energy commitment in 2020 by generating and purchasing energy and corresponding RECs in an amount equivalent to the total megawatt hours of electricity that JPMorgan Chase consumes globally over the year.
Expanding upon our 100 percent renewable energy target, we commit to become carbon neutral in our operations beginning in 2020. This commitment will cover all of JPMorgan Chase’s direct carbon emissions from our corporate buildings and branches, indirect emissions from the generation of purchased electricity, and emissions from employee travel.

What is sustainability?
Sustainability means different things to different people. To the Danes, sustainability is a holistic approach that includes renewable energy, water management, waste recycling, and green transportation including the bicycling culture.
Through decades of extraordinary and sustained efforts, Denmark has built a world-class green energy system that delivers a cleaner everyday life and more green energy.
In particular, Denmark has focused on making buildings more energy-efficient, an important contributor in a country where heating is required for more than half of the year.
Danish companies are among the global market leaders when it comes to making buildings efficient, particularly Rockwool (insulation), Velux (windows), Danfoss (heating applications), and Grundfos (careful use of water.)

Shipping green
Another field in which Denmark is setting the course for sustainability is shipping.
Maersk Line of the A.P. Moller – Maersk Group is the world’s largest container shipping company and one of the largest companies in Denmark. Maersk has made it a priority to address the CO2 impact of shipping, which is expected to grow up to 250 % by 2050 without an intervention, according to the International Maritime Organisation.
The newest addition to Maersk's fleet, eleven Triple-E second-generation container ships, will cut CO2 emissions by 35 percent per container moved compared to the industry average for Asia-Europe trade. A full 400 meters long, they are the largest vessels currently in use and the most environmentally efficient container vessels ever made.
Sustainable Samso
In the very middle of Denmark lies Samso island, famous for its delicious potatoes. Since 2007, Samso has been 100 % sustainable, relying entirely on renewable energy such as wind, solar, and biomass energy.
To meet that goal, many of Samso's inhabitants replaced their oil-burning heaters and insulated their homes.
Now the island is implementing a new strategy for re-using all waste. A new biogas plant will even produce the necessary power for the ferry ""Princess Isabella"" that connects Samso with mainland Denmark. . Sustainability in Denmark

unglobalcompact,https://www.unglobalcompact.org/what-is-gc/our-work/environment https://www.unglobalcompact.org/what-is-gc/our-work/sustainable-development ," . Today’s business landscape is characterized by an unprecedented, accelerating and complex mix of risks and opportunities. Your entire market can be disrupted in a short time by innumerable factors, be it a new technology or a sudden lack of natural resources. New markets are emerging rapidly due to megatrends such as population growth, resource scarcity or global health risks. Meanwhile, consumers and investors are better informed than ever before – and they want businesses to take responsibility for the pressure our planet and its population are under.
There is growing understanding – especially by business leaders and investors ahead of the curve – that it is not enough for companies to concern themselves only with short-term profits because natural disasters, social unrest or economic disparity can damage long-term prosperity. The businesses that understand this challenge and take action will be a step ahead.
On 1 January 2016, the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development — adopted by world leaders in September 2015 at an historic UN Summit — officially came into force. Over the next fifteen years, with these new goals that universally apply to all, countries will mobilize efforts to end all forms of poverty, fight inequalities and tackle climate change, while ensuring that no one is left behind.
It is clear that the SDGs not only identify where we have to be in 2030 to create a sustainable world, they also outline new markets and opportunities for companies all over the world. To succeed, we must turn the global goals into local business. The UN Global Compact is committed to be a leading catalyst of that transformation. We will devote our capacities and global network to make it happen – based on the sound values and principles that the UN Global Compact is built upon. .
